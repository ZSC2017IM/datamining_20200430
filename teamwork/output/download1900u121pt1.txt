AB Purpose
   Blockchain, which was originally created to enable peer-to-peer digital payment systems (bitcoin), is considered to have several benefits for different sectors, such as the real estate one. In a standard European-wide real estate transaction, several intermediaries are involved. As a consequence, these agreements are usually time-consuming and involve extra difficulties to cross-border operations. As blockchain, combined with smart contracts, may have an important role in these transactions, this paper aims to explore its prospective challenges, limitations and opportunities in the real estate sector and discover how the traditional intermediaries have to face a possible implementation of this technology.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper analyses the current intermediaries in the real estate sector in European Union (EU), their functions and how can blockchain strengthen the security of these transactions while reducing their time. The author uses a legal methodology to approach it.
   Findings
   Blockchain, combined with smart contracts, has both challenges and opportunities for the real estate sector. On the one hand, it may improve procedures, allow EU transactions and the interconnection between public administration. However, to not reduce parties rights, this blockchain should have some special features, such as the possibility of being amended.
   Originality/value
   This paper provides a valuable overview of all the intermediaries that could be affected by blockchain protocols. It is of interest of blockchain developers, public administrations and researchers who are working on blockchain and property conveyancing.

AB Mobile crowd sourcing offers a way for an organization to gain afar their "base of minds" of workforce offers in the form of idea competitions or innovation contests where task is divided among individuals to achieve a pooled result using mobile devices. However, mobile crowd sourcing consequence to an urban bias in addition to other key challenging issues such as safety, privacy and connectivity or data fault tolerance. Fault tolerance in mobile crowd sourcing is a property to tolerate any fault related to data collected or the working of the system. Further, it is needed to ensure a secure resilient mechanism due to de-centralized behavior of the network. In this paper, we have proposed a resilient-improved two-stage auction (ITA) and blockchain mechanism in mobile crowd sourcing beneficial for the organizations. The resilient technique and secure scheme is beneficial for the organizations that select the workers according to their budget and time. Further, an akka API tool is implemented upon already existing mobile crowd sourcing technique i.e. ITA. The proposed resilient mechanism is initially implemented over. The proposed resilient ITA mechanism is analyzed over further crowd sourcing mechanisms needed for workers selection in order to benefit the organizations. Further, the resilient-ITA is measured against database connection loss that is considered as a promising type of fault occurring during the workers selection.

ID MARKET NOR HIERARCHY; NETWORK
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to assist records managers and information governance professionals to understand the challenges presented by their organization's use of blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT).
   Design/methodology/approach
   An extensive literature review was conducted, which revealed a multitude of articles based on research into blockchain DLT, most written from the technology perspective. This paper differs in that it applies a records management lens to an analysis of the records created, registered or stored on a blockchain. A six-stage blockchain records consideration model is provided to illustrate examples of the records management challenges presented by the implementation of blockchain DLT. Questions are posed and recommendations are made to aid the reader in developing a blockchain DLT records management and information governance strategy.
   Findings
   Because there is no one universal configuration for a blockchain DLT solution, each implementation must be analyzed to understand the resultant records management and information governance challenges. A series of questions that should be asked and answered can not only help records management and information governance professionals adapt their policies and practices to the technology but also provide a basis for discussion with those designing the blockchain DLT solutions so they can include records management features in their designs.
   Originality/value
   This paper contributes an original analysis of the implications of the adoption of Blockchain DLT for records management and information governance programs through the lens of a six-stage Blockchain Records Consideration Model.

DE algorithmic decentralization; cryptoeconomics; automation; forking;
   blockchain governance; human-machine labour
AB In recent years the development of cryptocurrencies and wider implementations of blockchain technology have been valourized as digitally decentralized networks that dissipate control evenly among their peers. With Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, monetary policy is enacted via software built through an open source consensus model. This promotes a techno-decentralist ideology that promises to democratize societies by eradicating centralized points of control in economic systems. Contrastingly, this paper demonstrates how Bitcoin's production process operates through strict authoritative channels. The overall political framework for altering the Bitcoin code is described as senatorial governance: a (de)centralized model of bureaucratic parties who compete to change the monetary policy (codified rules) of the protocol. This model shows how Bitcoin is not an autonomous system but is assembled and maintained via human discretion.

AB Cryptoassets have emerged as a new category of financial products in recent years and have attracted a great deal of attention from market participants and regulators. While the characteristics of cryptoassets, such as anonymity and disintermediation in transactions, bring significant benefits, they come with a range of significant risks concerning investor protection and market integrity. Due to the difficulties in regulating cryptoassets under the traditional framework, Hong Kong has set up its first comprehensive regulatory regime on cryptoassets in November 2018, imposing new standards on cryptoasset fund managers, distributors and platform operators. By means of a comparison with four major jurisdictions overseas, including Mainland China, the US, the UK, and Singapore, the strengths and potential concerns of Hong Kong's new regime are analysed. Overall, the new regulatory regime for cryptoassets in Hong Kong is a significant development, addressing the issues of regulatory gaps and regulatory arbitrage that existed under the previous framework as well as introducing enhanced regulatory standards. This has the effect of improving investor protection, but there are some remaining concerns. Chief amongst them are the problems with regulatory scope, the application of traditional regulatory standards to cryptoassets that do not fall within the definition of securities or futures, problems with the sandbox mechanism, and ultimately as a matter of regulatory philosophy, the need for a better balance between investor protection and market development.

AB Growing environmental awareness and widening extended producer responsibility have heightened the need for economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable business strategies levered by digital technologies. As an extension, various take-back policies focusing on product waste and recovery are put in place by the high-tech manufacturing industry. With an attempt to increase sales while ensuring the environmental sustainability of products, trade-in programmes that incentivize consumers to exchange used goods for new and most recent technology products became a value-adding strategy for businesses. Due to the high unpredictability in the quality of returned devices however, determining trade-in margins is a challenging task for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This inevitably reveals the need for incorporating intelligent technologies into the formation of manufacturing and logistics architectures to simultaneously preserve OEMs profitability and ensure the sustainable development of the closed-loop supply chain activities. With this motivation, this study presents the use of IoT-embedded products in a blockchain-enabled disassembly-to-order system to determine the optimal trade-in-to-upgrade policy. A discrete-event simulation model is developed to obtain the expected cost of the disassembly-to-order system. Optimal incentives for varying product qualities are then computed by utilising this cost in the trade-in policy model.

AB Cryptocurrencies and the underpinning blockchain technology have gained unprecedented public attention recently. In contrast to fiat currencies, transactions of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, are permanently recorded on distributed ledgers to be seen by the public. As a result, public availability of all cryptocurrency transactions allows us to create a complex network of financial interactions that can be used to study not only the blockchain graph, but also the relationship between various blockchain network features and cryptocurrency risk investment. We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or blockchain motifs, to utilize this information. Chainlets allow us to evaluate the role of local topological structure of the blockchain on the joint Bitcoin and Litecoin price formation and dynamics. We investigate the predictive Granger causality of chainlets and identify certain types of chainlets that exhibit the highest predictive influence on cryptocurrency price and investment risk.

TI BArt: Trading digital contents through digital assets

AB Since digital artworks are indeed digital content, they face the inherent problem digital content has: the link between content and its original author is very difficult to keep. Additionally, retaining control over digital copies of the content is also a challenging task. Digital coins have solved this very same problem through cryptocurrencies (for instance, Bitcoin) and have opened the door to apply the same techniques to other similar scenarios where ownership of digital assets needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose BArt, a transparent and distributed mechanism for artists to commercialize their digital artwork, keeping control of the copies, monetizing its usage, and maintaining ownership. BArt allows artists to publicly register their work in the Bitcoin blockchain and sell usage rights in exchange for bitcoins. Buyers are allowed to exert the acquired rights. Proper behavior from all parties is enforced by the system with cryptography and economic incentives.

AB This article analyzes specific characteristics of value created through digital scarcity and blockchain-proven ownership in cryptogames. Our object of study is CryptoKitties, the first instance of a blockchain-based game that has garnered media recognition and financial interest. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the limits of scarcity in value construction for owners of CryptoKitties tokens, manifested as breedable virtual cats. Our work extends the trends set out by earlier cryptocurrency studies from the perspective of cultural studies. For the purpose of this article, we rely on open blockchain analytics such as DappRadar and Etherscan, as well as player-created analytics, backed by a one-year-long participant observation period in the said game for research material. Combining theoretical cryptocurrency and Bitcoin studies, open data analysis, and virtual ethnography enables a grounded discussion on blockchain-based game design and play.

AB For the growth of an economy, the satisfactory and steady availability of energy supplies is necessary. A developing country (like Pakistan) encounters perpetual issues of power losses. This paper explores the challenges faced by the power economy in Pakistan. Furthermore, technologies to prevent power losses are studied and analyzed. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper proposes a power loss preventing solution by using Ethereum smart contracts. These contracts handle both sides of the power economy (the consumer and the grid) by ensuring the integrity and security of data. For the evaluation of our proposed solution, we implement the contracts and the results show that our solution is effective in reducing the line losses. The proposed solution is location independent and can be applied to economies facing similar issues.

AB With the development of the knowledge economy, science and technology play an increasingly crucial role in social development. Investment from the government and the enterprise in scientific research has increased significantly, and the number of scientific research projects has also shown an obvious upward trend. Due to the lack of a standardized and unified scientific research project management program, many projects are overdue or even failed, and project fund management is confused. Besides, output results are limited and the actual conversion rate is low. In this paper, we propose a scientific research project management system based on consortium blockchain. Firstly, the process of scientific research project management is standardized. According to this specification, we then design a scientific research project management system in line with consortium blockchain, the smart contract, and the IPFS system. By using these technologies, we have coped with two major problems in traditional scientific project management: breach of contract and confidentiality. The simulation results show that compared with the conventional scientific research project management, the scheme proposed in this paper can significantly enhance the efficiency and the success rate of the project, and reduce the time and manpower consumed in the process of project implementation.

ID EMERGENCE
AB The proposition that constitutional rules serve as permanent, fixed points of interaction is challenged by the existence of contestable rule amendment and the emergence of de facto authority. This observation not only applies to conventional political constitutions, but to the fundamental rules which govern interactions by numerous people using new forms of technology. Blockchain technology aims to coordinate action in a world of incomplete information and opportunism, but the governance arrangements in blockchain protocols remain far from settled. Drawing upon recent theoretical developments regarding constitutional change, we interpret changes to the fundamental working rules of blockchain protocols as central to the adaptive, emergent nature of activity within this technological space. We apply this concept of "constitutional catallaxy" to selected blockchain platform case studies, illustrating the dynamism inherent in establishing protocols within the blockchain. Blockchain coordination changes and adapts not only to the technological limitations of the available protocols, but to mutual expectations and influence of interacting stakeholders.

AB Due to the increasing prevalence of high-frequency algorithmic trading and fintech developments like blockchain, there is a shift towards very short trading horizons and immediate settlement. This creates a demand for an ultra-short tenor interest rate curve that is updated in real-time. Our paper develops a practical market model for the equilibrium intraday interest rates which provides market makers adequate incentives to attenuate flash crashes. Our model suggests that the intraday CHF interest rates should have been highly negative during the flash crash of EURCHF on 15 January 2015, which could potentially stop the long CHF short EUR strategy and reduce the severity of the crash.

AB Safeguarding consumer privacy is a key challenge for the growth of e-commerce. The dramatic technological changes advanced by online platforms, big data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, virtual assistants, and blockchain technology are transforming the way we shop online. This paradigm shift in e-commerce has only intensified the perplexities of privacy issues. Corresponding to the growing concerns of privacy in practice, research in this area has surged during the last two decades. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of consumer privacy research in business to consumer e-commerce and thereby understand what has been studied, what is omitted, and what potential research areas have emerged in the course of transformational technological changes. We conducted a systematic review of behavioral studies published on analyzing privacy concerns at the individual level during the last 20 years. We methodically analyzed the selected literature using the thematic analysis technique. The results revealed eight main themes. We present a taxonomy of consumer privacy concerns and a research agenda that could lead to a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of privacy dynamics in e-commerce.

AB There has been tremendous interest in blockchain technology (BT) (also known as distributed ledger technology) around the globe and across sectors. Following significant success in the financial sector, other sectors, such as humanitarian sector, have started deploying BT at various levels. Although the use of BT in the humanitarian sector is in its infancy, donors and government agencies are increasingly calling for building BT-enabled swift-trust (ST) and more collaborative relationships among various humanitarian actors in order to improve the transparency and traceability of disaster relief materials, information exchanges and flow of funds in disaster relief supply chains. Our study, which is informed by organisational information processing theory and relational view, proposes a theoretical model to understand how BT can influence operational supply chain transparency (OSTC) and ST among actors engaged in disaster relief operations. Our model also shows how BT-enabled ST can further improve collaboration (CO) among actors engaged in disaster relief operations and enhance supply chain resilience (SCR). We formulated and tested six research hypotheses, using data gathered from international non-governmental organisations with the help of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) database. We received 256 usable responses using a pre-tested survey-based instrument designed for key informants. Our results confirm that our six hypotheses were supported. Our study offers significant and valid contributions to the literature on ST, CO and SCR and BT/distributed ledger technology. We have also noted the limitations of our study and have offered future research directions.

AB Clinical trials (CTs) are essential for the advancement of medical research, paving the way for the development and adoption of new treatments, and contributing to the evolution of healthcare. An essential factor for the success of a CT is the appropriate management of its participants and their personal data. According to the current regulations, collecting and using personal data from participants must comply with rigorous standards. Therefore, healthcare institutes need to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent before being able to collect the data. Some of the major limitations of the current technological solutions are the lack of control over the granularity of consent grants, as well as the difficulty of handling dynamic changes of consent over time. In this paper, we present SCoDES, an approach for trusted and decentralized management of dynamic consent in clinical trials, based on blockchain technology (BCT). The usage of blockchain provides a set of features that allow maintaining consent information with trust guarantees while avoiding the need for a dedicated or centralized third trusted party. We provide a full implementation of SCoDES, made available as a self-contained infrastructure, with the possibility to interact with external services, and using hyperledger as a blockchain framework.

AB Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger system that establishes transparent contract processes and facilitates secure but trusted business transactions. Policy-makers around the world are intrigued by the potential of this emerging technology to solve policy problems, including the challenges of the transition away from centralised, linear models of energy generation and consumption towards decentralised and distributed energy systems. Blockchain has also been promoted as a mechanism to transform carbon markets, yet the focus in this area to date has been on using blockchain to create new carbon market schemes. This paper addresses an important research gap by asking how blockchain could be applied to an existing carbon market. To answer this question, the study uses an established design process to develop an Australian carbon market blockchain design. The paper finds that this design could improve the efficiency, equity and effectiveness of the Australian carbon market. This paper makes an important research contribution to carbon market policy development by developing a blockchain design that could improve how an existing carbon market functions, and the findings presented here are relevant to government and industry stakeholders globally.

AB The emergence of mobile cloud computing enables mobile users to offload computation tasks to other resource-rich mobile devices to reduce energy consumption and enhance performance. A direct peer-to-peer connection among mobile devices to offload computation tasks can be a highly promising solution to provide a fast mechanism, especially for deadline-sensitive offloading tasks. The generic blockchain-based system might fail in such a scenario due to it being a heavyweight mechanism requiring high power consumption in the mining process. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a directed acyclic graph-enabled mobile offloading (DAGMO) algorithm. DAGMO model is empowered by traditional blockchain features and provides additional advantages to overcome the fundamental limitations of generic blockchain. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the interactions between mobile devices. The numerical analysis proves the proposed model to enhance the overall welfare of the participating nodes in terms of computation cost and time.

AB The last few years have seen the emergence of a growing academic literature on the blockchain. On one side are the supporters, who see its potential to create a true, peer-to-peer (p2p) sharing economy. On the other side are the critics, who argue that the blockchain is more likely to reproduce capitalism than to disrupt it. Using the insights generated by the critical literature on the blockchain, this paper seeks to ask new questions and provide new insights about the development of this technology and how it is likely to transform the global political economy through its capacity to enforce global property rights.

AB Start-ups in the blockchain context generate millions by means of initial coin offerings (ICOs). Many of these crowdfunding endeavours are very successful, others are not. However, despite the increasing investments in ICOs, there is still neither sufficient theoretical knowledge nor a comprehensive understanding of the different types of business models and the implications for these token-based ecosystems. Scientific research equally lacks a thorough understanding of the different business model forms and their influence on collaboration in token-based economies. We bridge this gap by presenting a taxonomy of real-world blockchain-based start-ups. For this taxonomy, we used 195 start-ups and performed a cluster-analysis in order to identify three different archetypes and thus gain a deeper understanding. Our taxonomy and the archetypes can equally be seen as strategic guidance for practitioners as well as a starting point for future research concerning the token-based business models.

AB The accuracy and performance of deep neural network models become important issues as the applications of deep learning increase. For example, the navigation system of autonomous self-driving vehicles requires very accurate deep learning models. If a self-driving car fails to detect a pedestrian in bad weather, the result can be devastating. If we can increase the model accuracy by increasing the training data, the probability of avoiding such scenarios increases significantly. However, the problem of privacy for consumers and lack of enthusiasm for sharing their personal data, e.g., the recordings of their self-driving car, is an obstacle for using this valuable data. In Blockchain technology, many entities which cannot trust each other in normal conditions can join together to achieve a mutual goal. In this paper, a secure decentralized peer-to-peer framework for training the deep neural network models based on the distributed ledger technology in Blockchain ecosystem is proposed. The proposed framework anonymizes the identity of data providers and therefore can be used as an incentive for consumers to share their private data for training deep learning models. The proposed framework uses the Stellar Blockchain infrastructure for secure decentralized training of the deep models. A deep learning coin is proposed for Blockchain compensation.

AB Purpose The Industry 4.0 phenomenon is bringing unprecedented disruptions for all traditional business models and hastening the need for a redesign and digitisation of activities. In this context, the literature concerning the digital supply chain (DSC) and its capabilities are in the early stages. To bridge this gap, the purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for digital supply chain capabilities (DSCCs). Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a narrative literature approach, based on the main Industry 4.0 elements, supply chain and the emerging literature concerning DSC disruptions, to build an integrative framework to shed light on DSCCs. Findings The study identifies seven basic capabilities that shape the DSCC framework and six main enabler technologies, derived from 13 propositions. Research limitations/implications - The proposed framework can bring valuable insights for future research development, although it has not been tested yet. Practical implications - Managers, practitioners and all involved in the digitalisation phenomenon can utilise the framework as a starting point for other business digitalisation projects. Originality/value This study contributes to advancing the DSC literature, providing a well-articulated discussion and a framework regarding the capabilities, as well as 13 propositions that can generate valuable insights for other studies.

TI Towards a trusted unmanned aerial system using blockchain for the
   protection of critical infrastructure
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES

DT Article; Early Access
AB With the exponential growth in the number of vital infrastructures such as nuclear plants and transport and distribution networks, these systems have become more susceptible to coordinated cyberattacks. One of the effective approaches used to strengthen the security of these infrastructures is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance and data collection. However, UAVs themselves are prone to attacks on their collected sensor data. Recently, blockchain (BC) has been proposed as a revolutionary technology that can be integrated within Internet of things (IoT) to provide a desired level of security and privacy. However, the integration of BC within IoT networks, where UAV's sensors constitute a major component, is extremely challenging. The major contribution of this study is twofold:(1) survey the security issues for UAV's collected sensor data, define the security requirements for such systems, and identify ways to address them; and (2) propose a novel BC-based solution to ensure the security of and the trust between the UAVs and their relevant ground control stations. Our implementation results and analysis show that using UAVs as means for protecting critical infrastructure is greatly enhanced through the utilization of trusted BC-based unmanned aerial systems.

AB Multi-sided platforms are omnipresent in today's digital world. However, establishing a platform includes challenges: The platform utility usually increases with the number of participants. At an early stage, potential participants expect the platform utility to be low and lack an incentive to join (i.e., "chicken and egg" problem). Blockchain-enabled utility tokens hold the promise to overcome this problem. They supposedly provide a suitable financial incentive for their owners to join the platform as soon as possible. In the first half of 2018, investors seemed to believe in the presumption and spent more than US$ 17.6 billion in token sales. To date, we know little about this financial incentive in the context of the token economy. For this purpose, we model the token value development and the associated incentives in a multi-sided blockchain-enabled platform. The resulting findings suggest that blockchain-enabled utility tokens can help to overcome the "chicken and egg" problem. However, these tokens lead to contradictory incentives for platform participants, and can even inhibit platform usage. The contribution of our work is twofold: First, we develop one of the first models for token value development. Second, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the utility token's financial incentive.

AB Despite the anticipated benefits and the numerous announcements of pilot cases, we have seen very few successful implementations of blockchain technology (BCT) solutions in supply chains. Little is empirically known about the obstacles to blockchain adoption, particularly in a supply chain's interorganizational setting. In supply chains, blockchains' benefits, for example, BCT-based tracking and tracing, are dependent on a critical mass of supply chain actors adopting the technology. While previous research has mainly been conceptual and has lacked both theory and empirical data, we propose a theory-based model for interorganizational adoption of BCT. We use the proposed model to analyze a unique in-depth revelatory case study. Our case study confirms previous conceptual work and reveals a paradox as well as several tensions between drivers for and against (positive and negative determining factors, respectively) of BCT adoption that must be managed in an interorganizational setting. In this vertical context, the adoption and integration decision of one supply chain actor recursively affects the adoption and integration decisions of the other supply chain actors. This paper contributes midrange theory on BCT in supply chain management (SCM), future research directions, and managerial insights on BCT adoption in supply chains.

AB Automation is a direct result of digitalisation of different aspects of our lives. Where various functions have been automated, some are still being carried out manually. One such function is the verification of academic records which is still being done predominantly in manual fashion. Blockchain technology provides a solution for storing immutable records in distributed ledgers that can be verified anytime. This paper presents an architecture for digital verification of academic records using blockchain technology. The paper also presents an implementation of this architecture as a proof of concept.

TI Blockchain as a medium for transindividual collective
SO CULTURE THEORY AND CRITIQUE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Today, digitalisation is penetrating every corner of our mundane life, thus affecting our being in manifold ways. In spite of this, digital technologies provide us with paths towards advancing humanity. One way to model the possibilities of the new technologies in a sustainable way is to frame them in light of Gilbert Simondon's philosophy and especially his understanding of 'transindividuality', which is the foundation for a robust, evolving collective. The transindividual relation, mediated by technical objects, is the possibility of a concurrent problem-solving at the collective and individual level. One of these new technologies, blockchain, a decentralised peer-to-peer database, practically demonstrates a complex system that can cultivate this transindividuality. Although not without its flaws, blockchain nonetheless presents a serious innovation for collective being.

TI Triple-entry accounting with blockchain: How far have we come?
SO ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Triple-entry accounting; Blockchain; Accounting system
AB Although double-entry accounting has been used for more than 600 years, today's era of disruptive technological change utilising blockchain and FinTech has led to the emergence of another promising accounting method: triple-entry accounting. This paper explores triple-entry accounting, from its conception to the current state of play, using three case studies. We find that: (i) in a blockchain ecosystem, for some accounts, business entities will only need to perform a single entry internally and the opposite entry will be recorded in a public shared ledger; and (ii) triple-entry accounting is a new and a more efficient way to address fundamental trust and transparency issues that plague current accounting systems. Triple-entry accounting with blockchain, when properly implemented, can fundamentally improve accounting.

AB Digitalization and digital health are transforming research practices, while economic growth is increasingly driven by the information commons. In the case of biological sciences, information commons, such as public biobanks and free/libre open source software (FLOSS), are of paramount importance for both research and the bioeconomy. In a time of digitalization, however, information commons are vulnerable to violations, such as the free-rider problem, that render the commons unsustainable. Consequently, it has been argued that the enclosure of the informational common resources is the only means to effectively exploit them. Given the social and economic importance of the information commons, the new digital environment in biology and health requires governance innovation that will regulate the social embedding of the commons and their relationship to the free market, that is, a new political economy is needed. In this context, the need for a core common infrastructure, stretching from the physical to the logical and content layer of the information environment, that will guarantee the protection of the commons from both violations and enclosures, has been highlighted. Focusing on the interaction between two biological/bioinformatics commons, namely public biobanks and the FLOSS, we have set up an ecosystem relying on a blockchain technology. The proposed governance mechanism protects the information commons from the free-rider problem and guarantees their sustainability without hampering their operational framework. Our model demonstrates the interdependence and protection of the information commons not as an abstract theoretical exercise, but rather as a physical reality on the digital ontological matrix.

AB Chaotic image encryption has been greatly investigated in recent years. However, a considerable number of the encryption schemes had been cracked by chosen plaintext attack (CPA). Although the new proposed plaintext-related chaotic image encryption schemes can resist CPA effectively, the emerged key management problem is a hot potato. In this paper, a novel fingerprint-related chaotic image encryption scheme is proposed. The generation of key streams is affected by the fingerprints of distributors rather than the plaintexts of images. In addition, the blockchain framework is adopted to ensure that the encrypted image was sent correctly form the distributor. Moreover, the distributors' fingerprints embedded in the encrypted images are encoded by the anti-collusion code in order to record multiple fingerprints with fixed length of data. The proposed method has the following superiorities: 1) Security. CPA is invalid because the attacker does not have the fingerprint of the legal receiver. Meanwhile, no key management problem is caused. 2) Authenticity. The image, the sender and the receiver are all verified by using blockchain framework. 3) Traceability. All distributors' fingerprints can be extracted correctly from the merged fingerprint based on the anti-collusion code, and the transmission of the image can be traced.

AB Ethereum is a public, open-source, decentralized, and peer-to-peer blockchain-based computing network which is involving to the usefulness of smart contract. It gives a distributed Turing-complete virtual machine in which some codes can be executed by utilizing a worldwide and public network of nodes. The compelled certificate creation and Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks are two major attacks on End-to-End Encryption (EEE) and SSL/TLS. A portion of the real attacks on end-to-end encryption and SSL/TLS is IP/ARP poisoning and the phishing attack. MITM attack makes the client difficult to understand, whether they are associated with a unique verified and secured connection or not. Since the certificate and public-key that is being passed during the connection setup is unreliable and insecure, the attacker can undoubtedly change the data in the certificate and leaves the endorsement of the certificate and public-key to the client. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution of providing the legitimacy and authenticity of freely shared and published online digital data, e.g., digital certificates, cryptographic keys, and common reference strings such as shared passwords using a mix of recently developed innovations which primary include blockchain, smart contract, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and quantum-resistant Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol over rings and ideal lattices. Ethereum smart contract is utilized to manage, surveil, and give detectability and visibility into the history of digital data from its beginning to the most recent variant, in a way that it is decentralized and internationally accessed with high integrity, resiliency, and transparency, that we should thank to the immutability and irreversibility of the blockchain. The full code of our smart contract is given, with a discourse on the execution and testing of its key functionalities.

AB Despite of their increasing popularity, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are still suffering from major security problems, particularly during communications between the IoT devices. Indeed, these devices are commonly prone to malicious attacks and require prior mutual authentication to guarantee the confidentiality and security of data being shared as well as a proper network operation. In order to deal with this issue, several researchers have proposed the use of the emergent blockchain paradigm, which has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which information will be shared. As this paradigm is facing scalability and flexibility problems, the use of multi-agents systems has been adopted in recent works. However, current solutions are using agents for the rudimentary role of data collection only. In this paper, we propose to secure the IoT platform with a multilevel blockchain system (MBS) where the speed and flexibility of blockchain transactions are enforced by mobile agents which are migrating throughout the IoT network. The simulations of our solution through the Hyperledger Fabric are showing relevant results in terms of response time and energy consumption.

AB The Bitcoin model originated blockchain architectures and inspired their further development. Blockchain architectures are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. Bitcoin's rewards for Proof of Work mining became the default consensus technique for blockchains. As an alternative to reward mechanisms for blockchain maintenance, we propose punishment mechanisms for neglecting to maintain the blockchain (provided participants are intrinsically motivated to be beneficiaries of the blockchain application). Punishment not Reward is convincing for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, and potential punishment mechanisms include denial of service and/or revocation of confidentiality. This obviates the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem, and market manipulation demerits. The privacy concerns of competing entities participating in a blockchain application are prima facie in conflict with the needs of the community to be able to inflict punishment mechanisms. Conflicts of this kind can be addressed via sophisticated cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, multiparty computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and so on, which play a vital role. We stress the importance of correctly balancing all application specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications, so that the mix of incentives and disincentives is stabilizing.

AB In this article, we introduce a blockchain governance framework that defines the governance of a blockchain as a combination of six dimensions and three layers. An evaluation through eight expert interviews confirms the perceived usefulness and operational feasibility of the presented framework. Furthermore, the framework, is demonstrated by an application in two case studies. The introduced blockchain governance framework establishes a shared understanding and discussion surrounding the topic of blockchain governance.

AB LoRaWAN, part of the long range Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol that enables communication between the battery operated resource constrained devices. Although LoRaWAN provides system-level security, these networks are based on a basic assumption of trust between the network server and the user, which as a result empowers a network server with undue authorities. Moreover, the nature of the LoRaWAN join procedure, which is a key component for ensuring network operation, is highly susceptible to jamming and replay attacks through slight packet manipulation, thus making the network vulnerable. In order to address these deficiencies, we present a blockchain-based distributed framework for the LoRaWAN join procedure, in order to provide a secure and trusted authentication system within LoRaWAN networks. Our proposed solution eliminates the jamming and replay attack threats against the LoRaWAN join procedure and in addition builds trust among LoRa end devices and network servers. The framework is endorsed by a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation using the Ethereum blockchain which is used to evaluate the proposed system in realistic LoRaWAN network scenarios. The simulations results indicate that the proposed solution achieves efficient system performance up to an upper bound on the load level which involves 30 join requests from 1000 concurrent clients.

AB Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition. However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02-05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06-15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.

TI GARET: improving throughput using gas consumption-aware relocation in
   Ethereum sharding environments

AB Advances in blockchain technology have made a significant impact on a wide range of research areas due to the features such as transparency, decentralization and traceability. With the explosive growth of blockchain transactions, there has been a growing interest in improving the scalability of blockchain network. Sharding is one of the methods to solve this scalability problem by partitioning the network into several shards so that each shard can process the transactions in parallel. Ethereum places each transaction statically on a shard based on its account address without considering the complexity of the transaction or the load generated by the transaction. This causes the transaction utilization on each shard to be uneven, which makes the transaction throughput of the network decrease. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP) and proposes a heuristic algorithm called GARET. The GARET dynamically relocates the transaction load of each shard based on gas consumption to maximize the transaction throughput. Ethereum gas is a unit that represents the amount of computational effort needed to execute operations in a transaction. Benchmarking results show that GARET outperforms existing techniques by up to 12% in transaction throughput and decreases the makespan of transaction latency by about 74% under various conditions. It is also shown that the relocation overhead is minimal and does not affect the overall performance.

AB In this paper, we assess how recent technology advances have changed the way we coordinate. After a brief discussion of the common challenges to effective coordination, we highlight some important implications of technology on addressing informational and behavioral frictions. We focus on discussing the effects of three specific technology developments including artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and blockchain, on the choice of coordination modes. We argue that technology is shifting the boundaries between firms and markets and is opening the door to new research directions.

AB In this paper, we analyze the Ethereum blockchain using the complex networks modeling framework. Accounts acting on the blockchain are represented as nodes, while the interactions among these accounts, recorded on the blockchain, are treated as links in the network. Using this representation, it is possible to derive interesting mathematical characteristics that improve the understanding of the actual interactions happening in the blockchain. Not only, by looking at the history of the blockchain, it is possible to verify if radical changes in the blockchain evolution happened.

ID SECURITY
AB Cloud computing (CC) is a distributed and centralized network of interconnected and interrelated systems that has emerged as an area of incredible impact, potential, and growth in the IT domain. In the last few years, this paradigm has thrived to become the fastest evolutionary segment for business and various industries. Despite the many advantages provided by the cloud, serious challenges related to privacy and security have arisen such as privacy exposure, data loss, manipulation, service-level agreement (SLA) violation, and concerns over the service and deployment models. In this article, a blockchain-based hybrid algorithm is proposed to tackle the privacy inefficiency of existing tools. A novel hybrid technique is used to encrypt data ahead of outsourcing it to data centers, and a unique digital signature is generated at clients and stored on a decentralized set of blocks. A virtual cloud similar to actual cloud service infrastructure was built to test the proposed framework. Despite the additional computational powers needed to run the proposed framework due to blockchain integration, the results show that data integrity and reliability are preserved and user's privacy is increased. Our results are discussed and benchmarked against the standard privacy tests standards such as changes in the stored data, the negligible overheads on cloud performance, and the data records of the blockchain structure.

AB Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied.

ID POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; BITCOIN; RISK
AB Policy uncertainty created by regulatory authorities regarding the blockchain matters for the initial coin offering (ICO) market. Using an ICO dataset from four major cryptocurrency exchanges, we find that higher policy uncertainty regarding the blockchain leads to a lower return and a lower trading volume of an ICO on its first trading day. Although ICOs are decentralised by design and less vulnerable to direct regulatory intervention, we conclude that blockchain policy uncertainty constitutes an important component of the information environment of ICO ventures.

AB Blockchain technology has been enjoying rapid development in numerous areas where trust, safety, and global payments are deemed important. In this research, we introduce a framework that integrates blockchain technology with the emerging concept of cloud manufacturing. It has the potential to dramatically improve the feasibility and applicability of cloud manufacturing. Our focus is on the pricing strategies for service providers in bidding for jobs in such a system. A scenario is developed based on cloud additive manufacturing services. A game theoretic approach for pricing simulation is proposed in the research, and a fuzzy algorithm is employed in the pricing decision. Two pricing policies are considered: one is that the information of players is unknown to each other, and the other is that the information of players who are within a limit of Euclidean space is known to each other. The effects of system load and the weight coefficients in KNN recommendation algorithm are also studied. The results show that the pricing policy has significant effect on revenue generation for providers, and the increase of system load helps to grow revenue for providers only when the machine utilization is low and job waiting time is short. In addition, the system seems to be less sensitive to the change of KNN weights in terms of individual provider and system revenues.

AB Blockchain has the potential to significantly shape the way in which interpersonal and inter-organizational relations will be managed. Despite high expectations, the technology lacks real-world applications that go beyond cryptocurrencies and that convince with efficiency and effectiveness. The gap between visions and theory, on the one hand, and reality, on the other hand, triggered a debate on the future of blockchain and the role of IS research in shaping this future. However, researchers currently struggle to make meaningful quantitative analyses and predictions regarding where and how blockchain is efficiently and effectively applicable. One reason for this is conceptual fuzziness, to which this paper points out. The author identifies three issues, i.e., presence of (i.) terminological ambiguities, (ii.) concept proliferation and conceptual inconsistencies, and (iii.) technological determinism, which IS research needs to clarify if the discipline wants to make reliable predictions about compelling use cases of blockchain.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) appears to be a particularly attractive use case for blockchain. This research combines inductive in-depth interviews with the Delphi method to explore what potentials blockchain technology in AM creates, which adoption barriers firms need to overcome, and how supply chains will be affected by the integration of these two potentially disruptive technologies. The results suggest opportunities that are related to intellectual property (IP) rights management, the monitoring of printed parts throughout their lifecycle, process improvements, and data security. The most important barriers for blockchain adoption in AM are an absence of blockchain-skilled specialists on the labor market, missing governance mechanisms, and a lack of firm-internal technical expertise. By addressing important limitations of AM, blockchain is expected to improve the competitiveness of AM in parts' production, catalyzing the trend toward more decentralized manufacturing resulting in more agile, resilient, and flexible supply chains and reduced logistics costs. Beyond that, blockchain-based AM platforms are expected to enhance supply chain visibility, drive supply chain digitalization, support supply chain finance, and contribute to the emergence of shared factory systems.

AB In recent decades, newly emerging mobile applications and services are becoming increasingly resource hungry and computation intensive. Portable size mobile devices fall short in providing such services. Cloud computing has been a core computation technology to provide visualized resources in a scalable way for mobile services. However, the unpredictable network transmission latency makes cloud computing not efficient enough for time-sensitive mobile services, which requires major changes in underlying computing platform. Mobile edge computing is widely known as one of the novel technologies has emerged in recent years to address this issue. For being impractical to construct huge edge cloud in network edge, edge clouds can still be overloaded in rush time. Offloading to near-user facilities using device-to-device (D2D) or other technologies becomes an augmentation approach. However, how to manage the facilities/resources effectively become a new issue. In this paper, we proposed a resource management scheme named BCEdge based on blockchain in D2D-assisted mobile edge computing. BCEdge is a reliable scheme that operates in a distributed way to relieve the load of edge clouds. We illustrate the advantages and technical details of BCEdge using flow charts and interaction charts. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of our scheme. Finally, we discuss the possible future extensions.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blockchain technology on firms' operational efficiency in the context of China.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors use panel data for blockchain-based companies listed on stock exchanges in China (Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong) between 2014 and 2018. The operational efficiency of firms that deploy blockchain technology is evaluated using ordinary least squares and system generalized method of moments estimation.
   Findings
   Results suggest that companies' current year performance exceeds the previous year performance because of blockchain deployment in firms' operations. Firms with higher financial leverage and return on assets reap more benefits from blockchain. Larger and older firms benefit less from blockchain implementation. Stochastic frontier estimation suggests that, on average, firms attain a 57.76 per cent technical efficiency level, or, put differently, they operate 42.24 per cent below their maximum level of potential output.
   Originality/value
   Blockchain can benefit firms in terms of consensus, security and trust, spurring the evolution of a new form of organizational dynamics. This study explores the theory of transactional cost analysis under blockchain technology. In addition, this study hypothesizes and empirically demonstrates the significant impacts of blockchain technology on corporations' operational efficiency, using audited, externally reported financial data. Industry professionals can reap benefits from this research by noticing the magnitude of changes in firms' financial parameters attributable to blockchain adoption.

AB Blockchain and cryptocurrency are a hot topic in today's digital world. In this paper, we create a game theoretic model in continuous time. We consider a dynamic game model of the bitcoin market, where miners or players use mining systems to mine bitcoin by investing electricity into the mining system. Although this work is motivated by BTC, the work presented can be applicable to other mining systems similar to BTC. We propose three concepts of dynamic game theoretic solutions to the model: Social optimum, Nash equilibrium and myopic Nash equilibrium. Using the model that a player represents a single "miner" or a "mining pool", we develop novel and interesting results for the cryptocurrency world.

TI Jointgraph: A DAG-based efficient consensus algorithm for consortium
   blockchains
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE

AB The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions and operations in a shared manner. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin realize decentralization at the cost of mining overhead, which is not suitable for real-life scenarios requiring high throughput. Techniques such as the consortium blockchain improve efficiency through partial decentralization. However, the consensus algorithms used in the existing state-of-the-art consortium blockchains face many challenges when dealing with commercial applications. For example, the high communication overhead hinders the scalability of PBFT-based consensus algorithms even though they are efficient at small scale. Hashgraph, one of the most popular Directed Acyclic Graph-based (DAG-based) consensus algorithms, achieves good performance in scalability; however, it does not allow users' dynamic participation. To deal with these challenges, we propose Jointgraph, a Byzantine fault-tolerance consensus algorithm for consortium blockchains based on DAG. In Jointgraph, transactions are packed into events and validated by no less than 2/3 of all members. A supervisor is introduced in our design, who monitors member behaviors and improves consensus efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that Jointgraph outperforms Hashgraph in both throughput and latency.

AB With the development of intelligent vehicles, the research on road condition monitoring has attracted much attention in the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The combination of VANET, cloud computing, and fog computing provides on-demand computational resources while creating a lot of new challenges. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving cloud-fog-based traceable road surface condition monitoring scheme. We use certificateless aggregate signcryption technology to implement multiple messages aggregation verification, which greatly saves computing resources and bandwidth. Moreover, we also use a traceable vehicle pseudo identity generated by a trace authority (TRA) to achieve identity privacy protection. To ensure the privacy of the fog and cloud server, the road condition information is reported in ciphertext format. In addition, the cloud server can perform ciphertext equivalence test operation to distinguish different road condition information of the same area without compromising the confidentiality. The ciphertext, which exceeds the set threshold, is uploaded to the blockchain. It can be stored permanently and never be tampered with or deleted. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness of the proposed scheme and show that the proposed scheme has higher efficiency.

AB There is a rapidly growing interest in health care due to the recent development of IT convergence technologies according to the 4th industrial revolution. More services for personal health management of users are available and studies on the establishment of knowledge base for an efficient health log data management in the health care field are being carried out with the emergence of block chain technology which is the next generation information security technology. In this paper, a knowledge-based block chain network for health log data management mobile service is suggested. The user's log data and context information are applied to block chain technology that is difficult to forge and falsify in the knowledge-based health platform, enabling a large amount of users' log data and context information accumulated continuously to be stored in a block in the knowledge base using the side chain structure that stores information through the configuration of knowledge-based data transaction. This enables high expandability and security to be secured in mobile environment as well. The result of comparative evaluation with the existing ontology knowledge model for verifying the validity shows that the suggested method presented approximately 16.5% higher performance in accuracy and reproducibility.

AB The used car market is characterized by information asymmetries and mistrust. Blockchain technology promises to resolve these problems using a system which stores data over the life cycle of a vehicle. However, while blockchain technology is strong in preserving the stored information, sense-making of this information is still essential to bring value to end consumers of the system. In this paper, we take an exploratory approach and create a prototype, which is then evaluated in realistic car sale conversations between buyers and sellers. We demonstrate and discuss how the interplay of different design elements of an application, built on top of a blockchain-based platform, helps to reduce information asymmetries and enhance trust. Our findings suggest that though providing more information about a used product (a car) leads to fewer information asymmetries in general, a reputation mechanism and data analysis are both beneficial in improving the situation further. As for trust, such a system enhances trust between buyers and sellers and, in general, makes the overall purchase process more trustworthy. However, to achieve these positive effects, the quality of the stored information should be guaranteed and properly communicated to the end-user.

AB Healthcare data is important in making critical policy decisions, patients care, and medical diagnostics to name a few. Due to the importance and market demand, healthcare data is also vulnerable to cyber attacks. The centralized record keeping systems expose a single node for the attackers to attack. A decentralized system is computationally expensive but has the ability to be revolutionary by keeping the patient at the core and providing security, transparency, privacy, and interoperability of the electronic healthcare data. A blockchain is such an implementation of a distributed and decentralized system using reliable cryptographic algorithms. This paper proposes a secure blockchain based architecture tailored specifically to cater to the needs of e-healthcare systems.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm branded by heterogeneous technologies composed of smart ubiquitous objects that are seamlessly connected to the Internet. These objects are often deployed in open environments to provide innovative services in various application domains such as smart cities, smart health, and smart communities. These IoT devices produce a massive amount of confidentiality and security-sensitive data. Thus, security of these devices is very important in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the system. In this paper, a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism is proposed for lightweight IoT devices and is applicable to a large number of scenarios. The mechanism is based on the technology of the fog computing and the concept of the public blockchain. The results gained from the experiments demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed mechanism when compared to a state-of-the-art blockchain-based authentication technique.

AB Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture separates control plane and data plane, making network flexible and programmable. Since the large number of devices connected to the Internet of things (IoT) networks, the SDN-based network architecture makes the deployment and configuration of IoT much easier. In the IoT network, the fine-grained network traffic is critical to network management, then we propose a novel scheme to measure the fine-grained network traffic in the SDN-based IoT networks. In SDN-based IoT networks, the controller is very easy to be attacked, we introduce the blockchain technology into the measurement framework to ensure the security and consistency of the statistics. To measure flow traffic with low overhead and high accuracy, we collect the statistics of coarse-grained traffic of flows and fine-grained traffic of links, and model the network traffic as an ARIMA model and forecast the network traffic with the coarse-grained measurement of flows. Then, we propose an objective function to decrease the estimation errors. Due to the objective function is an NP-hard problem, we present a heuristic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of the fine-grained measurement. Finally, we conduct some simulations to verify the validity of the proposed measurement scheme. Simulation results show that our approach is feasible and effective.

AB The properties of a blockchain such as immutability, provenance, and peer-executed smart contracts could bring a new level of security, trust, and transparency to e-learning. In this paper, we introduce our proof-of-concept blockchain-based e-learning platform developed to increase transparency in assessments and facilitate curriculum personalisation in a higher education context. Most notably, our platform could automate assessments and issue credentials. We designed it to be pedagogically neutral and content-neutral in order to showcase the benefits of a blockchain back-end to end users such as students and teaching staff. Our evaluation suggests that our platform could increase trust in online education providers, assessment procedures, education history and credentials.

AB The digitalization of healthcare systems is no longer a trend but a reality, which is driven by the rapid developments in the fields of medicine, information and communication technology (ICT). It revolutionizes the practice of medicine by making innovative treatment forms possible by the accelerated exchange of patient data. In this way it brings tremendous advantages to all stakeholders in healthcare delivery. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity, the decreasing number of physicians, long distances and poor road infrastructure between doctors and patients create loopholes in the delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural regions, which can at least partially be filled by the use of telemedicine. The acceptance of ehealth is the most important success factor in its use for the management of patients. User-friendliness, efficiency, effectiveness, legal safety and reimbursement of telemedical services are the important conditions for this. Furthermore, training and continuing training of healthcare personnel also drive the development of telemedicine. Factors delaying the use of telemedicine are partial lack of reimbursement and lack of interoperability among different systems of medical technology. Pilot projects serve to provide evidence for the usefulness and effectiveness of telemedicine. They also help to build the structural foundation on which telemedicine can develop. Examples of such projects are emergency triage, online video consultations and digital care projects. There are many emerging trends in the field of digital health, which are developing at different paces. Examples of such trends are artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and augmented reality.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to strive to close the current research gap pertaining to potential implications of the blockchain (BC) for sustainable business models (SBMs) in the agri-food industry. Design/methodology/approach To answer the research question, the authors utilised the Value Triangle framework by Biloslavo et al. (2018) in order to explore the potential innovation of BC for SBMs in the agri-food industry. Then, the authors apply it to an in-depth exploratory case study of the Placido Volpone winery. The authors draw data from strategic plans, annual reports, corporate website and a semi-structured interview with the winery's founder. Findings The authors show how BC technology could be a source of SBM innovation in the agri-food industry.
   Originality/value The paper is novel because it investigates the relationship between SBM innovation and BC providing theoretical justification to SBM technological innovation in an agri-food setting. Additionally, the paper provides an empirical application of the framework by Biloslavo et al. (2018) for understanding the development of SBM through BC in the agri-food industry.

AB Purpose
   The short lifespan of digital signatures presents a challenge to the long-term preservation of digitally signed records. It can undermine attempts to presume, verify or assess their authenticity. This paper aims to investigate the challenges of the expiration of digital signatures in the context of digital archiving.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper identifies requirements for the long-term preservation of digitally signed records and compares them with the existing approaches. The characteristics, operational procedures and requirements of the technologies used for digital signatures are combined with the archival requirements to design a new model.
   Findings
   The paper proposes a new model of a blockchain-based system, which can be combined with any digital archive to assist the process of long-term preservation of digitally signed records.
   Originality/value
   The proposed TrustChain 2.0 model is based on previous research conducted as part of the InterPARES Trust project. It builds on TrustChain 1.0 by including digital signature certificate chain validity information in a blockchain thus avoiding the issues concerning records confidentiality and privacy information disclosure. The paper contributes not only to the development of archival science but also shows archival institutions on how to approach long-term preservation of digitally signed records.

AB Sharing trusted data among trusted stakeholders is very important to large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the entities and organizations involved in IoT naturally lack trusted relationships, which poses significant challenges to the above vision. Specifically, the first challenge is to ensure that the data in the physical world can be objectively and truly injected into the information world of IoT. The second is to ensure the credibility of the entities' identities in IoT. The third is to ensure the authenticity of data, the credibility of identity, and the reliable transmission of data when a third trusted party is unable to provide the expected trusted services. In view of the above challenges, this paper proposes a secure and lightweight triple-trusting architecture (SLTA), which fully uses a blockchain-related supporting technology. The architecture includes an oracle-based data collection mechanism, which ensures that the data collected from edge devices of IoT cannot be modified, and the distributed identity management mechanism, which enhances personal privacy, security, and control of digital identities. Furthermore, a series of innovative designs for applying the blockchain to special large-scale cooperation scenario in IoT are proposed, which is also a part of the key mechanisms of the SLTA. The innovative design includes a new software-defined blockchain structure model and a lightweight Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm that provides credible support for decentralized data collection, identity management, and data transfer, as well as low-overhead sequential storage mechanism.

AB This paper lies at the intersection of scholarly literatures on forced migration, politically engaged diasporas, and the use of online platforms and digital technologies for political ends. It follows the efforts of a group of Rohingya diasporic activists using a variety of means, online and offline, to contest the claims and authority of Myanmar, an established territorial state. Their actions can be subsumed into two kinds of politics, a politics of confrontation and a politics of recognition. Taken together, these actions lead to an emergent political formation, a reterritorialised, dispersed, and virtual national community that seeks to mimic some state functions without explicitly calling for self-determination or an independent nation-state. This paper follows four activist projects: YouTube-based Rohingya TV, the effort to join the ConIFA alternative World Football Cup tournament, the campaign to have the Rohingya script recognized by the Unicode Consortium, and the effort to build a database for undocumented Rohingyas using blockchain. This complex of social, political, electronic, and virtual relations is situated against a 20th century political imaginary built around the homeland-people-language trinity, dialectically producing an immanent contradiction.

AB This study is the first to provide systematic evidence regarding investor behaviour in initial coin offerings (ICOs), their investment patterns and their role in the success of campaigns. Using hand-collected data on 472 public token sales over the period of 2013-2017, we advance the ICO literature by demonstrating that some contributors often invest in more than one campaign, and such serial investors contribute earlier. However, they are not more informed and fail to pick better-quality ICOs. Only large serial investors invest more in campaigns that raise more funds, attract more contributors, are more likely to reach their hard caps, and distribute tokens that are listed on crypto exchange. Our findings raise the question of whether regulatory or industry self-regulation agreements on information provision measures are needed to protect smaller retail ICO investors that exhibit naive reinforcement learning behaviour.

AB Purpose
   Understanding a technology's patent landscape, including patent strategies, helps organizations position themselves regarding their innovation and provides insight about a technology's future direction. This study aims to provide an overview of the blockchain technology patenting trends and outlines an exploratory framework of patenting strategies for blockchain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A total of 3,234 registered patents are analyzed to determine the geographical distribution and identify key actors patenting around the globe. In addition, an empirical study consisting of multiple case studies in the form of ten in-depth interviews with owners/managers of organizations based in North America was conducted to understand organizations' strategies for patenting the blockchain technology.
   Findings
   Several novel insights regarding the strategies are used for blockchain technology patenting. For example, the existence of strong anti-patent sentiment which results in a lack of patenting by start-up organizations or has led to a form of open source patenting strategy. Larger organizations appear to be patenting defensively, and small to medium organizations are primarily patenting to defend their competitive advantage.
   Practical implications
   Start-up organizations harboring anti-patent sentiment should consider the open-source patenting strategy to ensure that the collaborative innovation network can continue. They should also consider collaborating with other actors within the network to have a competitive position in the market.
   Originality/value
   To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to conduct an empirical study with organizations currently using the blockchain technology to understand patenting strategies used for blockchain.

AB Critical pedagogy is in crisis. To address this crisis, this paper reinvents Paulo Freire's concept of utopia in and for our age of the Anthropocene. Understood as a system, postdigital critical utopia provides us with normative foundations and returns agency from invisible data and algorithms to human beings. Understood as a process, postdigital critical utopia unmasks the myth of neutrality and adds an important element of myth, religion, ritual, and faith. Understood as an orientation, postdigital critical utopia needs to be balanced by dystopia, integrate environmental considerations, and act with a combination of epistemical curiosity and hope. Theoretical and practical attempts at introducing advanced technology to reimagine new utopias now take place in media theory, hacking, activism, and small pockets of the academia. To transcend its own crisis and remain relevant, contemporary critical pedagogy movement must urgently join these attempts. However, catching up with technological development is only the tip of a much larger iceberg. In order to take the lead in processes of modernization, critical pedagogy movement needs to actively develop utopian visions and techno-administrative systems which may support these visions.

AB The widespread application of the Hyperledger Fabric platform and the timeliness requirement of transactions on the platform necessitate the effective performance evaluation of transaction processing. The existing evaluation researches on Hyperledger Fabric ignored transaction endorsement failure (due to transaction endorsing duration timeout) and/or ignored block timeout. This paper considers these two timeout constraints and develops a hierarchical model for Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 transaction process from the time when transactions are submitted by clients until the completion of validating/committing transactions as a block. Formulas for calculating performance measures, including platform throughput, transaction rejection probability and mean transaction response delay, are derived. Extensive numerical analysis and simulations are carried out to verify the approximate accuracy of the model and formulas. Moreover, numerical analysis is applied to illustrate the impact of various parameters on performance measures.

TI Adoption of Blockchain Technology in the Australian Grains Trade: An
   Assessment of Potential Economic Effects
SO ECONOMIC PAPERS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Australia; Blockchain; general equilibrium modelling; grains trade;
   productivity
AB Recent analysis of Blockchain use has highlighted considerable potential productivity gains arising from lower transaction costs between buyers and sellers of goods. This has been shown by recent examples of Blockchain use in the Australian grains sector. In this paper, we have further developed and quantified this concept of productivity gain by undertaking several illustrative scenarios using a general equilibrium model of the global economy. Our analysis indicates that an assumed modest growth (five per cent) in productivity due to Blockchain use in the grains sector could raise output by eight per cent over the medium term. If this is accompanied by Blockchain use in the Australian finance sector, grains output could reach ten per cent. This reflects the effect of reduction in transaction costs due to the use of Blockchain technology as a "distributed ledger technology" in grain trading. Further, it is anticipated that the wider effects of Blockchain-driven productivity enhancement of the Australian finance sector could contribute to approximately 2.5 per cent increase in GDP in the medium term, relative to what would otherwise be.

TI Bitcoin's dynamic peer-to-peer topology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Topology discovery is a prerequisite when investigating the network properties; with the enormous number of Bitcoin users and performance issues, it becomes critical to analyse the network in a fashion that makes it possible to detect all Bitcoin's nodes and understand their behaviour. In massive, dynamic, and distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks like Bitcoin, where thousands of updates occur per second, it is hard to obtain an accurate topology representing the structure of the network as a graph with nodes and links by using the traditional local measurement approaches based on batches, offline data, or on the discovery of the topology around a small set of nodes and then combine them to discover an approximate network topology. All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system that performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links, which assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing. The topology discovery system allows us to gain knowledge on the Bitcoin network size, the network stability in terms of reachable, churn, and well-connected nodes, as well as some data regarding the effects of some countries' Internet infrastructure on Bitcoin traffic.

AB Certificateless authenticated key agreement (CLAKA) is important to prevent the escrow problem. It also mitigates the certificate management burden in storage and during the message exchange. However, many previously designed CLAKA protocols were designed in the centralized system architectures that may cause the single point of failure. A new CLAKA is designed in a decentralized (blockchain) architecture that is very suitable for wireless body area networks (WBANs). The proposed protocol is secure as long as it computes a common session key between WBAN user and blockchain nodes. An ID-based blind signature with message recovery is used between blockchain nodes. The blind signature with message recovery is used to achieve authentication and anonymity by acquiring a signature without disclosing the message. It also has advantage in minimizing the size of signature and it is efficient in a situation of limited bandwidth. The protocol analysis shows that it is secure and can resist many WBAN security attacks compared to the existing authenticated key agreement protocols.

AB Blockchain technology and the circular economy (CE) are two emergent concepts that can change the way we live for decades. Arrival of Industry 4.0 is set to transform organisational activities through various technological innovations. Blockchain is such a critical technology. Yet, the breadth of the blockchain concept and its application require nuanced investigation in different contexts, including examining some tensions with the applications. This paper examines how blockchain technology is likely to transform and advance circular economy realisation. Using grounded theory building from multiple case studies, we present early evidence linking the blockchain application to circular economy dimensions of regenerate, share, optimise, loop, virtualise, and exchange (ReSOLVE model). Case studies of blockchain application in various industrial sectors, at different adoption levels, for diverse organisational purposes are analysed and discussed. We systematically examine the practices, gaps, potential tensions, and critical reflections. Our study concludes with a summary of research propositions, limitations, and future research directions.

TI TraceChain: A blockchain-based scheme to protect data confidentiality
   and traceability
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE ABE; cloud computing; confidentiality; data sharing
AB The risk of sharing data in cloud computing has gathered increasing attention. After the owner of some confidential data outsources the data to cloud storage services and shares it with others, the data owner lost the control to the data to a large extent. To achieve data sharing while keeping data confidentiality, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed by cloud storage services. However, ABE can only guarantee that outsourced data on the cloud is decrypted by attribute-satisfying users but cannot restrict data from being accessed by dishonest users whose attributes also satisfy the access-control policy. It is impossible for the data owner to control the shared data after it has been decrypted by dishonest users, especially when a set of attribute-satisfying dishonest users may collude. To address this concern, we propose a traceable data sharing scheme called TraceChain. In TraceChain, data is encrypted over a new CP-ABE scheme called E-CP-ABE. Furthermore, the system parameters for generating the private key in E-CP-ABE are uploaded to the private blockchain and transactions are performed on the chain. The data owner can obtain the identity of users by monitoring system parameters simultaneously and control data sharing on the blockchain. To prove the security of our scheme, the security analysis is given in this paper. Meanwhile, experimental results also show that our system is viable and efficient.

AB As an important branch of the Internet of Things (IoT), Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have attracted wide attention from industrial and academic. Due to an opening wireless channel, the security and efficiency of VANETs have also become serious. To enhance the security and efficiency, various batch verification schemes have been proposed. However, most of those schemes suffer from the complicated certificate management problem or different kinds of attacks. Also,the bilinear pairing which is intractable for lightweight devices in VANETs usually be used inthose schemes. To solve the above problems, we propose an efficient blockchain-based batch verification scheme for VANETs using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). We also provide security analysis to show its ability to resist current known attacks. Besides, we have implemented corresponding blockchain system and the performance analysis shows that it is suitable for VANETs.

AB Blockchain is a new technology slowly integrating our economy with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and many more applications. Bitcoin and other versions of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new types of assets are characterized by wild swings in prices, and this can lead to large swings in profit and losses. To respond to these dynamics, cryptoinvestors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of portfolio selection and optimization. Bitcoin returns have shown some form of regime change, suggesting that regime-switching models could more adequately capture the volatility dynamics. This paper presents a two-state Markov-switching COGARCHR-vine (MSCOGARCH) model for cryptocurrency portfolio selection and compares the performance to the single-regime COGARCH-R-vine (COGARCH). The findings here are in line with the literature where MSCOGARCH outperforms the single-regime COGARCH with regard to the expected shortfall risk. The COGARCH specifications here capture the structural breaks and heavy tailness within each state of the Markov switching in order to achieve a minimal risk and a maximum return. The flexibility of R-vine copula allows adequate bivariate copula selection for each pair of cryptocurrencies to achieve suitable dependence structure through pair-copula construction architecture.

AB In the past years numerous scandals in hiring processes of public institutions revealed significant weaknesses of the existing process. This lead to a lose of trust of citizens and applicants in these processes. Besides that, even honest processes often lack transparency for applicants, the company and, in the case of public institutions, also for citizens. Distributed ledger technology has been used in numerous past projects to establish trust between entities. Especially smart contracts have been a useful tool to execute programs in this setting. Thus, in the context of this project we developed an approach based on smart contracts to decentralize this process and improve its transparency and reliability. We enhance the system with game theory mechanics to encourage reviewers and candidates to participate honestly, further increasing the likelihood of a fair selection process. Nonetheless, not all blockchains support smart contracts and their usage comes with an elevated additional monetary cost. Due to that, in the blockchain environment, many businesses only emulate smart contracts by executing them on external servers which improves the scalability but decreases the decentralization. In the context of this, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of emulating smart contracts compared to native smart contracts in our concrete usage example. Our approach, compared to existing solutions, can be employed on any distributed ledger which allows to store some sort of metadata on the chain resulting in a significantly lower creation and maintenance cost (up to 30 times cheaper). The developed solution and discussion gives useful insight into safety and cost considerations which have to be made when deciding between native and emulated smart contracts.

AB This paper presents a blockchain-based architecture for our current electronic health record (EHR) systems. Being built on top of existing databases maintained by health providers, the architecture implements a blockchain solution to ensure the integrity of data records and improve interoperability of the systems through tracking all events that happen to the data in the databases. In this proposed architecture, we also introduce a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks on the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions; hence, it potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against data misuse.

AB This research studies the risk decision-making (RDM) problem faced by participants in a spacecraft supply chain, considering the adoption of the blockchain technology to facilitate information sharing. We investigate a three-level spacecraft supply chain composed of a spacecraft builder, supplier, and logistics service integrator with the Stackelberg game under the scenarios of decentralized, partially centralized, and fully centralized decision-making. For each scenario, we show how the spacecraft builder?s optimal order quantity and the supplier?s application degree of the blockchain technology change with the spacecraft builder?s risk coefficient. We also compare the overall profit of the supply chain for three decision-making scenarios.

AB An electronic business transaction among untrusted bodies without consulting a mutually trusted party has remained widely accepted problem. Blockchain resolves this problem by introducing peer-to-peer network with a consensus algorithm and trusted ledger. Blockchain originally introduced for cryptocurrency that came with proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Due to some performance issues, scientists brought concept of permissioned Blockchain. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned Blockchain targeting business-oriented problems for industry. It is designed for efficient transaction execution over Blockchain with pluggable consensus model; however, there is limitation of rapid application development. Hyperledger introduced a new layer called Hyperledger Composer on top of the Fabric layer, which provides an abstract layer to model the business application readily and quickly. Composer provides a smart contract to extend the functionality and flexibility of Fabric layer and provides a way of communication with other systems to meet business requirements. Hyperledger Composer uses role-based access control (RBAC) model to secure access to its valuable assets. However, RBAC is not enough because many business deals require continuous assets monitoring. Our proposed model, BlockU, covers all possible access control models required by a business. BlockU can monitor assets continuously during transactions and updates attributes accordingly. Moreover, we incorporate hooks in Hyperledger Composer to implement extended permission model that provides extensive permission management capability on an asset. Subsequently, our proposed enhanced access control model is implemented with a minimal change to existing Composer code base and is backward compatible with the current security mechanism.

AB This paper describes a decentralized low-cost system designed to reinforce personal security in big events in case of emergency. The proposal consists of using smart contracts supported by blockchain in the management of events. An alternative communication channel that does not require any cloud service is also provided with the aim of improving the coordination of emergency services. Peers may use this emergency support tool to interact with each other through a chat when additional support is required. Since information security is mandatory in this scenario, identity-based signcryption schemes are here used to guarantee communication confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity. Depending on the communication mode (peer-to-peer or broadcast), different signcryption methods are used. A first implementation of the proposal has produced promising results.

AB Energy-efficient computing is especially important in the field of high-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers. Therefore, automated optimization of energy efficiency during the execution of a compute-intensive program is desirable. In this article, a framework for the automatic improvement of the energy efficiency on NVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing units) using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling is presented. As application, the mining of crypto-currencies is used, since in this area energy efficiency is of particular importance. The framework first determines the energy-optimal frequencies for each available currency on each GPU of a computer automatically. Then, the mining is started, and during a monitoring phase it is ensured that always the most profitable currency is mined on each GPU, using optimal frequencies. Tests with different GPUs show that the energy efficiency, depending on the GPU and the currency, can be increased by up to 84% compared to the usage of the default frequencies. This in turn almost doubles the mining profit.

AB Blockchain is a very promising technology that spans many use cases other than cryptocurrencies. For example, its implementation in the Internet of Things (IoT) based networks is still unclear and demands further research. This is mainly due to the limited constraints of IoT devices and the ledger-based design of blockchain protocol. IoT may offer many benefits if blockchain features can be balanced to fit it. As such, many current problems in IoT can be resolved. However, implementing blockchain for IoT may still impose a variety of challenges. In this paper, we provide a recent literature review analysis on blockchain in IoT. In particular, we identify five key components along with their design considerations and challenges that should be considered while creating blockchain architecture for IoT. We also define gaps that hinder creating a secure blockchain framework for IoT. We simulated two different types of blockchain implementation and identified that device to device architecture has comparatively better throughput than gateway based implementations.

ID META-REGULATION
AB Purpose This paper aims to examine the risks associated with smart contracts, a disruptive financial technology (FinTech) innovation, and assesses how in the future they could threaten the integrity of the global financial system. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach is used to identify risk factors related to the use of new financial innovations, by examining how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contributed to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) which occurred during 2007 and 2008. Based on this analysis, the potential for similar concerns with smart contracts are evaluated, drawing on the failure of The DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, which involved the loss of over $60m of digital currency. Findings Extensive use of bilateral agreements, complexity and lack of standardization, lack of transparency, misuse and speed of contagion were factors that contributed to the GFC that could also become material concerns for smart contract technology as its adoption grows. These concerns, combined with other contextual factors, such as the risk of defects in smart contracts and cyberattacks, could lead to potential destabilization of the broader financial system. Originality/value This paper draws attention to the risks associated with the adoption of disruptive FinTech. It also suggests steps that regulators and other key stakeholders can take to help mitigate those risks.

AB Due to the rapid development of information technology, supply chain network is evolving, which involves a higher level of interdependence between organisations. Conventional production capability evaluation relies on centralised approaches with limited sharing of performance and evaluation data. Besides, traditional evaluation methods are mainly based on subjective manual operation using limited data. In this paper, we propose a production capability evaluation system by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and blockchain technology for supply chain network. It contributes to achieving real-time data collection and automated enterprise production capability evaluation mechanism. Besides, blockchain technology is adopted to enable open and decentralised data storage and sharing, provide fair and automatic trading of data. The proposed system is evaluated through a simulation experiment. It demonstrated how to utilise the proposed system to choose suitable upstream enterprises. The successful development of the system could help to enhance production efficiency, reduce risk and provide a reasonable and more sustainable production management in supply chain network.

DT Article; Early Access
AB We present an overview of hybrid Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), a proof-of-stake checkpointing protocol overlaid onto Ethereum's proof-of-work blockchain. We describe its core functionalities and reward scheme and explore its properties. Our findings indicate that Casper's implemented incentives mechanism ensures liveness, while providing safety guarantees that improve over standard proof-of-work protocols. On the basis of a minimal impact implementation of the protocol as a smart contract on the blockchain, we discuss additional issues related to parametrization, funding, throughput, and network overhead and detect potential limitations.

AB The use of blockchain technology has increased tremendously over the last decade. Blockchain continues to evolve and new features and capabilities are developed continuously. Although the use of the technology started in cryptocurrency (specifically, Bitcoin), it has expanded to other areas that can benefit from a shared, secure, ledger. This article investigates the potential impact of blockchain technology on the accounting profession. This article analyzes data security and privacy considerations, technology, adoption, and implementation considerations, and some considerations that relate specifically to accounting and auditing. We find that the unique needs of an accounting information system may not be a good match for blockchain as it currently exists. While we explain that blockchain may deliver many benefits, particularly in the areas of data reliability and the financial statement audit, we identify several factors, which raise significant questions about whether blockchain will ever be significantly integrated in the accounting function. Chief among those concerns is the scalability of the technology at an acceptable cost. While significant investment has and will be made for further development of blockchain business applications, it is our assessment that proponents of blockchain integration in accounting have not yet made the economic case for it. We also have significant concerns about whether blockchain technology can adequately address risks associated with data security and privacy. Addressing all these issues will be a minimum requirement for gaining widespread acceptance by firms and their accountants.

AB Difficulties in financing and low utilization of funds are main financial problems that plague the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. The key to solving this problem lies in opening up the social data circulation between enterprises. It is a good solution for enterprises with frequent data interactions to form groups. Using group loans, the borrowing enterprises could solve the funding difficulties and the loan enterprises could improve the utilization rate of funds. In this article, we construct a group loan system based on blockchain technology, which can promote the free flow of funds among enterprises in the group. We combine the blockchain with the trusted execution environment to realize the automatic determination of loan conditions and realize the automatic execution of smart contracts. We also use the linkable group signature technology to ensure the traceability of loan users while protecting the anonymity. In addition, we use homomorphic encryption technology to make the statement confidential and computable.

DE Vehicular networks; Pseudonym; PKI; Blockchain; Privacy; Security
AB Vehicular networks rely on public key infrastructure (PKI) to generate the long-term and short-term (pseudonyms) certified pair of keys. This allows vehicles to use these keys to sign and to encrypt their exchanged messages in order to authenticate the sender and to ensure the integrity of messages. Therefore, the use of pseudonyms is fundamental to safeguard the security, to satisfy the non-repudiation and to revoke misbehaving nodes. However, the current PKI infrastructure is centralized making it vulnerable and at risk of being single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based pseudonym management framework for vehicular networks that ensures the security and privacy while maintaining the functionality of the network. The security of the proposed solution was evaluated using attack tree method, and the results have shown an improved resiliency to attacks than the conventional vehicular PKI.

TI Blockchain-based access control for enterprise blockchain applications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID SIGNATURE
AB Access control is one of the fundamental security mechanisms of IT systems. Most existing access control schemes rely on a centralized party to manage and enforce access control policies. As blockchain technologies, especially permissioned networks, find more applicability beyond cryptocurrencies in enterprise solutions, it is expected that the security requirements will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an access control system that works in a decentralized environment without compromising the unique features of a blockchain. A straightforward method to support access control is to deploy a firewall in front of the enterprise blockchain application. However, this approach does not take advantage of the desirable features of blockchain. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel blockchain-based access control scheme, which keeps the decentralization feature for access control-related operations. The newly proposed system also provides the capability to protect user's privacy by leveraging ring signature. We implement a prototype of the scheme using Hyperledger Fabric and assess its performance to show that it is practical for real-world applications.

AB Demand response (DR) in the smart grid will promote the stable operation of the power system and reduce economic costs effectively. However, uncertainty of users' behavior becomes a barrier of DR, in which the credibility between the DR users and aggregators will have a crucial impact on the DR. Blockchain is a new technology to solve the trust problem without third-party endorsement, which has the advantages of decentralization and irreversibility. Considering the difference of computing capability between users and aggregators, this article proposes a blockchain-based strategy to support the bidirectional selection between DR users and aggregators based on reputation values, which improves the success rate of the DR and mitigates the impact of user behavior on the DR. At the same time, this strategy can also increase the enthusiasm of users with a high reputation value to participate in DR. Using the network topology and DR incentive rules of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, the rationality of blockchain-based reliable interoperation for DR entities proposed in this paper is verified.

TI Weighted voting on the blockchain: Improving consensus in proof of stake
   protocols
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID RULES
AB Proof of stake (PoS) protocols rely on voting mechanisms to reach consensus on the current state. If an enhanced majority of staking nodes, also called validators, agree on a proposed block, then this block is appended to the blockchain. Yet these protocols remain vulnerable to faults caused by validators who abstain either accidentally or maliciously. To protect against such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate our results to the design of current PoS protocols.

TI Enforcing trustworthy cloud SLA with witnesses: A game theory-based

AB There lacks trust between the cloud customer and provider to enforce traditional cloud SLA (Service Level Agreement) where the blockchain technique seems a promising solution. However, current explorations still face challenges to prove that the off-chain SLO (Service Level Objective) violations really happen before recorded into the on-chain transactions. In this paper, a witness model is proposed implemented with smart contracts to solve this trust issue. The introduced role, "Witness", gains rewards as an incentive for performing the SLO violation report, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that the witness has to tell the truth, for maximizing the rewards. This fact that the witness has to be honest is analyzed and proved using the Nash Equilibrium principle of game theory. For ensuring the chosen witnesses are random and independent, an unbiased selection algorithm is proposed to avoid possible collusions. An auditing mechanism is also introduced to detect potential malicious witnesses. Specifically, we define three types of malicious behaviors and propose quantitative indicators to audit and detect these behaviors. Moreover, experimental studies based on Ethereum blockchain demonstrate the proposed model is feasible, and indicate that the performance, ie, transaction fee, of each interface follows the design expectations.

AB In the near future, manufacturing industries will be mostly recognised with characteristics like IoT, and massive data transactions. To fulfil these characteristics, paradigms like Cloud manufacturing, Industry 4.0 and smart factory have passed their preliminary steps to become the primary inspirations. Considering the nature of Cloud manufacturing which consists of a vast number of service providers and Service demanders being introduced to the manufacturing cloud, service composition problem is introduced. However, there is a big challenge for fulfilling the dynamic behaviour of parameters which change rapidly over time in the service composition problem. This paper challenges the centralised mechanism of service composition problem and introduces a novel platform entitled Blockchain-based service composition model (Block-SC) based on the Blockchain technology. Block-SC as a novel manufacturing architecture conquers the centralised mechanism by dividing the original service composition problem into multiple sub-problems each of which contains a small fraction of the service/task pool. The capabilities of the proposed platform are remarkable from two perspectives; first, it provides an effective mechanism for collaboration of service composition service providers with a service-oriented approach and from the second perspective, the optimality of service composition problem is profoundly affected considering the dynamic behaviour of Cloud manufacturing.

AB The second-hand automotive market is one with the least trust from consumers. Customers on the second-hand car market suffer from such problems as the car being in worse condition than initially indicated, accident damage that is not disclosed, fraud, etc. Akerlof, described the market for used cars as an example of the problem of information asymmetries and resulting quality uncertainty. In order to cope with quality uncertainties, used car buyers actively engage themselves in information seeking. Blockchain technology promises to automatize the tracking of cars through their lifecycles and provide reliable information at any point in time it is needed. In our study, we investigate the problems car buyers face during information seeking and propose requirements for the design of a blockchain-based system to address these.

AB Blockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology, is a disruptive and revolutionary technology that enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need for trusted central authorities. Many industries have taken steps to unleash the potential of blockchain technology, including the government sector, and early adopters are exploring the use of blockchain as one of the critical capabilities needed to create new business models and to radically transform government services and functions. However, despite this interest in adopting Blockchain technology, there is a lack of Blockchain frameworks or reference models/architecture that addresses government services in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain model that can be adopted by governments to establish government-led blockchain ecosystem for government services. The blockchain model is proposed based on the outcomes of our analysis of permissioned blockchain platform, and analysis of blockchain powered housing rentals use case that is being implemented by the Dubai Government. The proposed blockchain model outcomes includes a blockchain governance structure, participants and roles definition, and network architecture design which explains the deployment options and components. We also explain the model lifecycle and blockchain services, and we shed the light on the security and performance of the model. The study also includes exploring many blockchain use cases used by governments through proofs of concept or prototypes. Our analysis of Hyperledger Fabric design features shows the platform's relevance to government services and use cases. The Hyperledger Fabric analysis also identifies the platform's actors, services, processes and data structure of Hyperledger Fabric.

AB Ethereum is one of the currently popular trading platform, where any one can exchange, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies. Smart contract, a computer program, can help Ethereum to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. Because the smart contract usually handles large number of cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars apiece, its security has gained considerable attention. In this paper, we first investigate the security of smart contracts running on the Ethereum and introduce several new security vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to exploit and gain financial benefits. Then, we propose a more practical smart contract analysis tool termed NeuCheck, in which we introduce the syntax tree in the syntactical analyzer to complete the transformation from source code to intermediate representation, and then adopt the open source library working with XML to analyze such tree. We have built a prototype of NeuCheck for Ethereum and evaluate it with over 52 000 existing Ethereum smart contracts. The results show that (1) our new documented vulnerabilities are prevalent; (2) NeuCheck improves the analysis speed by at least 17.2 times compared to other popular analysis tools (eg, Securify and Mythril; and (3) allows for cross-platform deployment.

ID CONSENSUS
AB Selecting which blockchain participants can decide upon a new block is a difficult problem. Consortium blockchains need the participants to be predetermined while public blockchains incentivize all participants to waste their resources to decide every block. In this paper, we introduce the community blockchain that allows potentially all participants to decide upon "some" block while restricting the set of participants deciding upon "one" block. To this end, we propose a blockchain reconfiguration, a Byzantine consensus protocol that allows to dynamically change the set of blockchain participants deciding upon the upcoming blocks. The resulting blockchain, called ComChain, is resilience optimal and transitions through different configurations of participants recorded in dedicated blocks so that each configuration decides upon its subsequent transaction blocks. We evaluate an implementation that adds reconfiguration to the Red Belly Blockchain and demonstrates its practical performance in a distributed system.

AB Network intrusions are a big threat to network and system assets, which have become more complex to date. To enhance the detection performance, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) are adopted by many organizations to protect their resources. However, such detection systems or networks are typically vulnerable to insider attacks, so that there is a need to implement suitable trust mechanisms. In the literature, challenge-based trust mechanisms are able to measure the trustworthiness of a node by evaluating the relationship between the sent challenges and the received responses. In practice, challenge-based CIDNs have shown to be robust against common insider attacks, whereas it may still be susceptible to advanced insider attacks. How to enhance the robustness of such challenge-based CIDNs remains an issue. Motivated by the recent development of blockchains, in this work, our purpose is to design a blockchained challenge-based CIDN framework that aims to combine blockchains with challenge-based trust mechanism. Our evaluation demonstrates that blockchain technology has the potential to enhance the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs in the aspects of trust management (i.e., enhancing the detection of insider nodes) and alarm aggregation (i.e., identifying untruthful inputs) under adversary scenarios.

AB Blockchain is an immutable, encrypted, distributed ledger technology. While initially devised for and most commonly referenced with cryptocurrencies, there are an increasing number of applications outside finance, many of which are relevant to medical imaging. In this paper, the concepts and principles underlying the technology and applications relevant to medical imaging are discussed, in addition to potential challenges with implementations such as public versus private key access, distributed ledger size constraints, speed, complexity, and security pitfalls. Potential use cases for blockchain specifically relevant to medical imaging include image sharing including direct patient ownership of images, tracking of implanted medical devices, research, teleradiology, and artificial intelligence. While blockchain offers exciting ways to facilitate the storage and distribution of medical images, similar to the advent of picture archiving and communication systems decades ago, it does have several key limitations of which healthcare providers of medical imaging and imaging informatics professionals should be aware.

AB Purpose The main objective of this paper is to justify the implementation of blockchain (BC) over the traditional method deployed in the supply chain (SC) after using the fuzzy-analytic network process (fuzzy-ANP) application. Over the past two decades, the overall product cost is affected by the SC at a global level. Organizations are working on their existing SC for improving their performance. BC technology is a newly emerging technology and magnetizes the attention of researchers and industrialists. This technology is still at the initial stage, and only little investigation is available in the literature and it has not been much investigated by researchers. Design/methodology/approach Literature and expert opinion interpretation in BC characteristics are further analyzed and modeled using fuzzy-interpretive structural modeling (fuzzy-ISM), fuzzy-MICMAC and fuzzy-ANP. The combined approach of both fuzzy-ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC is applied to identify the common drivers to integrate the BC technology in the light of efficient supply chain management (SCM). Findings Comparative analysis between traditional and BC-based supply chain (BCSC) using fuzzy-ANP is carried out, considering the common driving characteristics. The proposed integrated (combined) approach of fuzzy-ISM, fuzzy-MICMAC and Fuzzy-ANP found that integration of BC with SCM is better prioritized than traditional supply chain management (TSCM). The findings in the article endorse that the TSCM can be made efficient by integrating the BC technology considering five most driving characteristics, namely, data safety and decentralization, accessibility, documentation, data management and quality. Originality/value The current proposed research work identifies 12 characteristics after studying numerous literature reviews and having a discussion with SC experts with knowledge of BC. The integrated approach of fuzzy-ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC is implemented here. After that, fuzzy-ANP is used to give ranking among BCSCM and TSCM. The study carried out in this article motivates industries to implement BC in their SC system. It will reduce the transaction cost, documentation work, save time and eliminate human error at the national and international levels. The common characteristics identified in this proposed work would help in managerial decisions for the adoption of BC to ensure that the system becomes more transparent, easily traceable and finally improve the performance.

AB We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries-cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals-and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies' capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Malaysia; Investment; Blockchain technology; Bitcoin cryptocurrency
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose
   This study aims to examine the factors that could increase the investment in the Bitcoin market among Malaysian Muslim communities.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study used a survey questionnaire to collect data for a sample of 200 Muslim respondents in Malaysia. Subsequently, the collected data was analysed using structural equation modelling, as well as basic descriptive statistics and one sample test.
   Findings
   The findings showed that compatibility, awareness and facilitating conditions have a significant impact on Malaysian Muslim communities' investment in the Bitcoin market.
   Originality/value
   It is worth emphasizing that this is one of the earliest studies that examine the Muslim communities' perception and willingness to invest in the Bitcoin market. Hence, it is expected to be one of the foundations for future studies in this area.

ID TASK-TECHNOLOGY FIT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; BUSINESS;
   ADOPTION; MODEL
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to explore the critical factors that affect users' acceptance and usage intention toward blockchain-based smart lockers.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research is designed in two phases. In the first phase, the key stakeholders are interviewed. Participants include managers from technology providers and logistics companies. In the second phase, a questionnaire survey is used to validate the proposed model.
   Findings
   Based on the final results, this study makes the following three suggestions. First, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are the critical factors. In other words, it is important to emphasize the function and convenience of a new service when introducing it to a potential user. Second, safety is not the major concern when using a blockchain-based smart locker. This means that users will trust the service provider for providing a secure service. Users do not worry about the security problem. Finally, the network externality of smart locker is also insignificant.
   Originality/value
   This study has three major contributions. First, this study identifies the critical factors that will affect user acceptance of blockchain-based smart lockers. Next, this study combines the opinions from service providers and users to understand the gap between different stakeholders. Finally, this study can enrich our understanding on the applications of blockchain from a managerial perspective and not only from a technical perspective, as in most previous studies.

AB Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular and attracted great interest in recent years. Beyond the financial sector, blockchain technologies are promising for addressing the current limitations in food supply chain management. As blockchain adoption for food supply chains is still in an early stage, it is significant to have a thematic framework to systematically understand the processes, benefits, and challenges. This paper aims to explore the adoption of blockchain technologies in food supply chains with a thematic analysis. Desktop research is conducted, and data is collected from online databases, including news article (e.g. Factiva) and research paper databases (e.g. Web of Science). Then we carry out a qualitative thematic analysis, according to the investigation processes suggested by Creswell. Based on the thematic analysis, we identify seven first-order themes and two second-order themes in adoption processes; thirteen first-order themes, sixteen second-order themes, and five third-order themes in benefits; and fourteen first-order themes and five second-order themes in challenges. In addition, we discuss and propose how to improve blockchain adoption in food supply chains in practice.

AB The insurance industry plays a key role in any modern economy. Blockchain technology promises to completely revolutionise the industry, with several bold claims made in terms of facilitating and speeding up claims settlements and improving fraud management. In this paper, we examine the factors that may influence the extent of blockchain proliferation and penetration within the insurance industry. We adopt the STEEP framework to analyse the key social, technological, environmental, economic and political/legal issues that may impact the insurance industry's openness or otherwise to blockchain, drawing on a diverse, multi-disciplinary literature. We supplement this with data drawn from 565 European respondents to a survey on blockchain use within the insurance industry. The results emphasise the need for the industry to properly understand and communicate how blockchain can be implemented across different insurance tasks in order to obtain a more tangible view of its benefits for staff, management and customers alike.

AB From its origins in virtual financial transactions, emerging initiatives are seeking to acquire a new identity for blockchain as capable of addressing anxieties over the capacity of digital media to permanently and accurately store information. In this article, we explore the ensuing mediation between blockchain enterprises and new professional communities to which they are catering. Drawing on thematic analysis, we analyze how this process is being carried out through the discursive construction of trust, leveraged rhetorically in academic, trade, and news publications to extend an application for financial transactions to cultural institutions. We describe how trust is used not only to mediate the introduction of an application that prioritizes decentralization and cryptography, but is the turf on which traditional institutions are staking a claim as the trustworthy managers of digital records through their use of blockchain. The concept of the archival imaginary-a vision of what archives and blockchain should be and mean that pivots on imagined needs and technological capacities based on the current information ecology, institutional control, and expert systems-offers a way to illuminate this process.

AB Edge computing (EC) emerges as a novel computing paradigm to offload computing tasks from user equipments (UEs) to edge notes (ENs) in fifth-generation networks, which definitely breaks the resource limitation of UEs to a certain degree. However, it is troublesome to guarantee the overall operating performance of ENs due to the uneven distributed resource demands of UEs, the resulting transmission delay and the data loss for computation offloading between the covered EN and the deployed destination EN. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based computation offloading method, named BCO, is proposed in this paper. Technically, since blockchain is a promising technique for the decentralized system, a blockchain-based EC framework is designed to degrade the data loss possibility by integrating blockchain and EC. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, the third version (NSGA-III), is leveraged to acquire the balanced offloading strategies. Furthermore, by taking advantage of Simple Additive Weighting and Multiple Criteria Decision Making, the optimal offloading strategy is identified. Finally, systematic experiments and analyses on the comparative experiment are conducted to verify the efficiency of our proposed method BCO.

DT Article; Early Access
AB Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we rearchitect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3000 to 20 000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.

AB Precision agriculture is based on the idea of utilizing technology to improve the efficiency of agriculture industry. Blockchain technology has great potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry. Furthermore, various Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are proposed to enhance production such as crops condition monitoring system. These technologies aim to address various stages of the agricultural supply chain by improving the processes. The key issue faced by farmers is to ensure the protection of their crops from animals during all stages of a harvest. This paper proposes a IoT-based prevention system to tackle this issue for safe farming. The solution is based on the input of the sensor nodes deployed in the field to detect animal attacks. These sensors report a hazard to a Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) in the field. The RNS produces human-safe ultrasonic sound waves that are unbearable for animals, thus they leave the field. The proposed RNS system also reports all hazard incidents to a centralized Farm Management System (FMS) maintained by the farmer. The paper also proposes a way the FMS can add value to a broader arena by becoming a service to an Agricultural Blockchain system. As a blockchain node, the FMS maintains a shared ledger as part of blockchain to share the details of incidents with meta information with other nodes in the blockchain. This information is vital for other blockchain nodes of the agricultural blockchain such as other FMS, companies, authorities and standard bodies. The low-cost RNS performance evaluation concludes that it is power efficient that makes it even affordable for developing countries, and as a Blockchain service it enables novel applications for the agriculture industry.

AB This paper examines the performance of cryptocurrencies issued in initial coin offerings (ICOs) over a three-year period after the initial exchange listing. Average (median) ICO underpricing amounts to 15% (3%), even though 4 out of 10 ICOs destroy value on the first trading day. Liquidity, market capitalization, and high-low price ratios predict returns. Long-run buy-and-hold returns are positive for the mean and negative for the median. For holding periods between one and twenty-four months, the median ICO depreciates by 30%. Evidently, there is substantial positive skewness in the cryptocurrency market. Further, a size effect emerges from the data as an empirical regularity: Large ICOs are more often overpriced and underperform in the long run.

AB A blockchain is resistant to modification based on the consensus of the network majority, which requires a large amount of communication among distributed nodes. Existing data dissemination protocol solves the wrong block problem also at a high communication cost. This paper investigates the error-correcting tamper-proofing data storage problem and proposes a three-layer framework to store the data in the blockchain to achieve data integrity. The data are stored as blocks, and we design a two-dimension chain data structure consisting of horizontal and vertical chains. This paper proposes a Rotating multiple random Masters and Error-Correcting data storage framework based on blockchain (RMEC) to strike a trade-off between system decentralization and the amount of communication. The proposed Rotating Multiple Random Sampling consensus mechanism (RMRS) randomly selects multiple temporary master nodes to handle each data access request so as to reduce the communication cost. We also propose two error-correcting mechanisms to validate and correct the wrong data blocks. Finally, we implement a prototype and conduct analyses on the system performance. The experiments demonstrate that the framework can achieve data tamper-proof and effectively reduce the communication cost.

AB Purpose Blockchain technology (BT) is setting world-shattering standard in all type of transactions in business. BT has the prospective to drastically transform supply chain (SC). The main challenge is to enhance trust among the SC stakeholders. This paper aims to identify and prioritize the factors and its challenges that influence the adoptability of BT in SC. The prioritization of these factors will be helpful to the practitioners to decide the strategy of implementing the BT in SC. Design/methodology/approach The factors influencing adoption of BT are identified from the review of literature and expert opinion is used to rank the factors influencing the adoptability of BT in SC using grey relational analysis (GRA). Findings We identified and prioritized key factors: inter-organizational trust and relational governance as organizational challenge, data transparency and data immutability as technological challenge, interoperability and product type as operational challenge and social influence and behavioral intention as social challenge that influences adoptability of BT in SC. Originality/value The priority of these factors will guide future researchers and industry practitioners to plan rational and financial strategy for implementing BT in SC.

AB Blockchain expansion is the high priority necessity to improve security. Hacking and other attacks are headway from system innovation and security measures for the cloud architecture. That is why the countermeasure deployed for such attacks should act in an opportune way and ought to be situated as close as possible to attacking device. As an example, DDoS attacks were not that complex as they are getting now with the new technology known as IoT. Imagine the consequences if 25 billion of IoT devices generate a huge amount of data for DDoS attacks. That is why we propose a new framework that can expand blockchain in a manner where more companies can share their resources to enhance security. So, we proposed a new and complete framework with cloud, fog, to secure configuration files with blockchain technology. Our framework considers the configuration files from SDN or NFV as an asset to secure with blockchain. By saving configuration files into blockchain, we can detect illegal changes occurred to configuration files after hacking attack. This study also focuses on expanding blockchain between the multiple service providers with ease to prevent waste of resources. This paper mainly provides opportunities for different could or companies to secure their assets by employing the power of blockchain and smart contracts.

AB Modern services of logistics has developed and expanded rapidly in China. The information of package delivery is managed by the logistics enterprises. Thus, while enjoying the modern services of logistics, consumers face the threats of personal privacy disclosure. In order to address such challenges in modern services of logistics, we present techniques to exploit blockchain to secure logistics for protecting personal privacy. The main contribution is that we propose alogistics blockchain model. We implement the logistics blockchain on the decentralised and distributed platform, which shows that it is efficient and secure.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to discuss the disrupting usage and impacts of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and advocate their role as enablers of sustainable tourism development goals.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Literature on blockchains and cryptocurrencies is critically synthesized, debated and expanded to identify and discuss their implications toward sustainable tourism futures.
   Findings
   As a distributive digital ledger, blockchains have the potential to create a more inclusive tourism future to address debates around tourism as a vehicle for sustainable development that alludes to value accruing to only certain providers and consumers. Blockchains and their cryptocurrencies (as a financial transaction capability) elevate trust and relational capabilities in an expedited and holistic manner, democratize participation in economic systems and re-distribute power and economic relations amongst actors by influencing the way data (the currency of the digital economy and the lifeblood of tourism) is collected, stored, exchange, owned and traded for co-creating value.
   Originality/value
   The paper contributes to the emerging but controversial literature about the trajectories between technology and sustainability by critically debating on how blockchains, through cryptocurrency economies, can be positioned to facilitate sustainable tourism futures.

AB The cloud network has the advantages in efficiently offloading the large-scale Internet traffic, which is considered as a promising architecture to provide the satisfactory multimedia services for mobile users. However, most current studies lack the joint consideration of economic and security of services in hybrid cloud networks. In this paper, a novel multimedia service optimization mechanism is proposed hereby to meet the user's requirements mentioned above while guaranteeing the reliability of service. Firstly, a credible scheme is designed to help the mobile users distinguish the reliable cloud providers. Meanwhile, a blockchain-based content credibility approach is further designed to guarantee the reliability and integrity of video contents. Moreover, a noncooperative Stackelberg game model is presented to maximize the profit of each party. Furthermore, the equilibrium of this game is achieved by the methods of backward induction and gradient descent. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution has efficient performance in terms of secure service ratio, utility, service pricing, etc.

AB Smart cities aim to provide smart governance with the emphasis on gaining high transparency and trust in public services and enabling citizen participation in decision making processes. This means on the one hand data generated from urban transactions need to be open and trustworthy. On the other hand, security and privacy of public data needs to be handled at different administrative and geographical levels. In this paper, we investigate the pivotal role of blockchain in providing privacy, self-verification, authentication, and authorization of participatory transactions in open governance. We also investigate up to what extent edge computing can contribute toward management of permissioned sharing at specific administrative levels and enhance privacy and provide an economic approach for resource utilization in a distributed environment. We introduce a novel architecture that is based on distributed hybrid ledger and edge computing model. The architecture provides refined and secure management of data generated and processed in different geographical and administrative units of a city. We implemented a proof of concept of the architecture and applied it on a carefully designed use case, ie, citizen participation in administrative decisions through consensus. This use case highlights the need to keep and process citizen participation data at local level by deploying district chaincodes and only share consensus results through permissioned chaincodes. The results reveal that proposed architecture is scalable and provide secure and privacy protected environment for citizen participatory applications. Our performance test results are promising and show that under control conditions, the average registration time for a citizen transaction is about 42 ms, whilst the validation and result compilation of 100 concurrent citizens' transactions took about 2.4 seconds.

AB With the increasing popularity of blockchain technologies in recent years, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps for short in this paper) have been rapidly developed and widely adopted in many areas, being a hot topic in both academia and industry. Despite of the importance of DApps, we still have quite little understanding of DApps along with its ecosystem. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of blockchain-based DApps to date, based on an extensive dataset of 995 Ethereum DApps and 29,846,075 transaction logs over them. We make a descriptive analysis of the popularity of DApps, summarize the patterns of how DApps use smart contracts to access the underlying blockchain, and explore the worth-addressing issues of deploying and operating DApps. Based on the findings, we propose some implications for DApp users to select proper DApps, for DApp developers to improve the efficiency of DApps, and for blockchain vendors to enhance the support of DApps.
