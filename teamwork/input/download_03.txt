AB As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of "block mining" by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.

AB Biometric technologies are routinely used in the response to refugee crises with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) aiming to have all refugee data from across the world in a central population registry by the end of 2019. The article analyzes biometrics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain as part of a technological assemblage, which I term the biometric assemblage. The article identifies five intersecting logics that explain wider transformations within the humanitarian sector and in turn shape the biometric assemblage. The acceleration of the rate of biometric registrations in the humanitarian sector between 2002 and 2019 reveals serious concerns regarding bias, data safeguards, data-sharing practices with states and commercial companies, experimentation with untested technologies among vulnerable people, and, finally, ethics. Technological convergence amplifies risks associated with each constituent technology of the biometric assemblage. The article finally argues that the biometric assemblage accentuates asymmetries between refugees and humanitarian agencies and ultimately entrenches inequalities in a global context.

ID CYBERSECURITY
AB Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.

AB The power sector is about to undergo a major disruptive transformation. In this paper, we have discussed the best possible energy solution for addressing the challenges of climate change and eradication of energy poverty. This paper focusses on the decentralized power generation, storage and distribution through photovoltaics and lithium batteries. It encompasses the need for local direct current (DC) power through the factors driving this change. The importance of local DC power in the transportation sector is also established. Finally, we conclude with data bolstering our argument towards the paradigm shift in the power network.

AB IoT network generates a large amount of data. This means that the monitoring and control of these networks and the transfer of packets from the IoT network to the server can cause communications to collapse. On the other hand, due to the large volume of data stored in the databases the monitoring of the IoT network needs very powerful servers to have a high degree of efficiency. This paper presents a novel adaptive closed-loop control system and speed up searches model to improve the monitor and control efficiency in IoT networks, specially those which are based in blockchain. The non linear control model under consideration includes a new way to evaluate the optimal number of blocks that should be at the queue of the miners' network in order to make the process efficient through the use of queuing theory. Also, a new system to speed up searches is presented by using hashmaps, which makes the monitoring process faster, reliable and efficient. The efficiency of the presented approach is illustrated by a numerical case study.

AB Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains have limitations in throughput, time consumption, and energy efficiency. In these systems, a miner will consume significant time and resources to obtain a reward for contributing to the blockchain. To overcome these limitations, recent research on blockchains are focused on accelerating the speed, scalability, and enhancing the security level. By enhancing specific procedures of blockchain system, the level of data integrity supported by the blockchain can become more robust, and efficient. In this paper, a new blockchain consensus model based on the Bryllite Consensus Protocol (BCP) is proposed to support a hyper-connected massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) ecosystem. The BCP scheme enables users to participate directly in new consensus processes through a Proof of Participation (PoP) algorithm. In this model, the consensus algorithm has a simpler form while maintaining high security level. In addition, because the BCP scheme gives users an equal chance to make a contribution to the blockchain, rewards are distributed in an equal fashion, which motivates user participation. The analysis of the proposed scheme is applied to the Bryllite consortium blockchain system (homed in Hong Kong), which is a new blockchain network developed for international game industries, gamers, and game events.

AB Background: Blockchain has the potential to disrupt the current modes of patient data access, accumulation, contribution, exchange, and control. Using interoperability standards, smart contracts, and cryptographic identities, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike.
   Objective: This work presents HealthChain, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement, data curation, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable, smart contracts, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security.
   Methods: The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care, namely, information security, interoperability, data integrity, identity validation, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records.
   Results: The results indicate several clear high-performing, low-bandwidth configurations, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models, one's anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific, Advanced Encryption Standard-encrypted data with static keys, incremental server storage, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys, incremental server storage, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations.
   Conclusions: Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information. By integrating a structured, interoperable design with patient-accumulated and generated data shared through smart contracts into a universally accessible blockchain, HealthChain presents patients and providers with access to consistent and comprehensive medical records. Challenges addressed include data security, interoperability, block storage, and patient-administered data access, with several configurations emerging for further consideration regarding speed and security.

AB Academics and practitioners have long acknowledged the importance of agile manufacturing and related supply chains in achieving firm sustainable competitiveness. However, limited, if any, research has focused on the evolution of practices within agile manufacturing supply chains and how these are related to competitive performance objectives. To address this gap, we reviewed the literature on an agile manufacturing drawing on the evolution of manufacturing agility, attributes of agile manufacturing, the drivers of agile manufacturing, and the identification of the enabling competencies deployable for agile manufacturing. Our thesis is that agile manufacturing is at the centre of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage, especially in light of current unprecedented market instability coupled with complex customer requirements. In this regard, the emphasis which agile manufacturing places on responsive adaptability would counter the destabilising influence of competitive pressures on organisations performance criteria. We have identified five enabling competencies as the agility enablers and practices of agile manufacturing, that is, transparent customisation, agile supply chains, intelligent automation, total employee empowerment and technology integration, and further explored their joint deployment to create positive multiplier effects. Future research directions were also provided with respect to the operationalisation of the five identified enablers and the potential for emergent technologies of big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things to shape future agile manufacturing practices.

TI NeuCheck: A more practical Ethereum smart contract security analysis

AB Ethereum is one of the currently popular trading platform, where any one can exchange, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies. Smart contract, a computer program, can help Ethereum to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. Because the smart contract usually handles large number of cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars apiece, its security has gained considerable attention. In this paper, we first investigate the security of smart contracts running on the Ethereum and introduce several new security vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to exploit and gain financial benefits. Then, we propose a more practical smart contract analysis tool termed NeuCheck, in which we introduce the syntax tree in the syntactical analyzer to complete the transformation from source code to intermediate representation, and then adopt the open source library working with XML to analyze such tree. We have built a prototype of NeuCheck for Ethereum and evaluate it with over 52 000 existing Ethereum smart contracts. The results show that (1) our new documented vulnerabilities are prevalent; (2) NeuCheck improves the analysis speed by at least 17.2 times compared to other popular analysis tools (eg, Securify and Mythril; and (3) allows for cross-platform deployment.

AB With the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), numerous practitioners and researchers have proclaimed its beneficial impact on supply chain transactions in the future. However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains.

TI BArt: Trading digital contents through digital assets
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
LA English

DE Bitcoin; blockchain technology; colored coins; digital assets
AB Since digital artworks are indeed digital content, they face the inherent problem digital content has: the link between content and its original author is very difficult to keep. Additionally, retaining control over digital copies of the content is also a challenging task. Digital coins have solved this very same problem through cryptocurrencies (for instance, Bitcoin) and have opened the door to apply the same techniques to other similar scenarios where ownership of digital assets needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose BArt, a transparent and distributed mechanism for artists to commercialize their digital artwork, keeping control of the copies, monetizing its usage, and maintaining ownership. BArt allows artists to publicly register their work in the Bitcoin blockchain and sell usage rights in exchange for bitcoins. Buyers are allowed to exert the acquired rights. Proper behavior from all parties is enforced by the system with cryptography and economic incentives.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to identify, analyse and organise the literature about blockchains in supply chain management (SCM) context (blockchain-SCM integration) and proposes an agenda for future research. This study aims to shed light on what the main current blockchain applications in SCM are, what the main disruptions and challenges are in SCM because of blockchain adoption and what the future of blockchains holds in SCM.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study followed the systematic review approach to analyse and synthesise the extant literature on blockchain-SCM integration. The review analysed 27 papers between 2008 and 2018 in peer-reviewed journals.
   Findings
   Blockchain-SCM integration is still in its infancy. Scholars and practitioners are not fully aware of the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional business models. However, the electric power industry seems to have a relatively mature understanding of blockchain-SCM integration, demonstrated by the use of smart contracts. Additionally, the disintermediation provided by blockchain applications has the potential to disrupt traditional industries (e.g. health care, transportation and retail).
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are represented mainly by the scarcity of studies on blockchain-SCM integration in leading journals and databases.
   Practical implications - This study highlights examples of blockchain-SCM integration, emphasising the need to rethink business models to incorporate blockchain technology.
   Originality/value
   This study is the first attempt to synthesise existing publications about the blockchain-SCM integration, shedding light on the disruption caused by, and the necessity of, the SCM reconfigurations.

AB In this paper, we analyze the Ethereum blockchain using the complex networks modeling framework. Accounts acting on the blockchain are represented as nodes, while the interactions among these accounts, recorded on the blockchain, are treated as links in the network. Using this representation, it is possible to derive interesting mathematical characteristics that improve the understanding of the actual interactions happening in the blockchain. Not only, by looking at the history of the blockchain, it is possible to verify if radical changes in the blockchain evolution happened.

It follows the efforts of a group of Rohingya diasporic activists using a variety of means, online and offline, to contest the claims and authority of Myanmar, an established territorial state. Their actions can be subsumed into two kinds of politics, a politics of confrontation and a politics of recognition. Taken together, these actions lead to an emergent political formation, a reterritorialised, dispersed, and virtual national community that seeks to mimic some state functions without explicitly calling for self-determination or an independent nation-state. This paper follows four activist projects: YouTube-based Rohingya TV, the effort to join the ConIFA alternative World Football Cup tournament, the campaign to have the Rohingya script recognized by the Unicode Consortium, and the effort to build a database for undocumented Rohingyas using blockchain. This complex of social, political, electronic, and virtual relations is situated against a 20th century political imaginary built around the homeland-people-language trinity, dialectically producing an immanent contradiction.

AB BACKGROUND Food security can benefit from the technology's transparency, relatively low transaction costs and instantaneous applications. A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted blocks, or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be verified at any time in the future. Generally, the robust and decentralized functionality of the blockchain is used for global financial systems, but it can easily be expanded to contracts and operations such as tracking of the global supply chain. In the precision agriculture context, Information and Communications Technology can be further implemented with a blockchain infrastructure to enable new farm systems and e-agriculture schemes. RESULTS The purpose of this review is to show a panorama of the scientific studies (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) on the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector, from both an entirely computational and an applicative point of view. As evidenced by the network analysis, the reviewed studies mainly focused on software aspects (e.g. the architecture and smart contracts). However, some aspects regarding the different blockchain knots (computers always connected to the blockchain network) having the role to store and distribute an updated copy of each block in a food supply-chain, result of crucial importance. CONCLUSION These technologies appear very promising and rich of great potential showing a good flexibility for applications in several sectors but still immature and hard to apply due to their complexity.

AB Bitcoin is the world's leading cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization briefly exceeding $300 billion. This hints at Bitcoin's amorphous nature: Is this a monetary or a corporate measure? Hard values become explicit in the processing of transactions and the digital mining of Bitcoins. Electricity is a primary input cost. Bitcoins earned are often used to circumvent local currency controls and acquire US dollars. For the period August 2010 to February 2018, we examine the financial components of Bitcoin mining revenues, their statistical contribution to daily changes, and to its variance. We provide empirical evidence that Bitcoin transaction processing is capacity constrained.

AB This paper studies the design and management of a distributed energy system incorporating renewable energy generation and heterogeneous end-users from residential, commercial and industrial sectors. A hierarchical framework is first proposed for the energy demand side management through peer-to-peer exchange of energy information in the real-time market. The heterogeneity of demand flexibility associated with different types of users is reflected in the framework with inter-sectorial interactions modelled by a non-cooperative game. The inherent uncertainty of renewable generation is also considered with the technique of receding horizon optimization. Subsequently, smart contracts and decentralized identifier guaranteed by blockchain technologies are implemented to create a seamless, secured and efficient distributed energy system. Finally, a Singapore-based case study is conducted and the results show that with effective interactions among participants, electricity consumption of the entire energy system closely tracks the generation pattern of renewable resources, resulting in a significantly flattened schedule of grid electricity procurement.

AB Background: The protection of private data is a key responsibility for research studies that collect identifiable information from study participants. Limiting the scope of data collection and preventing secondary use of the data are effective strategies for managing these risks. An ideal framework for data collection would incorporate feature engineering, a process where secondary features are derived from sensitive raw data in a secure environment without a trusted third party.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare current approaches based on how they maintain data privacy and the practicality of their implementations. These approaches include traditional approaches that rely on trusted third parties, and cryptographic, secure hardware, and blockchain-based techniques.
   Methods: A set of properties were defined for evaluating each approach. A qualitative comparison was presented based on these properties. The evaluation of each approach was framed with a use case of sharing geolocation data for biomedical research.
   Results: We found that approaches that rely on a trusted third party for preserving participant privacy do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees that sensitive data will not be exposed in modern data ecosystems. Cryptographic techniques incorporate strong privacy-preserving paradigms but are appropriate only for select use cases or are currently limited because of computational complexity. Blockchain smart contracts alone are insufficient to provide data privacy because transactional data are public. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) may have hardware vulnerabilities and lack visibility into how data are processed. Hybrid approaches combining blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and TEEs provide promising frameworks for privacy preservation. For reference, we provide a software implementation where users can privately share features of their geolocation data using the hybrid approach combining blockchain with TEEs as a supplement.
   Conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable the development of new privacy-preserving feature engineering methods by obviating dependence on trusted parties and providing immutable, auditable data processing workflows. The overlap between blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and secure hardware technologies are promising fields for addressing important data privacy needs. Hybrid blockchain and TEE frameworks currently provide practical tools for implementing experimental privacy-preserving applications.

AB Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger system that establishes transparent contract processes and facilitates secure but trusted business transactions. Policy-makers around the world are intrigued by the potential of this emerging technology to solve policy problems, including the challenges of the transition away from centralised, linear models of energy generation and consumption towards decentralised and distributed energy systems. Blockchain has also been promoted as a mechanism to transform carbon markets, yet the focus in this area to date has been on using blockchain to create new carbon market schemes. This paper addresses an important research gap by asking how blockchain could be applied to an existing carbon market. To answer this question, the study uses an established design process to develop an Australian carbon market blockchain design. The paper finds that this design could improve the efficiency, equity and effectiveness of the Australian carbon market. This paper makes an important research contribution to carbon market policy development by developing a blockchain design that could improve how an existing carbon market functions, and the findings presented here are relevant to government and industry stakeholders globally.

AB Purpose Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt and reshape a plethora of industries in the next decade. However, blockchain adoption rates in technology developed countries, such as Ireland, are relatively low. Motivated by blockchain's potential to transform sociotechnical systems, the lack of systematic inquiry pertaining to blockchain studies from an information system perspective, the authors propose the following research question: "How do organizational factors influence blockchain adoption in organizations based in a developed country?" Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the impact of organizational factors on the adoption of blockchain and the adoption of blockchain in companies based in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the methods of qualitative content analysis were used to identify the most important technology-organization-environment (TOE) blockchain adoption factors. Organizational factors are often viewed as the most significant determinants of IT innovation adoption in organizations. Consequently, using a multiple-case study of 20 companies based in Ireland, the authors investigate how the top three organizational factors identified from the blockchain literature affected these companies decision to adopt or not adopt blockchain. Findings The literature review on blockchain adoption identified specific technological, organizational and environmental factors. Furthermore, the case study findings identified three patterns: top management support and organizational readiness are enablers for blockchain adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors explain these patterns by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a developed country. Practical and scientific contributions are also presented.
   Originality/value This is one of the first studies to identify specific TOE blockchain adoption factors. Further, the authors examine how the three most identified organizational adoption factors impact organizations decisions to adopt blockchain. Finally, the authors discuss how the resulting three patterns identified by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a technology developed country.

AB In globalised manufacturing and production environments, companies increasingly tend to exploit public contribution advantages within designing, manufacturing and marketing processes. To be benefited from outbound capabilities, this paper presents a tactical supply chain planning model to integrate the designing process in the form of open innovation within the supply chain main processes. In this regard, a fuzzy mathematical model is proposed to optimise the tactical decisions according to supply chain objectives and open innovation considerations. On the other hand, intellectual property issues and protecting the rights of innovators are significant concerns that sometimes avoid companies to be engaged in open innovation initiatives. Therefore, this paper proposes a registering mechanism in which the ideas and creative works are collected, refined and finally approved within a blockchain platform. Furthermore, in order to deal with epistemic environmental uncertainty, the fuzzy set theory is utilised. To investigate the applicability of the developed model, a case study in home appliances domain is employed. The results show that the company can achieve favourable designs by spending approximately 1% of the supply chain total cost. Additionally, benefiting the registering mechanism can decrease the cost of using non-original designs more than 41%.

AB Blockchain possesses the potential of transforming global supply chain management. Gartner predicts that blockchain could be able to track $2 T of goods and services in their movement across the globe by 2023, and blockchain will be a more than $3 trillion business by 2030. Nowadays, a growing number of blockchain initiatives are disrupting traditional business models in each sector. In this paper, we provide a timely and holistic overview of the state-of-the-art, challenges, gaps and opportunities in global supply chain and trade operations for both the private sector and governmental agencies, by synthesising a wide range of resources from business leaders, global international organisations, leading supply chain consulting firms, research articles, trade magazines and conferences. We then identify collaborative schema and future research directions for industry, government, and academia to jointly work together in ensuring that the full potential of blockchain is unleashed amidst the socioeconomic, geopolitical and technological disruptions that global supply chains and trade are facing.

AB This paper presents current academic and industrial frontiers on blockchain application in supply chain, logistics and transport management. We conduct a systematic review of the literature and find four main clusters in the co-citation analysis, namely Technology, Trust, Trade, and Traceability/Transparency. For each cluster, and based on the pool of articles included in it, we apply an inductive method of reasoning and discuss the emerging themes and applications of blockchains for supply chains, logistics and transport. We conclude by discussing the main themes for future research on blockchain technology and its application in industry and services.

TI Google, the Medium, and Hermeneutic Principles
SO CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Media studies; hermeneutics; Google; medium; search engine
AB Google's role in curating the Internet, is, conceptually, a simple one. It offers speed and knowledge infrastructures of unfathomable size. It is a medium, a filter, through which you, the inquirer, meets information or data provided by other users. What has been more difficult to understand and grapple with, over the twenty-one years since Google Search has existed as an information consolidator, is a) its role as a multimodal digital medium for the user's approach to knowledge design, and b) its media identity as the giant of information consolidation and dispensation, that, based on its famously secret algorithm, supports a business model focused on advertising. In this article, I join a number of media studies and digital culture experts, who warn that we should first begin to understand the Internet before we employ Blockchain technology for Web 3.0 purposes. In order to utilize Google as informed consumers, we need to understand not only what it is as a medium, but also how we as consumers co-create the Googlesphere by both designing and accessing knowledge. For while the mission of Google describes what sounds like a democratic model, the hermeneutics of "organize," "world's information," "universally accessible," and "useful" point to semantic categories with considerable potential for bias, exploitation, or abuse when applied to an advertising enterprise.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Though a relatively new technology, blockchain has become a very trendy topic in recent times, thanks to bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies which are built on the blockchain. With features such as decentralized consensus and data immutability, blockchain transactions are known to be transparent, secure, and trustworthy. For these reasons, blockchain is increasingly being adopted in different industries and for diverse use cases, especially where security and trust are important concerns. Health care is one such industry that offers several use cases for applying blockchain technology. Even so, blockchain-based healthcare applications have yet to become widespread. This is mostly because initial efforts were focused on developing blockchain frameworks for cryptocurrencies and not for general purpose applications, such as health care. Recently, general-purpose blockchain frameworks, which may be used to develop healthcare applications, have begun to emerge. However, there is no consensus on which framework is most suitable for developing healthcare applications. In light of this, this paper compares the popular general-purpose blockchain frameworks, vis-a-vis the requirements for healthcare systems, in order to guide health informatics researchers and practitioners in selecting the appropriate platform for developing and experimenting with blockchain-based healthcare applications.

AB Blockchain technology, born as a tool to support Bitcoins (the most popular and controversial cryptocurrency in the world) has set itself in a very short time as a disruptive technology able not only to revolutionize existing businesses but also to create new ones. This work illustrates the main characteristics of the blockchain and its functioning, and then focuses on the potential applications that can be implemented for developing countries. More specifically, the work, considers the case of financial inclusion in Africa, on the basis of the Global Findex 2017 data, the World Bank Survey on financial inclusion. The empirical analysis identifies the weaknesses in the current financial system in Africa and constitues the basis to discuss potential blockchain solutions to reduce the current level of financial exclusion and pursue sustainable development for African countries.

AB This paper presents a blockchain-based architecture for our current electronic health record (EHR) systems. Being built on top of existing databases maintained by health providers, the architecture implements a blockchain solution to ensure the integrity of data records and improve interoperability of the systems through tracking all events that happen to the data in the databases. In this proposed architecture, we also introduce a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks on the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions; hence, it potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against data misuse.

AB Blockchain is receiving considerable attention among practitioners and academics. However, a detailed analysis investigating how the impact of blockchain is going to unfold is still missing. Our article sets out to assess the radicalness of blockchain at an early stage of its development and substantiates the analysis with evidence from the payments industry. We start by distilling five key aspects of radical innovation from extant literature. Our analysis of blockchain then focuses on the payments industry, which represents a major business field of banking and the cradle of this technology. The results of a Delphi study provide 17 statements about the current development of blockchain. The statements deliver insights into the impact of blockchain on the payments industry and reveal the radicalness of the technology. Based on these insights, we investigate how blockchain affects the five key aspects of radical innovation and develop contributions from an innovation management's perspective.

ID REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
AB Business process compliance checking is an NP-complete problem, due to concurrency and different mutually exclusive execution paths. Although the complexity of real life process models usually allows for a brute force approach, environments with limited resources or computational power (like for instance blockchain environments) cannot rely on brute force approaches due to the computational complexity of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach to efficiently check a subclass of problems involving concurrent sub-processes. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of concurrent sub-processes from combinatorial to exponential. We prove the correctness of the approach, we experimentally validate the results and evaluate the scalability of the approach. We show that our approach is a significant improvement for highly concurrent processes and easily outperforms existing brute force approaches.

TI Dietcoin: Hardening Bitcoin Transaction Verification Process For Mobile

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Distributed ledgers are among the most replicated data repositories in the world. They offer data consistency, immutability, and auditability, based on the assumption that each participating node locally verifies their entire content. Although their content, currently extending up to a few hundred gigabytes, can be accommodated by dedicated commodity hard disks, downloading it, processing it, and storing it in general-purpose desktop and laptop computers can prove largely impractical. Even worse, this becomes a prohibitive restriction for smartphones, mobile devices, and resource-constrained IoT devices.
   In this demo, we present an implementation of Dietcoin, a Bitcoin protocol extension that allows nodes to perform secure local verification of Bitcoin transactions with small bandwidth and storage requirements. This demo presents and benchmarks the main features of Dietcoin that are important for today's cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, but are missing in the current state-of-the-art: (i) allowing resource-constrained devices to verify the correctness of selected blocks locally without having to download the complete ledger; (ii) enabling devices to join a blockchain quickly yet securely, dropping bootstrap time from days down to a matter of seconds; (iii) providing a generic solution that can be applied to other distributed ledgers secured with Proof-of-Work.

AB Digital currency a well-known term in past few years that grabbed the attention all over specially in financial sectors. Bit coin is a modern name use for digital currency in today's world. Many names can be found in the market but Bit coin was first to show trust in digital currency and adopting it as a legal currency. Transactions made using block chain are well secure and transparent to user for monitoring. All signatures are stored in a distributed ledger that keeps the record for transactions happened. Decentralized network is use in block chain technology that connects all the nodes in a network. In this paper, the concept of block chain technology has been incorporated to improve the logistics process using secure digital currency and automate the payment process using bit coins and eliminating third parties interactions. Proposed workflow and conceptual model will help the supply chain management for secure and monitored delivery of goods to end customers. Model will provide advantages for logistics department that includes tracking, transactions updates, transparency, less documentation, on time delivery etc. SHA 256 is used in hashing for data encryption. Customer can also monitor their ordered material status. Proposed conceptual model can be used for all kind of shipment methods i.e. by air, by road, by sea. Paper includes comparison table that will highlight importance of block chain technology.

AB The smart city is one of the most promising, prominent, and challenging applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart cities rely on everything connected to each other. This in turn depends heavily on technology. Technology literacy is essential to transform a city into a smart, connected, sustainable, and resilient city where information is not only available but can also be found. The smart city vision combines emerging technologies such as edge computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence, etc. to create a sustainable ecosystem by dramatically reducing latency, bandwidth usage, and power consumption of smart devices running various applications. In this research, we present a comprehensive survey of emerging technologies for a sustainable smart city network. We discuss the requirements and challenges for a sustainable network and the role of heterogeneous integrated technologies in providing smart city solutions. We also discuss different network architectures from a security perspective to create an ecosystem. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges of the smart city network and provide suitable recommendations to resolve them.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Until now, there has been little research on digital forensics in the IoT (Internet of Things)-based infrastructure. Current digital forensic tools, investigation frameworks, and processes cannot meet the heterogeneity and distribution characteristics of the IoT environment. These characteristics are a challenge for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a digital forensics framework for the IoT environment based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed framework, all communications of IoT devices are stored in the blockchain as transactions, thus making the existing chain of custody process easier and more powerful. By using the blockchain technology, the integrity of the data to be analyzed is ensured and security is strengthened, and the preservation of integrity is made more reliable by a decentralized method of integrity preservation. In addition, since the public distributed ledger is provided, participants in the forensic investigation-such as device users, manufacturers, investigators, and service providers-can confirm the investigation process transparently. We simulated the proposed model to support the proof of concept.

AB The purposes of the study are threefold: (1) develop key successful factors of blockchain platform for micro-enterprises based on Balanced Scorecard (BSC), (2) find out the correlation between the key successful factors of blockchain platform for micro-enterprises, and (3) understand the perception of micro-enterprise blockchain and the difference between theoretical guidance and practical application. This study combines Interpretative Structural Modeling Method, (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze the causal relationships and hierarchical structures of the 12 key successful factors of blockchain platform for micro-enterprises and understand the correlation between factors. The 12 key successful factors developed based on the four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard, and the questionnaire designs based on the concept of DEMATEL, and then analyzed data by DEMATEL and ISM methods to understand the correlation between key factors. The research results show that the key successful factors of blockchain platform for microenterprises include "brand equity", "security and anti-counterfeiting", "sales growth", "transparency and clear", "trust", "consensus mechanism", "traceability", "consistency", "tracking", "innovation management", "international", "organizational adaptation", in which consumer "trust" plays an important role. Micro-enterprises can use blockchain to expand the market, provide customers with better service quality, and bring sales growth to micro-enterprises.

AB A portable smart spectrometer (PSS-1.0) and related systems have been designed and implemented to provide rapid on-site spectral analysis and lower the operator knowledge threshold for the application of spectrometry. The PSS-1.0 employs spectral analysis models downloaded from the spectral analysis system for offline spectral analysis and displays the results in the field. Users are incentivized to upload spectral analysis data to the Internet for storage by big data technologies, so that the spectral data can be reused easily. By employing blockchain technology it can be ensured that the data has not been tampered with, which can be used in monitoring and data transaction scenarios. The design of this spectrometer and related systems can be used for regulatory uses that require spectroscopy. Experimental results are presented in this paper, which prove that the design of the PSS-1.0 is feasible. The purpose of this paper is to design a civilian and non-operator knowledge threshold spectrometer and provide some ideas for better processing and utilization of spectral data.

AB The literature has recently begun to investigate the properties of cryptocurrency markets to identify key drivers for the use of cryptocurrencies in investment strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the financial applications of Bitcoin. The focus is on three lines of research: price formation, detection of market inefficiency, and diversified portfolio construction. Topics such as market micro-structure and the interplay between different cryptocurrencies are only touched on briefly. We observe that many empirical studies find that Bitcoin markets are inefficient, with huge price fluctuations and long-range memory, and that these markets are heavily influenced by news and sector-specific events, or by infrastructure conditions such as volume trading and market liquidity. Nevertheless, astonishing price appreciations and modest correlation values versus other asset classes have contributed significantly to motivate applications of Bitcoin to investment and diversification. Future research may address practical implementations of such solutions and investigate the long-term sustainability and viability of these investment strategies.

AB As a core technology to manage decentralized systems, blockchain is gaining much popularity to deploy such applications as smart grid and healthcare systems. However, its utilization in resource-constrained mobile devices is limited due to high demands of resources and poor scalability with frequent-intensive transactions. Edge computing can be integrated to facilitate mobile devices in offloading their mining tasks to cloud resources. This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage. We based our study on peer-to-peer and blockchain to achieve an Internet of Things (IoT) design supported by edge computing to acquire security and scalability levels needed for the integration. We investigated existing blockchain and associated technologies to discover solutions that address anonymity, integrity and adaptability issues for successful integration of blockchain in IoT systems. The discovered solutions were then incorporated in our conceptual design of the decentralized application prototype presented for secure storage of IoT data and transactions.

AB One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and establishing the concept of "blockchain" as a distributed ledger. As of today, there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial intelligence.

AB Diabetes patients suffer from abnormal blood glucose levels, which can cause diverse health disorders that affect their kidneys, heart and vision. Due to these conditions, diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques, like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with medical scientists, doctors and caretakers, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data. Furthermore, in order to motivate users to add new data to the system, an incentive system based on a digital cryptocurrency named GlucoCoin was devised. Such a system makes use of a blockchain that is able to execute smart contracts in order to automate CGM sensor purchases or to reward the users that contribute to the system by providing their own data. Thanks to all the previously mentioned technologies, the proposed system enables patient data crowdsourcing and the development of novel mobile health (mHealth) applications for diagnosing, monitoring, studying and taking public health actions that can help to advance in the control of the disease and raise global awareness on the increasing prevalence of diabetes.

AB Real-time data about various traffic events and conditions-offences, accidents, dangerous driving, or dangerous road conditions-is crucial for safe and efficient transportation. Unlike roadside infrastructure data which are often limited in scope and quantity, crowdsensing approaches promise much broader and comprehensive coverage of traffic events. However, to ensure safe and efficient traffic operation, assessing trustworthiness of crowdsourced data is of crucial importance; this also includes detection of intentional or unintentional manipulation, deception, and spamming. In this paper, we design and demonstrate a road traffic event detection and source reputation assessment system for unreliable data sources. Special care is taken to adapt the system for operation in decentralized mode, using smart contracts on a Turing-complete blockchain platform, eliminating single authority over such systems and increasing resilience to institutional data manipulation. The proposed solution was evaluated using both a synthetic traffic event dataset and a dataset gathered from real users, using a traffic event reporting mobile application in a professional driving simulator used for driver training. The results show the proposed system can accurately detect a range of manipulative and misreporting behaviors, and quickly converges to the final trust score even in a resource-constrained environment of a blockchain platform virtual machine.

AB The consumption of food and its safety are important for human security. In this paper, we reviewed the literature on future possibilities for transforming the food system through digital solutions in the Barents region. Such digital solutions will make food business operators more efficient, sustainable, and transparent. Developing cross-border infrastructures for digitalization in the region will break the isolation of the local food system, thus simplifying the availability of processed, novel and safe traditional food products. It is necessary for food growers and processors to respond to the trends driven by consumers' demand while ensuring their safety. Our review highlights the opportunities provided by digital technology to ensure safety and help food business operators predict consumer trends in the future. In addition, digitalization can create conditions that are necessary for the diversification of organizational schemes and the effective monitoring of food processing operations that will help to promote food and nutrition security in the Barents region.

TI Idea of Using Blockchain Technique for Choosing the Best Configuration

AB The blockchain technique is becoming more and more popular due to its advantages such as stability and dispersed nature. This is an idea based on blockchain activity paradigms. Another important field is machine learning, which is increasingly used in practice. Unfortunately, the training or overtraining artificial neural networks is very time-consuming and requires high computing power. In this paper, we proposed using a blockchain technique to train neural networks. This type of activity is important due to the possible search for initial weights in the network, which affect faster training, due to gradient decrease. We performed the tests with much heavier calculations to indicate that such an action is possible. However, this type of solution can also be used for less demanding calculations, i.e., only a few iterations of training and finding a better configuration of initial weights.

TI A Systematic Analysis of Real-World Energy Blockchain Initiatives
SO FUTURE INTERNET
LA English
DT Review
DE energy; blockchain; smart grid; microgrid
AB The application of blockchain technology to the energy sector promises to derive new operating models focused on local generation and sustainable practices, which are driven by peer-to-peer collaboration and community engagement. However, real-world energy blockchains differ from typical blockchain networks insofar as they must interoperate with grid infrastructure, adhere to energy regulations, and embody engineering principles. Naturally, these additional dimensions make real-world energy blockchains highly dependent on the participation of grid operators, engineers, and energy providers. Although much theoretical and proof-of-concept research has been published on energy blockchains, this research aims to establish a lens on real-world projects and implementations that may inform the alignment of academic and industry research agendas. This research classifies 131 real-world energy blockchain initiatives to develop an understanding of how blockchains are being applied to the energy domain, what type of failure rates can be observed from recently reported initiatives, and what level of technical and theoretical details are reported for real-world deployments. The results presented from the systematic analysis highlight that real-world energy blockchains are (a) growing exponentially year-on-year, (b) producing relatively low failure/drop-off rates (similar to 7% since 2015), and (c) demonstrating information sharing protocols that produce content with insufficient technical and theoretical depth.

AB Latency is a critical issue that impacts the performance of decentralized systems. Recently we designed various protocols to regulate the injection rate of unverified transactions into the system to improve system performance. Each of the protocols is designed to address issues related to some particular network traffic syndrome. In this work, we first provide the review of our prior protocols. We then provide a hybrid scheme that combines our transaction injection protocols and provides an optimal linear combination of the protocols based on the syndromes in the network. The goal is to speed up the verification process of systems that rely on only one single basic protocol. The underlying basic protocols are Periodic Injection of Transaction via Evaluation Corridor (PITEC), Probabilistic Injection of Transactions (PIT), and Adaptive Semi-synchronous Transaction Injection (ASTI).

AB An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain's immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

AB Blockchain technology is increasingly being used in Internet of things (IoT) devices for information security and data integrity. However, it is challenging to implement complex hash algorithms with limited resources in IoT devices owing to large energy consumption and a long processing time. This paper proposes a RISC-V processor with memristor-based in-memory computing (IMC) for blockchain technology in IoT applications. The IMC-adapted instructions were designed for the Keccak hash algorithm by virtue of the extendibility of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). Then, a RISC-V processor with area-efficient memristor-based IMC was developed based on an open-source core for IoT applications, Hummingbird E200. The general compiling policy with the data allocation method is also disclosed for the IMC implementation of the Keccak hash algorithm. An evaluation shows that >70% improvements in both performance and energy saving were achieved with limited area overhead after introducing IMC in the RISC-V processor.

AB Identity management (IdM) is a method used to determine user identities. The centralized aspect of IdM introduces a serious concern with the growing value of personal information, as well as with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The problem with currently-deployed systems and their dominating approach, with identity providers (IdP) and single-point services, is that a third party is in charge of maintaining and controlling the personal data. The main challenge to manage data securely lies in trusting humans and institutes who are responsible for controlling the entire activity. Identities are not owned by the rightful owners or the user him/herself, but by the mentioned providers. With the rise of blockchain technology, self-sovereign identities are in place utilizing decentralization; unfortunately, the flaws still exist. In this research, we propose DNS-IdM, a smart contract-based identity management system that enables users to maintain their identities associated with certain attributes, accomplishing the self-sovereign concept. DNS-IdM has promising outcomes in terms of security and privacy. Due to the decentralized nature, DNS-IdM is able to avoid not only the conventional security threats, but also the limitations of the current decentralized identity management systems.

AB The blockchain technology is currently a big issue and has also reached the energy industry. It enables transactions that are documented permanently and for everyone in a comprehensible manner, and thus take place without a trustworthy intermediary. Blockchain technology also opens up new possibilities for the energy industry, such as for financing, certification and trading of (renewable) energy. By testing blockchain technology in concrete use cases of the energy sector, the project SonnWende+ deals with the technological possibilities, legal framework conditions and the needs of and the acceptance by stakeholders and users. As part of the co-creation process, a survey among energy decision makers was conducted on the gamechanging potentials they expect through blockchain technology. The survey shows that the energy industry is already actively engaged in the topic of blockchain and that the advantages of this new technology are well appreciated. Special opportunities are seen in the charge management for e-mobility, new forms of energy trading and grid management. About one fifth of the decision-makers surveyed believe in blockchain as a game changer for the energy industry. Accordingly, a high potential for disruption is also expected for some players in the energy industry. However, the survey also reveals a certain amount of skepticism and uncertainty regarding the new technology. The hurdles and dangers mentioned by the decision-makers underline the need for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects that implement, analyze and promote the sensible use of blockchain technology in the energy industry in an application-oriented manner. This built-up know-how will enable the Austrian energy industry to actively shape the framework conditions for the use of blockchain technology in the future.

AB With the rapid development of the energy internet, the transaction of distributed renewable energy (DRE) is playing an increasingly important role in the energy market. However, in the transaction model of distributed renewable energy combined with public blockchain technology, nodes in the trading network can join or leave the network at any time without any permission, which hinders the regulation of electricity institutions. Corresponding to the transaction principle, a distributed renewable energy transaction authentication mechanism based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper. First, certificate authority nodes were set in the transaction network to provide nodes with access authority by controlling the public keys and private keys of trading participants so that they can complete their identity authentication. Next, essential chaincodes in the transaction authentication were designed and deployed on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain site, and a simulation experiment of a simple DRE transaction was used to elaborate the details on the transaction process. Finally, the proposed model was evaluated according to its performance and proved to be practical and effective.

AB In this research work, we apply the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm with a decentralized blockchain approach to handle the electric vehicle (EV) charging process in shared spaces, such as condominiums. A mobile app handles the user authentication mechanism to initiate the EV charging process, where a set of sensors are used for measuring energy consumption, and based on a microcontroller, establish data communication with the mobile app. A blockchain handles financial transitions, and this approach can be replicated to other EV charging scenarios, such as public charging systems in a city, where the mobile device provides an authentication mechanism. A user interface was developed to visualize transactions, gather users' preferences, and handle power charging limitations due to the usage of a shared infrastructure. The developed approach was tested in a shared space with three EVs using a charging infrastructure for a period of 3.5 months.

AB Offloading computation-intensive tasks (e.g., blockchain consensus processes and data processing tasks) to the edge/cloud is a promising solution for blockchain-empowered mobile edge computing. However, the traditional offloading approaches (e.g., auction-based and game-theory approaches) fail to adjust the policy according to the changing environment and cannot achieve long-term performance. Moreover, the existing deep reinforcement learning-based offloading approaches suffer from the slow convergence caused by high-dimensional action space. In this paper, we propose a new model-free deep reinforcement learning-based online computation offloading approach for blockchain-empowered mobile edge computing in which both mining tasks and data processing tasks are considered. First, we formulate the online offloading problem as a Markov decision process by considering both the blockchain mining tasks and data processing tasks. Then, to maximize long-term offloading performance, we leverage deep reinforcement learning to accommodate highly dynamic environments and address the computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive genetic algorithm into the exploration of deep reinforcement learning to effectively avoid useless exploration and speed up the convergence without reducing performance. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can converge quickly and outperform three benchmark policies.

AB The blockchain technology is very useful in many industries. One current application is on diamond authentication and certification, which is important in many luxury supply chains. In this paper, we explore different consumer utility driven operations models and highlight the values of blockchain technology supported (BTS) platforms for diamond authentication and certification. We build models and analytically examine both the traditional retail network operations (Model R) and the BTS selling platform (Model PL). We further extend the analysis to study the case with the BTS certification platform (Model BCR). We reveal the conditions under which one model outperforms the others. In particular, we note that the shopping convenience utility offered by the traditional retailers is a critical factor determining which model is the best Finally, for the BTS platform operations, we study the blockchain-technology-based diamond authentication and certification (BDAC) cost and reveal that reducing it is beneficial to all parties in the luxury supply chain.

The partial decentralized consortium blockchain with limited pre-set nodes can well improve transparency and security, which is suitable for financial regulation. Considering irregularities of the P2P lending market, the Hyperledger-based Peer-to-Peer Lending System (HyperP2PLS) is proposed. First elaborate the application scenario and business logic of the system, where a national P2P Lending Trading Center will be established to integrate all transactions and information of P2P lending market. Then construct the system architecture consisting of the blockchain network, HTTP server, and applications. The algorithm of implementation process and the web application for users have been well illustrated. The performance analysis shows that HyperP2PLS can guarantee the reliability, safety, transparency and efficiency.

TI Company Law, Connecting Factors and the Digital Age - A New Outlook
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Usually connecting factors in company law play a decisive role with regard to the corporate governance model of a company and with regard to the level of protection of stakeholders. Their importance generated along-lasting debate on which connecting factor is "better"and which one is compatible with internal market rules. However, technological developments and digitalisation shed a different light on this discussion.
   In order to understand how the current developments impact the discussion on company law connecting factors, it should first be clear what is really understood by connecting factors in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. It is important to understand the relationship between substantive company law rules and those on conflict of laws.
   The outcome of the above analysis allows to add the digitalisation/new technologies factor into the equation. In this context, a closer look is given at the use of artificial intelligence applications in company law and the operation of a decentralised autonomous organisation within a blockchain network. It allows to question the effectiveness and usefulness of traditional connecting factors.

AB With the continuous development of Internet of things, all kinds of smart systems are quickly evolving to make our day-to-day life smoother and safer. Like many other sectors, transportation has entered a period of rapid change. Intelligent Traffic System is one of the fastest-growing fields within the smart systems, which is expected to increase road safety, mitigate traffic congestion, and enable fuel efficiency. The main functionalities of Intelligent Traffic System are as follows: (1) monitoring real-time traffic conditions in specific areas, (2) locating traffic emergencies (i.e. traffic accidents) in specific areas, and (3) dynamic monitoring and managing the continuous use in public transit services (i.e. change in car lanes) that may lead to changes in macro traffic conditions. This article will use the above-mentioned functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic System as underlying simulative scenarios, to design and to implement a smart transportation system based on Internet of things and blockchain-both share inherent distributed technology characteristics-combining both Internet of things sensor nodes and distributed ledger technology, to (1) record the changes in intelligent transportation systems and (2) set up a credit-token mechanism for paying the use and misuses in public transit services accordingly. The Intelligent Traffic System described in this article is intended to be used as experimental project only, given the terms and conditions as depicted in the simulated scenario. In real-life traffic scenarios, it may generate more complex system and data security issues, which will be elaborated and analyzed at the end of this article. Intelligent Traffic System is a comprehensive smart system; it can significantly change and reinvent the wheel for traffic conditions. Based on the system development as discussed in this article, there are still a lot of demands and challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Such topic scope will be explored in depth in our subsequent research.

TI A blockchain-based framework to secure vehicular social networks

AB Vehicular social network is emerging as a new promising concept, combining two types of network paradigms, namely, vehicular networks and social networks. In order to manage efficiently the security and the control of the network, this paper proposes a new framework based on the emerging concepts of software-defined vehicular network (SDVN) and blockchain. Using the SDVN makes the network more programmable, virtualized, and partitionable. However, on the other hand, it also creates a well-known vulnerability of a single point of failure. Hence, we propose to introduce the blockchain paradigm that will enable the certification of transactions and ensure data anonymity in a fully distributed manner. To this end, three levels of controllers are needed: a principal controller (PC), roadside units (RSUs), and a local controller. In order to dynamically select miners, a distributed miners connected dominating set algorithm (DM-CDS) has been proposed. The DM-CDS is a single-phase distributed algorithm that supports a dynamic topology based on a trust model and some other network parameters, such as the connectivity degree, the average link quality indicator, and the rank. The performance of the proposed DM-CDS is evaluated throughout multiple scenarios using different parameters, such as trust metric, node density, node mobility, and radio range. The obtained results highlight the importance of such proposed architecture, especially in terms of number of required miners. For instance, when the density of nodes increases, the number of selected miners increases similarly to when the network length increases. The node mobility impacts also on the stability of the selected miners, in terms of withdrawing and joining, showing a variation between 0% and 10%. The trust metric has also an important impact on the selection of miners, as only nodes with a higher trust level are selected to endorse the roles of miners.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is able to integrate the computation and physical processes as services in the social world. The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations.

AB We consider users who may have renewable energy harvesting devices or distributed generators. Such users can behave as consumers or producers (hence, we denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. We consider a tieredmarket where the grid selects a price function, which reveals price in the real time based on the total demand to the grid. In the real time, a prosumer can buy from another prosumer in an exchange market knowing the price from the grid. The exchange price is set by a platform and can be different for different sellers. A prosumer is a selfish entity, which selects the amount of energy it wants to buy either from the grid or from other prosumers or the amount of excess energy it wants to sell to other prosumers by maximizing its own payoff. However, the strategy and the payoff of a prosumer inherently depend on the strategy of other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the other prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as a coupled constrained game and seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium. We show that the game is a concave potential game and show that there exists a unique generalized Nash equilibrium. We propose a distributed algorithm that converges to the exchange price, which clears the market and achieves the generalized Nash equilibrium. We, finally, show how the grid should select the price function in a day-ahead scenario by computing the estimated demand from the history. Our numerical result shows that the tiered market can reduce the peak load and increase the prosumers' total payoffs.

AB Chaining, i.e., the mode of operation in which each message is encrypted considering a digital summary of previous ones, is here applied to block-cipher stages based on compressed sensing. We show that this simple and parsimonious technique may significantly harden the resulting system with respect to common threats such that ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Non-negligible robustness comes at the price of not more than a 2% of energy overhead with respect to the pure compression stage which represents a 24 x reduction with respect to straightforward implementation of a traditional cryptography primitive like Advanced Encryption Standard.

AB The introduction of edge computing into blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) for offloading computational tasks is attracting increasing attention. Computing resource trading unavoidably happens in edgeassisted IoT. However, efficient computing resource trading cannot be achieved because of the "cold start" and "long return" problems. To address these challenges, we propose to use a credit-based payment for fast computing resource trading in edge-assisted blockchain-enabled IoT; therefore, the IoT nodes can finish fast payment and frequent trading by borrowing resource coins from other IoT nodes based on their credit values. In our resource-coin loan problem, we propose an iterative double-auction-based algorithm, where a broker is introduced to solve the loan allocation problem and to determine the size of the loan each lender would provide to each borrower. Furthermore, the broker enforces specific loan pricing rules to induce the borrowers and lenders to bid truthfully. Then, the hidden privacy information could be extracted to achieve the optimal resource-coin allocation and loan pricing. The proposed algorithm can maximize the economic benefits while protecting privacy. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm can maximize social welfare. In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with the credit-bank-based method in terms of the satisfaction function and payments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was individually rational, truthful, and budget-balanced.

AB In this paper, we discussed an efficient statistical method with proof-of-work consensus approach for cloud and fog computing. With this method, solution with precise probability in minimal time is realized. We have used the expectation maximization algorithm and polynomial matrix factorization. The advantages of this statistical method are the less iteration to converge to the consensus solution and easiness to configure the complete mathematical model as per the requirement. Moreover, the energy and memory consumption are also less which make this approach appealing for cloud and fog computing. The experimental results also show that the proposed approach is significantly efficient in terms of time and memory consumption. This novel approach seems beneficial for Internetof- Things (IoT), one of the most fast-growing technologies in network computing.

AB Rising to popularity in the last decade, blockchain technology has become the preferred platform for the transfer of digital currency. Unfortunately, many of these environments are rife with vulnerabilities exploited by financially motivated attackers. Worse yet, is that a structured analysis and classification of these vulnerabilities is lacking. In this paper, we present the first formal classifications of these vulnerabilities using National Institute of Standards and Technologies Bugs (NIST'S) Framework and propose two new classes: distributed system protocol (DSP) and distributed system resource management (DRM).

ID INTERNET; THINGS; CHALLENGES
AB Sharing trusted data among trusted stakeholders is very important to large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the entities and organizations involved in IoT naturally lack trusted relationships, which poses significant challenges to the above vision. Specifically, the first challenge is to ensure that the data in the physical world can be objectively and truly injected into the information world of IoT. The second is to ensure the credibility of the entities' identities in IoT. The third is to ensure the authenticity of data, the credibility of identity, and the reliable transmission of data when a third trusted party is unable to provide the expected trusted services. In view of the above challenges, this paper proposes a secure and lightweight triple-trusting architecture (SLTA), which fully uses a blockchain-related supporting technology. The architecture includes an oracle-based data collection mechanism, which ensures that the data collected from edge devices of IoT cannot be modified, and the distributed identity management mechanism, which enhances personal privacy, security, and control of digital identities. Furthermore, a series of innovative designs for applying the blockchain to special large-scale cooperation scenario in IoT are proposed, which is also a part of the key mechanisms of the SLTA. The innovative design includes a new software-defined blockchain structure model and a lightweight Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm that provides credible support for decentralized data collection, identity management, and data transfer, as well as low-overhead sequential storage mechanism.

AB With the development and application of advanced technologies such as Cyber Physical System, Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Blockchain, etc., more manufacturing enterprises are transforming to intelligent enterprises. Smart manufacturing systems (SMSs) have become the focus of attention of some countries and manufacturing enterprises. At present, there are some applications of SMSs in different industrial fields. However, there is still a lack of a unified definition of SMSs and a unified analysis of requirements. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of SMSs, this paper summarized the evolution, definition, objectives, functional requirements, business requirements, technical requirements, and components of SMSs. At the same time, it points out the current development status and level. Based on above, an autonomous SMSs model driven by dynamic demand and key performance indicators is proposed. Through the review of this paper, the reference can be provided for the transformation of more manufacturing enterprises from the traditional to the intellectualized ones.

AB In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology-ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (Bunz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (Bunz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).

AB The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply chain management, storing medical data, and identity management. Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.

AB The power grid is rapidly transforming, and while recent grid innovations increased the utilization of advanced control methods, the next-generation grid demands technologies that enable the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs)-and consumers that both seamlessly buy and sell electricity. This paper develops an optimization model and blockchain-based architecture to manage the operation of crowdsourced energy systems (CESs), with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading transactions (ETTs). An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of ETT and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided.

AB Multimicrogrid (MMG) systems have the potential to play an increasingly important role in the transformation of existing power grid to smart grid. However, the open and distributed connectivity of MMGs exposes the systems into various cyber-attacks, which may cause serious failures or physical damages, such as power supply interruption and human casualties. Therefore, ensuring the security of MMGs is of paramount importance. To address this issue, a new collaborative intrusion detection (CID) approach using blockchain is proposed in this paper for MMG systems in smart grid. Due to the consensus mechanism of blockchain, the approach is designed without the need of a trusted authority or central server while improving the accuracy of intrusion detection in a collaborative way. It is equipped with a proposal generation method that combines periodic and trigger patterns to generate the detection target of CID, i.e., a proposal. From the generated proposals together with the correlation model of MMGs, a CID is achieved by using the consensus mechanism. The final detection results of CID are stored on blockchain in sequence. The use of an incentive mechanism motivates a single microgrid to participate in consensus. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system.

TI IoTPatchPool: Incentivized delivery network of IoT software updates

AB In this paper we introduce IoTPatchPool - a novel scheme that enables an incentivized distributed delivery network of IoT software updates. We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype implementation combining the BitTorrent network with the cryptocurrency Ethereum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Attribute-based encryption, especially ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, plays an important role in the data sharing. In the process of data sharing, the secret key does not contain the specific information of users, who may share his secret key with other users for benefits without being discovered. In addition, the attribute authority can generate the secret key from any attribute set. If the secret key is abused, it is difficult to judge whether the abused private key comes from users or the attribute authority. Besides, the access control structure usually leaks sensitive information in a distributed network, and the efficiency of attribute-based encryption is a bottleneck of its applications. Fortunately, blockchain technology can guarantee the integrity and non-repudiation of data. In view of the above issues, an efficient and privacy-preserving traceable attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed. In the proposed scheme, blockchain technologies are used to guarantee both integrity and non-repudiation of data, and the ciphertext can be quickly generated by using the pre-encryption technology. Moreover, attributes are hidden in anonymous access control structures by using the attribute bloom filter. When a secret key is abused, the source of the abused secret key can be audited. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.

AB Tactile Internet is a fairly recent technological trend associated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, with potential applications in a broad range of industrial, societal and business use cases. The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem) in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground) vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs' requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs' requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates' validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blacklistable anonymous credential systems provide service providers with a way to authenticate users according to their historical behaviors, while guaranteeing that all users can access services in an anonymous and unlinkable manner, thus are potentially useful in practice. Traditionally, to protect services from illegal access, the credential issuer, which completes the registration with users, must be trusted by the service provider. However, in practice, this trust assumption is usually unsatisfied.
   In this paper, we solve this problem and present the decentralized blacklistable anonymous credential system with reputation (DBLACR), which inherits nearly all features of the BLACR system presented in Au et al. (2012) but does not need a trusted party to register users.The new system also has extra advantages. In particular, it enables blacklist (historical behaviors) sharing among different service providers and is partially resilient to the blacklist gaming attack, where dishonest service providers attempt to compromise the privacy of users via generating blacklist maliciously.
   Technically, the main approach to achieve DBLACR system is a novel use of the blockchain technique, which serves as a public append-only ledger. The system can be instantiated from three different types of cryptographic systems, including the RSA system, the classical DL system, and the pairing based system. To demonstrate the practicability of our system, we also give a proof of concept implementation for the instantiation under the RSA system. The experiment results indicate that when authenticating with blacklists of reasonable size, our implementation can fulfill practical efficiency demands. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using a list of companies that changed their names to add "blockchain" or "bitcoin" to their names, we find that after changing the names, these firms have a significant abnormal positive return that lasts for 2 months. The abnormal return turns negative 5 months after the change. This suggests that these firms changed their names to take advantage of the hysteria surrounding the price rise of bitcoin.

TI RepuCoin: Your Reputation Is Your Power
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS

DT Article
DE Blockchain; cryptocurrency; fault tolerance; consensus
AB Existing proof-of-work cryptocurrencies cannot tolerate attackers controlling more than 50 percent of the network's computing power at any time, but assume that such a condition happening is "unlikely". However, recent attack sophistication, e.g., where attackers can rent mining capacity to obtain a majority of computing power temporarily, render this assumption unrealistic. This paper proposes RepuCoin, the first system to provide guarantees even when more than 50 percent of the system's computing power is temporarily dominated by an attacker. RepuCoin physically limits the rate of voting power growth of the entire system. In particular, RepuCoin defines a miner's power by its 'reputation', as a function of its work integrated over the time of the entire blockchain, rather than through instantaneous computing power, which can be obtained relatively quickly and/or temporarily. As an example, after a single year of operation, RepuCoin can tolerate attacks compromising 51 percent of the network's computing resources, even if such power stays maliciously seized for almost a whole year. Moreover, RepuCoin provides better resilience to known attacks, compared to existing proof-of-work systems, while achieving a high throughput of 10000 transactions per second (TPS).

TI Double-spending prevention for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions

DE Double-spending; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Blockchain; ECDSA
AB Zero-confirmation transactions, i.e. transactions that have been broadcast but are still pending to be included in the blockchain, have gained attention in order to enable fast payments in Bitcoin, shortening the time for performing payments. Fast payments are desirable in certain scenarios, for instance, when buying in vending machines, fast food restaurants, or withdrawing from an ATM. Despite being quickly propagated through the network, zero-confirmation transactions are not protected against double-spending attacks, since the double-spending protection Bitcoin offers relies on the blockchain and, by definition, such transactions are not yet included in it. In this paper, we propose a double-spending prevention mechanism for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions. Our proposal is based on exploiting the flexibility of the Bitcoin scripting language together with a well-known vulnerability of the ECDSA signature scheme to discourage attackers from performing such an attack.

AB Due to the urgent requirement to achieve secure communication between service providers (SPs) and smart meters (SMs), including reliable mutual authentication and privacy credentials, key management is critical in smart grids. Recently, a number of key management schemes have been proposed. However, schemes based on trusted third parties (TTPs) become insecure if the TTP fails. Furthermore, the SPs in most schemes are centralized to manage their respective SMs, which involve a single point of failure. Furthermore, SPs cannot monitor each other for data traceability or security auditing. To remedy these inadequacies, we propose a decentralized keyless signature scheme based on a consortium blockchain to realize more efficient and secure key management. The SM sends requests and receive responses using a blockchain network for data transmission operations. We designed a decentralized secure consensus mechanism that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require a TTP or trust anchor. The SPs of the proposed scheme can keep each other in check using the blockchain. In our concluding remarks, we describe how the proposed scheme incurs smaller computational time costs and is both cost-effective and scalable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers, it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature, research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements such as food safety, food quality and food traceability.

AB Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.

AB Recently much emphasize is given on integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures to support the execution of various latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although different real-world frameworks attempt to assist such integration, they have limitations in respect of platform independence, security, resource management and multi-application execution. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, named FogBus that facilitates end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers platform independent interfaces to IoT applications and computing instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers to build applications but also helps users to run multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. Moreover, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Due to its simplified and cross platform software systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FogBus by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeters as IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis. We also evaluate the characteristics of FogBus in respect of other existing frameworks and the impact of various FogBus settings on system parameters through deployment of a real-world IoT application. The experimental results show that FogBus is comparatively lightweight and responsive, and different FogBus settings can tune the computing environment as per the situation demands.

TI Multi-level multi-secret sharing scheme for decentralized e-voting in

AB The cryptosystem-based data privacy preserving methods employ high computing power of cloud servers, where the main feature is to allow resource sharing and provide multi-user independent services. Therefore, to achieve the rapid allocation and release of resource sharing in cloud computing, decentralized cryptographic protocols need to be proposed for multi-user consensus systems. In this work, we first present a multi-secret sharing scheme with multi-level access structure, where the secret reconstruction algorithm satisfies the additive homomorphism. The secret sharing scheme needs no trusted third parties and any user can play the role of dealer. In the designing, multiple target secrets are independently shared, where each subset of users forms a sub-access structure and shares one target secret only with a short secret share. This scheme is efficient and unconditionally secure.
   Furthermore, based on the multi-level access structures, a decentralized multi-role e-voting protocol is designed using Chinese Remainder Theorem, where each role's election is associated with one sub-access structure. The voters employ a shared parameter to blind the sum of ballot values. Meanwhile, the e-voting scheme supports a public verification for the final election results. Compared with the existing e-voting protocols, our e-voting system does not require any authority center and the cloud server runs vote counting. And our e-voting scheme does not need any high-complexity computational cost operation such as module exponential operation, etc. Finally, the common feature of Blockchain and Ad Hoc networks is decentralized. Thus the main idea of this protocol without a trusted third party can be used to achieve a secure consensus among multiple nodes in Blockchain and Ad Hoc network, meanwhile, the consensus results can be verified.

AB Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are paving their path for a revolutionized world in which majority of our objects of everyday use will be interconnected. These objects will be able to link and communicate with each other and their surroundings in order to automate majority of our tasks. This interconnection of IoT nodes require security, seamless authentication, robustness and easy maintenance services. In order to provide such salient features, blockchain comes out as a viable solution. The decentralized nature of blockchain has resolved many security, maintenance, and authentication issues of IoT systems. Therefore, an immense increase in applications of blockchain-based IoT systems can be seen from the past few years. However, blockchain-based IoT network is public, so transactional details and encrypted keys are open and visible to everybody in that network. Thus, any adversary can infer critical information of users from this public infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss the privacy issues caused due to integration of blockchain in IoT applications by focusing over the applications of our daily use. Furthermore, we discuss implementation of five privacy preservation strategies in blockchain-based IoT systems named as anonymization, encryption, private contract, mixing, and differential privacy. Finally, we discuss challenges, and future directions for research in privacy preservation of blockchain-based IoT systems. This paper can serve as a basis of development of future privacy preservation strategies to address several privacy problems of IoT systems operating over blockchain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technologies has attracted considerable attention. However, little effort has been devoted toward investigating the large amount of trade data recorded in blockchains. This paper focuses on transaction data in Ethereum, which is a prominent public blockchain platform supporting not only secure cryptocurrency transfer but also various decentralized applications. By means of the frame- work of network science theory, we find that several transaction features, such as transac-tion volume, transaction relation, and component structure, exhibit a heavy-tailed property and can be approximated by the power law function. In particular, we find that the trans- action relations follow a bow-tie structure with negative assortativity if they are regarded as a directed graph. The popular hubs tend to connect to a large number of common users. We believe that the aforementioned statistics can be ascribed to the vast diversity of trans- actions and the existence of a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to not only carry out a relatively comprehensive inves-tigation of the transaction data recorded in Ethereum but also probe the statistical laws underlying the transaction relationships from the perspective of network science.

AB Aiming at the poor encryption effect existing in the data encryption algorithm of e-commerce platform, and the data lost and distorted easily after encrypting, a data encryption algorithm based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the symmetric key algorithm and the public key algorithm, the DES encryption algorithm is described in detail. The two related technologies of digital envelopes and message authentication are analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the data and the one time encryption of the data. Based on this, in order to ensure the effectiveness of encryption, the process of asymmetric encryption algorithm based on chaotic sequence of neural network and asymmetric encryption algorithm based on neural network chaotic attractor are analyzed, and the security is tested. While ensuring the accuracy of data, it improves the effect of data encryption and realizes the encryption of e-commerce platform data, which is to realize data encryption algorithm based on blockchain technology. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can encrypt the data of e-commerce platform, and the encryption process is relatively simple, the encryption effect is better, and the accuracy of the encrypted data is relatively high, which provides a theoretical basis for further research of the subject.

TI Towards a trusted unmanned aerial system using blockchain for the
   protection of critical infrastructure
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES

DT Article; Early Access
AB With the exponential growth in the number of vital infrastructures such as nuclear plants and transport and distribution networks, these systems have become more susceptible to coordinated cyberattacks. One of the effective approaches used to strengthen the security of these infrastructures is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance and data collection. However, UAVs themselves are prone to attacks on their collected sensor data. Recently, blockchain (BC) has been proposed as a revolutionary technology that can be integrated within Internet of things (IoT) to provide a desired level of security and privacy. However, the integration of BC within IoT networks, where UAV's sensors constitute a major component, is extremely challenging. The major contribution of this study is twofold:(1) survey the security issues for UAV's collected sensor data, define the security requirements for such systems, and identify ways to address them; and (2) propose a novel BC-based solution to ensure the security of and the trust between the UAVs and their relevant ground control stations. Our implementation results and analysis show that using UAVs as means for protecting critical infrastructure is greatly enhanced through the utilization of trusted BC-based unmanned aerial systems.

AB This paper examines the performance of cryptocurrencies issued in initial coin offerings (ICOs) over a three-year period after the initial exchange listing. Average (median) ICO underpricing amounts to 15% (3%), even though 4 out of 10 ICOs destroy value on the first trading day. Liquidity, market capitalization, and high-low price ratios predict returns. Long-run buy-and-hold returns are positive for the mean and negative for the median. For holding periods between one and twenty-four months, the median ICO depreciates by 30%. Evidently, there is substantial positive skewness in the cryptocurrency market. Further, a size effect emerges from the data as an empirical regularity: Large ICOs are more often overpriced and underperform in the long run.

ID PATIENT
AB Personal Health Records (PHRs) have the potential to give patients fine-grained, personalized and secure access to their own medical data and to enable self-management of care. Emergent trends around the use of Blockchain, or Distributed Ledger Technology, seem to offer solutions to some of the problems faced in enabling these technologies, especially to support issues consent, data exchange, and data access. We present an analysis of existing blockchain-based health record solutions and a reference architecture for a "Ledger of Me" system that extends PHR to create a new platform combining the collection and access of medical data and digital interventions with smart contracts. Our intention is to enable patient use of the data in order to support their care and to provide a strong consent mechanisms for sharing of data between different organizations and apps. Ledger of Me is based on around the principle that this combination of event-driven smart contracts, medical record data, and patient control is important for the adoption of blockchain-based solutions for the PHR. The reference architecture we present can serve as the basis of a range of future blockchain-based medical application architectures.

AB Background: In recent years, researchers have made significant efforts in advancing blockchain technology. This technology, with distinct features of decentralization and security, can be applied to many fields. In areas of health data and resource sharing, applications of blockchain technology are also emerging.
   Objective: In this study, we propose a cloud health resource-sharing model based on consensus-oriented blockchain technology and have developed a simulation study on breast tumor diagnosis.
   Methods: The proposed platform is built on a consortium or federated blockchain that possesses features of both centralization and decentralization. The consensus mechanisms generate operating standards for the proposed model. Open source Ethereum code is employed to provide the blockchain environment. Proof of Authority is selected as the consensus algorithm of block generation.
   Results: Based on the proposed model, a simulation case study for breast tumor classification is constructed. The simulation includes 9893 service requests from 100 users; 22 service providers are equipped with 22 different classification methods. Each request is fulfilled by a service provider recommended by the weighted k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The majority of service requests are handled by 9 providers, and provider service evaluation scores tend to stabilize. Also, user priority on KNN weights significantly affects the system operation outcome.
   Conclusions: The proposed model is feasible based on the simulation case study for the cloud service of breast tumor diagnosis and has the potential to be applied to other applications.

AB Key points
   The 2017 Sci-Hub judgement has, to date, proven unenforceable, and it appears that enforcing the 2019 OMICS judgement will similarly prove challenging. Business developments and changing expectations over sharing digital content may also undermine the impact of the ongoing cases against ResearchGate and Georgia State University. Stakeholders should consider these limitations when deciding how to resolve scholarly publishing disputes.

ID BYZANTINE; AGREEMENT
AB A distributed ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be publicly accessed and augmented by everyone, without being maintained by a centralized party. Distributed ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a modern society operates. They can secure all kinds of traditional transactions, such as payments, asset transfers and titles, in the exact order in which the transactions occur; and enable totally new transactions, such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented, however, distributed ledgers scale poorly and cannot achieve their enormous potential.
   In this paper we propose Algorand, an alternative, secure and efficient distributed ledger. Algorand is permissionless and works in a highly asynchronous environment. Unlike prior implementations of distributed ledgers based on "proof of work," Algorand dispenses with "miners" and requires only a negligible amount of computation. Moreover, its transaction history "forks" only with negligible probability: that is, Algorand guarantees the finality of a transaction the moment the transaction enters the ledger.

ID EMISSIONS; ENERGY
AB Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin's blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO(2). This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.

AB The industrial control systems are facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber attacks that can have very dangerous consequences on humans and their environments. In order to deal with these issues, novel technologies and approaches should be adopted. In this paper, we focus on the security of commands in industrial IoT against forged commands and misrouting of commands. To this end, we propose a security architecture that integrates the Blockchain and the Software-defined network (SDN) technologies. The proposed security architecture is composed of: (a) an intrusion detection system, namely RSL-KNN, which combines the Random Subspace Learning (RSL) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to defend against the forged commands, which target the industrial control process, and (b) a Blockchain-based Integrity Checking System (BICS), which can prevent the misrouting attack, which tampers with the OpenFlow rules of the SDN-enabled industrial IoT systems. We test the proposed security solution on an Industrial Control System Cyber attack Dataset and on an experimental platform combining software-defined networking and blockchain technologies. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed security solution.

AB Nowadays, it has been recognized that blockchain can provide the technological infrastructure for developing decentralized, secure, and reliable smart energy grid management systems. However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters' energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters.

AB Recently, connected vehicles (CV) are becoming a promising research area leading to the concept of CV as a Service (CVaaS). With the increase of connected vehicles and an exponential growth in the field of online cab booking services, new requirements such as secure, seamless and robust information exchange among vehicles of vehicular networks are emerging. In this context, the original concept of vehicular networks is being transformed into a new concept known as connected and autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicular use yields a better experience and helps in reducing congestion by allowing current information to be obtained by the vehicles instantly. However, malicious users in the internet of vehicles may mislead the whole communication where intruders may compromise smart devices with the purpose of executing a malicious ploy. In order to prevent these issues, a blockchain technique is considered the best technique that provides secrecy and protection to the control system in real time conditions. In this paper, the issue of security in smart sensors of connected vehicles that can be compromised by expert intruders is addressed by proposing a blockchain framework. This study has further identified and validated the proposed mechanism based on various security criteria, such as fake requests of the user, compromise of smart devices, probabilistic authentication scenarios and alteration in stored user's ratings. The results have been analyzed against some existing approach and validated with improved simulated results that offer 79% success rate over the above-mentioned issues.

AB With the development of information technology, films, music, and other publications are inclined to be distributed in digitalized form. However, the low cost of data replication and dissemination leads to digital rights problems and brings huge economic losses. Up to now, existing digital rights management (DRM) schemes have been powerless to deter attempts of infringing digital rights and recover losses of copyright holders. This paper presents a YODA-based digital watermark management system (Y-DWMS), adopting non-repudiation of smart contract and blockchain, to implement a DRM mechanism to infinitely amplify the cost of infringement and recover losses copyright holders suffered once the infringement is reported. We adopt game analysis to prove that in Y-DWMS, the decision of non-infringement always dominates rational users, so as to fundamentally eradicate the infringement of digital rights, which current mainstream DRM schemes cannot reach.

TI TrustChain: A Privacy Preserving Blockchain with Edge Computing

ID DEPENDABILITY; SECURITY
AB Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the collection, processing, and analysis of various forms of data including the personal data from billions of objects to generate valuable knowledge, making more innovative services for its stakeholders. Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate innovations in intellectual property rights (IPR) databases, techniques and software tools, with an emphasis on selected new developments and their contribution towards achieving advantages for IPR management (IPRM) and wider social benefits. Several industry buzzwords are addressed, such as IPR-linked open data (IPR LOD) databases, blockchain and IPR-related techniques, acknowledged for their contribution in moving towards artificial intelligence (AI) in IPRM. Design/methodology/approach The evaluation, following an original framework developed by the authors, is based on a literature review, web analysis and interviews carried out with some of the top experts from IPR-savvy multinational companies. Findings The paper presents the patent databases landscape, classifying patent offices according to the format of data provided and depicting the state-of-art in the IPR LOD. An examination of existing IPR tools shows that they are not yet fully developed, with limited usability for IPRM. After reviewing the techniques, it is clear that the current state-of-the-art is insufficient to fully address AI in IPR. Uses of blockchain in IPR show that they are yet to be fully exploited on a larger scale. Originality/value A critical analysis of IPR tools, techniques and blockchain allows for the state-of-art to be assessed, and for their current and potential value with regard to the development of the economy and wider society to be considered. The paper also provides a novel classification of patent offices and an original IPR-linked open data landscape.

AB Eastman Kodak is an American technology company that produces imaging products. In 2018, it announced its intentions to enter the crytpocurrency market, raising concerns that it could be taking advantage of a potential cryptocurrency bubble for short-term gains. We analyse the relationships between Kodak, crytocurrency and stock market index returns. We find evidence of a significant, sustained increase in both the share price and price volatility of Kodak after the KODAKCoin announcement, with an increased correlation between the price of Kodak shares and Bitcoin.

AB Blockchain is considered by many to be a disruptive core technology. Although many researchers have realized the importance of blockchain, the research of blockchain is still in its infancy. Consequently, this study reviews the current academic research on blockchain, especially in the subject area of business and economics. Based on a systematic review of the literature retrieved from the Web of Science service, we explore the top-cited articles, most productive countries, and most common keywords. Additionally, we conduct a clustering analysis and identify the following five research themes: economic benefit, blockchain technology, initial coin offerings, fintech revolution, and sharing economy. Recommendations on future research directions and practical applications are also provided in this paper.

AB Blockchain technology allows data to be effectively organized, stored, and shared. Its unique decentralized authentication system means no central database exists to store information. All information is shared by a network of nodes and is continuously updated. Blockchain is currently being used across several industries due to its unique features: tamper-proof records, authenticity, transparency, and elimination of third-party brokers. These features offer potential for applications in libraries, archives, and museums as well.

AB The broadly configured smart city network requires a variety of security considerations for a heterogeneous device environment. Because a network of heterogeneous devices facilitates an attacker's intrusion through a specific device or node, a device management framework is required to manage each node comprehensively. This paper proposes a blockchain-based device management framework for efficient device management, scalable firmware update and resiliences on attacks against smart city network. This framework offers four device management and firmware update mechanisms based on the performance and requirements of each device: bidirectional mechanism of general end node and a unidirectional mechanism of the lightweight end node. This difference optimizes the resource of network and devices in terms of management and security. All management history of each device is stored in the blockchain and transmitting firmware between vendor and management node is conducted through a smart contract of blockchain for security and resilience on the attack. Through the framework proposed in this paper, the confidentiality and availability of device management on smart city network as well as integrity, auditability, adaptability and authentication for each node are ensured and the effectiveness of the proposed framework is presented through the security analysis.

AB The increasing interest in blockchain since the end of 2017 has induced many attempts to apply it to public sector administration. Blockchains have been shown to improve the levels of economic efficiency, security and decentralization in administration. This exploratory study examines the determinants of blockchain administration and their priorities through an analytic-hierarchy process (AHP) analysis. The priority ranking of internal factors was security, economic efficiency, and decentralization. The introduction of blockchains in the evolution of the current e-government to the future of convergent governments will be generalized through trial, error, and learning processes. As experienced both in the knowledge and information society and in the e-government development process, reforming government administration is not solely a technical problem. The study results suggest that future blockchain administration in the public sector be used in the field of e-voting to encourage citizen participation in the process of agenda-setting, to enhance the level of security and transparency of taxation, and to increase the level of equity. Blockchain technology can also be used to improve efficiency in the provision of individually oriented social welfare services. Its adoption via administrative reform may reduce the level of corruption in personnel management, recruitment, and procurement in public sector organizations.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The recent development in IoT and 5G translates into a significant growth of Big data in 5G-envisioned industrial automation. To support big data analysis, Deep Learning (DL) has been considered the most promising approach in recent years. Note, however, that designing an effective DL paradigm for IoT has certain challenges such as single point of failure, privacy leak of IoT devices, lack of valuable data for DL, and data poisoning attacks. To this end, we present BlockDeepNet, a Blockchain-based secure DL that combines DL and blockchain to support secure collaborative DL in IoT. In BlockDeepNet, collaborative DL is performed at the device level to overcome privacy leak and obtain enough data for DL, whereas blockchain is employed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of collaborative DL in IoT. The experimental evaluation shows that BlockDeepNet can achieve higher accuracy for DL with acceptable latency and computational overhead of blockchain operation.

AB Increasingly volatile and distributed energy production challenges traditional mechanisms to manage grid loads and price energy. Local energy markets (LEMs) may be a response to those challenges as they can balance energy production and consumption locally and may lower energy costs for consumers. Blockchain-based LEMs provide a decentralized market to local energy consumer and prosumers. They implement a market mechanism in the form of a smart contract without the need for a central authority coordinating the market. Recently proposed blockchain-based LEMs use auction designs to match future demand and supply. Thus, such blockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of individual households' energy consumption and production. Often, such accurate forecasts are simply assumed to be given. The present research tested this assumption by first evaluating the forecast accuracy achievable with state-of-the-art energy forecasting techniques for individual households and then, assessing the effect of prediction errors on market outcomes in three different supply scenarios. The evaluation showed that, although a LASSO regression model is capable of achieving reasonably low forecasting errors, the costly settlement of prediction errors can offset and even surpass the savings brought to consumers by a blockchain-based LEM. This shows that, due to prediction errors, participation in LEMs may be uneconomical for consumers, and thus, has to be taken into consideration for pricing mechanisms in blockchain-based LEMs.

AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the implications of the 2014 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) publication and guidelines on virtual currency definitions and the overall impact of blockchain technology on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and regulation. The report cites three case study examples, which the FATF paper uses and which this paper questions as to their relevance, especially to the formal banking sector. Design/methodology/approach The paper has provided a critical analysis of a FATF publication and guideline document. Additional secondary data has been used on blockchain technology and to analyse the relevance and implications of the case studies used in the FATF document. Findings The main findings are that virtual currency technology has the potential to support AML frameworks within banking when and if they are better understood. However, generic case examples of virtual currency legal cases are not necessarily useful when developing AML risk assessment frameworks within the banking sector.
   Originality/value The originality of this paper is the topic of blockchain technology being considered in AML frameworks and the critical analysis of the FATF cases.

AB E-Voting (Electronic Voting) is a mechanism of voting through electronic means to aid the chores of casting and counting of votes. It can be defined as a voting machine connected to internet, to this e-voting mechanism we introduce blockchain technology. In this method each voter will be a peer in the network of peers, it has a decentralized architecture where it runs on a voting pattern which is fair, open and verifiable system where ballot-box is a transparent medium. Blockchain is a growing list of records called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. It is a decentralized, distributed and an immutable ledger to store digital transactions. Its databases are managed using peer-to-peer network where all the nodes in a network are equal and is the major concern in the types of network architecture. The decentralization of blockchain means that it won't depend on a central point of control. With a lack of single authority, which makes the system equitable and more secure to validate transactions and to record data which makes it incorruptible. It uses consensus protocol for efficient transmission and communication of data between nodes. There are many online voting systems available which are of client-server architecture and will have single point of failure, but using blockchain technology we can eliminate it and provide more efficient mechanism for existing one. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient and secured way of e-voting using blockchain technology, the e-voting is done in a decentralized network and there exist many approaches, but the approach using blockchain technology provides a new dimension to the application.

AB The text shows an academic research that seeks to present emerging technologies as effective mechanisms to fight corruption. It exposes the problems and how the State has adopted ineffective internal control processes based on a traditional structure. The use of information technologies and communication is already an element incorporated in public policy, which complies with the principle of legality to implement data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other tools in public management. However, it is not enough to adapt to technological changes, but to implement them efficiently to solve problems and exalt the principles of administrative activity.

TI LIBERALISING BLOCKCHAIN: AN APPLICATION OF THE GATS DIGITAL TRADE
   FRAMEWORK
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain technology and the World Trade Organization share the same principles of liberalisation and democratisation of trade. Relying on cross-border data flows and an open environment, blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and smart contracts, dispense with a central intermediary and distribute the function of validating transactions to a peer-to-peer network of participants, who maintain and update a record of all transactions in a transparent and immutable distributed ledger. The General Agreement on Trade in Services ('GATS') as the only multilateral treaty that creates binding international obligations on the treatment to be accorded to service suppliers, including online services provides a solid foundational framework for services supplied by participants on blockchain, even if, unsurprisingly, several grey areas exist. Applying GATS to blockchain means that many prohibitive regulations imposed by countries from banning mining to criminalising the possession of cryptocurrencies may be considered barriers to trade.

AB This paper reviews some recent blockchain-based applications for information capture, distribution and preservation. As part of that review, this paper examines two key concerns with current blockchain designs for accounting and supply chain transactions: data independence and multiple semantic models for the same information distribution problem. Blockchain applications typically integrate database, application and presentation tiers all in the same ledger. This results in a general inability to query information in the ledger and other concerns. Further, since most applications appear to be private blockchain applications, there is a concern of agents needing to accommodate multiple blockchains depending on who their trading partners are and what they request. Finally, this paper uses a distributed database to design a 'blockchain-like' system for virtual organizations.

TI CAPER: A Cross-Application Permissioned Blockchain
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability.

ID CONCURRENCY-CONTROL; SNAPSHOT ISOLATION
AB In this paper, we design and implement the first-ever decentralized replicated relational database with blockchain properties that we term blockchain relational database. We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.

AB An intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) is presented in this paper that is assisted with an Android application for smart consumption of water in small are medium-scale garden and fields. The proposed system banks on a set of accessible and economical sensors that capture real-time data of plants and environment conditions such as Soil Moisture Level, Light Intensity, air humidity, air temperature, etc. Once the data is collected from sensors on a server, the proposed SWS processes the data to decide about the watering schedule using Block-chain and Fuzzy Logic approach. Here, Fuzzy Logic approach helps in taking smart decisions with respect to watering requirements and Block-chain provides the required security in IoT enabled system by allowing only the trusted devices to access and manage the proposed SWS. In our approach, Blockchain technology plays an important role by providing scalability, privacy, and reliability in the proposed IoT base smart system. The multiple users and devices can be involved in monitoring and interacting remotely with plants by using Smart Watering System (SWS) (prototype) application that is developed in Android. Once the Fuzzy Logic based system decides the action on the bases of values of the input variables, the SWS activates the actuators to take watering actions such as turning water tunnels ON/OFF in periodical manner. The results of the proposed system show that it is efficient and secure application to efficiently handle the watering process of plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Internet of things (IoT) technology, which is currently considered the new growth engine of the fourth industrial revolution, affects our daily life and has been applied to various industrial fields. Studies on overcoming the limitations of scalability and stability in a centralized IoT operating environment by employing distributed blockchain technology have been actively conducted. However, the nature of IoT that ensures connectivity with multiple objects at any time and any place increases security threats. Further, it extends the influence of the cyber world into the physical domain, resulting in serious damage to human life and property. Therefore, we aim to study a method to increase the security of IoT devices and effectively extend them simultaneously. To this end, we analyze the authentication methods and limitations of traditional IoT devices and examine cases for improving IoT environments by using blockchain technology. Accordingly, we propose a framework that allows IoT devices to be securely connected and extended to other devices by automatically evaluating security using blockchain technology and the whitelist. The method proposed in this paper restricts the extension of devices vulnerable to security risks by imposing penalties and allows only devices with high security to be securely and quickly authenticated and extended without user intervention. In this study, we applied the proposed method to IoT network simulation environments and observed that the number of devices vulnerable to security was reduced by 48.5% compared with traditional IoT environments.

AB At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction.

DE Blockchain; security; privacy
AB Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.

TI Regulation as both enabler of technology use and global competitive

   BENEFITS; ICT
AB Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as Blockchain appear to have disruptive economic potential to traditional finance-sector and non-financial markets as the success of crypto currencies demonstrates. While traditional financial and securities markets are highly regulated, DLT transactions and exchanges have so far widely remained unregulated, which potentially poses major threats to individual investors and, via money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion, to society at large. Governments have been taking different approaches to monitoring and regulating the fledgling DLT provision arena. However, the small jurisdiction of Gibraltar, an affluent self-governed and self-financed British overseas territory with a population of 34,000 at the Southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has taken a proactive approach. What makes this case stand out is that Gibraltar is not only is the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate general DLT provision, but it is rather using the regulation as a competitive tool and a means for creating new public value. The study inquires the potential benefits and challenges to this particular approach to DLT provision regulation, and it investigates and presents the various facets of public value generation, which might serve as a poster child for fast and smart regulation in the digital age.

TI Smart Contract-Based Pool Hopping Attack Prevention for Blockchain

DT Article
DE smart contract; pool hopping; blockchain; mining pool
AB Pool hopping attack is the result of miners leaving the pool when it offers fewer financial rewards and joining back when the rewards of mining yield higher rewards in blockchain networks. This act of leaving and rejoining the pool only during the good times results in the miner receiving more rewards than the computational power they contribute. Miners exiting the pool deprive it of its collective hash power, which leaves the pool unable to mine the block successfully. This results in its competitors mining the block before they can finish mining. Existing research shows pool hopping resistant measures and detection strategies; however, they do not offer any robust preventive solution to discourage miners from leaving the mining pool. To prevent pool hopping attacks, a smart contract-based pool hopping attack prevention model is proposed. The main objective of our research is maintaining the symmetrical relationship between the miners by requiring them all to continually contribute their computational power to successfully mine a block. We implement a ledger containing records of all miners, in the form of a miner certificate, which tracks the history of the miner's earlier behavior. The certificate enables a pool manager to better initiate terms of the smart contract, which safeguards the interests of existing mining pool members. The model prevents frequent mine hoppers from pool hopping as they submit coins in the form of an escrow and risk losing them if they abandon the pool before completing mining of the block. The key critical factors that every pool hopping attack prevention solution must address and a study of comparative analysis with existing solutions are presented in the paper.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is the core technology of technological revolution and industrial transformation. As one of the new intelligent needs in the AI 2.0 era, financial intelligence has elicited much attention from the academia and industry. In our current dynamic capital market, financial intelligence demonstrates a fast and accurate machine learning capability to handle complex data and has gradually acquired the potential to become a "financial brain." In this paper, we survey existing studies on financial intelligence. First, we describe the concept of financial intelligence and elaborate on its position in the financial technology field. Second, we introduce the development of financial intelligence and review state-of-the-art techniques in wealth management, risk management, financial security, financial consulting, and blockchain. Finally, we propose a research framework called FinBrain and summarize four open issues, namely, explainable financial agents and causality, perception and prediction under uncertainty, risk-sensitive and robust decision-making, and multi-agent game and mechanism design. We believe that these research directions can lay the foundation for the development of AI 2.0 in the finance field.

DT Article
DE image authentication; Merkle tree; hash function; blockchain;
   distributed storage
AB Research on digital image processing has become quite popular and rapid in recent years, and scholars have proposed various image verification mechanisms. Similarly , blockchain technology has also become very popular in recent years. This paper proposes a new image verification mechanism based on the Merkle tree technique in the blockchain. The Merkle tree root in the blockchain mechanism provides a reliable environment for storage of image features. In image verification, the verification of each image can be performed by the Merkle tree mechanism to obtain the hash value of the Merkle tree node on the path. In addition, the method combines the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to improve the availability of images. The main purpose of this paper is to achieve the goal of image integrity verification. The proposed method can not only verify the integrity of the image but also restore the tampered area in the case of image tampering. Since the proposed method employs the blockchain mechanism, the image verification mechanism does not need third party resources . The verification method is performed by each node in the blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully achieved the goal of image authentication and tampered area restoration.

AB Based on the high-frequency recordings from Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange and professional trading platform that aims to bring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, the multiscale cross-correlations involving the Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Euro (EUR) and US dollar (USD) are studied over the period between 1 July 2016 and 31 December 2018. It is shown that the multiscaling characteristics of the exchange rate fluctuations related to the cryptocurrency market approach those of the Forex. This, in particular, applies to the BTC/ETH exchange rate, whose Hurst exponent by the end of 2018 started approaching the value of 0.5, which is characteristic of the mature world markets. Furthermore, the BTC/ETH direct exchange rate has already developed multifractality, which manifests itself via broad singularity spectra. A particularly significant result is that the measures applied for detecting cross-correlations between the dynamics of the BTC/ETH and EUR/USD exchange rates do not show any noticeable relationships. This could be taken as an indication that the cryptocurrency market has begun decoupling itself from the Forex.

AB Modern supply chains have evolved into highly complex value networks and turned into a vital source of competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects.

AB Electronically signing contracts is fundamental for e-commerce transactions. The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security.

AB The crowdsourcing schemes which utilize the social network to solve complex tasks are an important part of open cooperation over the Internet. Although blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes have considerable advantages in decentralization and data sharing, there is still a challenge to gurantee the security of crowdsourced-sensitive information and the fairness of crowdsourcing on the blockchain. To this end, this article investigates a crowdsourcing scheme based on blockchain. First, we define the basic requirements of blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes including fairness, confidentiality, and integrity. And then, using secure hash, commitment, and homomorphic encryption, we propose a blockchain-based secure and fair crowdsourcing scheme, that is, BFC. The analysis results show that our scheme can satisfy the above requirements. Finally, the experimental results show that the computational overhead of the BFC scheme is acceptable to both the requester and the workers. In a word, our proposed crowdsourcing scheme has good expansibility in reality.

AB With the ever-growing popularity of the blockchain technology in business and utilizing a token-based economy as a pillar for various recent projects, the legal aspect of tokenized structures and assets poses a significant and relevant challenge. This contribution seeks to outline the legal handling of tokenized structures in Liechtenstein as well as issues with the tokenization of assets from a legal point of view, while drawing an outlook on the potential future situation in view of the upcoming Liechtenstein Trustworthy Technologies Act (TTA) and future European Union legislation. The TTA is set to come into force in late 2019.

AB An initial coin offering (ICO) provides a new entrepreneurial finance approach for highly innovative blockchain ventures. However, the information asymmetry and adverse selection is severe in the ICO market. In this study, we focus on signals released in multiple channels in different ICO stages to investigate the relations between signal processing and information asymmetry. Referring to the multiple-channel communication theory, we characterize signal sources by their information schema, source credibility, and communication direction. Empirical results indicate that in the crowd sale stage, high credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales. In the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant effects on token trading. High credible and hard-interpretable signals, which deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages, causing information asymmetry in ICOs. We also find that investor comments on social media, which is a multiple-way communication channel, play the role of information surveillance for ventures' voluntary disclosures. Those findings provide insights for signal processing and asset pricing in the ICO market to reduce information asymmetry and have significant practical implications.

TI SPB: A Secure Private Blockchain-Based Solution for Distributed Energy
   Trading
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain is increasingly being used to provide a distributed, secure, trusted, and private framework for energy trading in smart grids. However, existing solutions suffer from a lack of privacy, processing and packet overheads, and reliance on trusted third party (TTP) to secure the trade. To address these challenges, we propose a secure private blockchain (SPB) framework. SPB enables energy producers and consumers to directly negotiate the energy price. To reduce the associated overheads, we propose a routing method which routes packets based on the destination public key (PK). SPB eliminates the reliance on TTP to ensure both energy producer and consumer commit to their obligations by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The latter consists of two transactions: first the consumer generates a CTP transaction, committing to pay the energy price to the producer. On receipt of the energy, the smart meter of the consumer generates an energy receipt confirmation (ERC) which triggers a smart contract to transfer the committed price in CTP to the energy producer. To verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart meter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters to prevent malicious nodes from linking ERC transactions and thus enhance the user privacy. Qualitative security analysis shows the resilience of SPB against a range of attacks. Implementation results demonstrate that SPB reduces monetary cost and delay compared to existing solutions.

TI Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts in terms of Law of Obligations

SO ISTANBUL HUKUK MECMUASI
LA Turkish
DT Article
DE Blockchain-technology; Smart contracts; Bitcoin; Decentralized network;
   Termination of the contract; Right to be forgotten
AB Blockchain technology is essentially a registry that records data in encrypted form, which is not kept by a central organization, and all information in encrypted form is shared with every participant in the system. The transactions carried out in this register are recorded in blocks, these blocks are linked to each other and each new transaction must be kept unchanged with the information of the previous transactions in order to be approved. For this reason, blockchain technology is considered to be a technology that eliminates intermediary institutions, offers equal opportunities to every participant and is almost impossible to manipulate. In particular, the digital currency, referred to as co Bitcoin, is based on this technology, but blockchain technology is not limited to this. There is no uniform appearance of the blockchain technology.
   Smart contracts, which provide a framework for transactions on the blockchain network, allow system participants to make many different transactions among them by simply going beyond crypto currency transactions.
   However, blockchain technology based on the principle that the transaction history cannot be changed and the smart contracts associated with this technology also bring many problems in terms of data protection law and law of obligations.
   The aim of this study is to evaluate block-chain technology in terms of our current legal order, especially in terms of data protection law and law of obligations.

TI Using Blockchain to Rein in the New Post-Truth World and Check the
   Spread of Fake News
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, "fake news" has become a global issue that raises unprecedented challenges for human society and democracy. This problem has arisen due to the emergence of various concomitant phenomena such as 1) the digitization of human life and the ease of disseminating news through social networking applications (such as Facebook and WhatsApp); 2) the availability of "big data" that allows customization of news feeds and the creation of polarized so-called "filter-bubbles"; and 3) the rapid progress made by generative machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in creating realistic-looking yet fake digital content (such as text, images, and videos). There is a crucial need to combat the rampant rise of fake news and disinformation. In this article, we propose a high-level overview of a blockchain-based framework for fake news prevention and highlight the various design issues and consideration of such a blockchain-based framework for tackling fake news.

DT Article
AB The revolution of Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) has stimulated a substantial response from academia, research, and industry due to its massive potential to improve overall transportation. Current IoV faces huge challenges due to its reliance on IP-based network architecture. Therefore, named data networking (NDN) is proposed as a promising architecture to solve issues posed by IP-based systems. Recently, blockchains (BCs) have been utilized within IoV to increase network security. However, the integration of BC within NDN-enabled IoV is still an open research problem. In this study, we proposed a novel tier-based architecture known as "Blockchain in NDN-enabled Internet-of-vehicles (BINDN)," which can support BC within NDN-enabled IoV. BINDN can be used as reference architecture to design security solutions in NDN-enabled IoV using BC. Furthermore, it provides an extensive set of applications including IoV security, trust management, and privacy enhancements. Moreover, we highlighted major challenges and issues when integrating BC within NDN-enabled IoV.

ID EVOLUTION
AB Previous studies showed that a number of factors play roles in influencing Bitcoin penetration and acceptance, both at country and individual level, such as trust, perceived risk, security threat, perceived benefit, perceived ease of use, as well as macro-technological and socioeconomic factors. This present study aimed at finding theoretical models at the macro- and microlevels that are able to explain the penetration and acceptance. Study 1 examined hypotheses on the predictive relationship between national cultural orientation and Bitcoin penetration involving 60 countries. Study 2, using a construal level perspective, tested the predictive strength of psychological distances against Bitcoin acceptance, involving 565 Indonesians (M-age = 28.88 years, SDage = 12.482 years). The results showed that national culture of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation are able to predict the penetration. Spatial/physical distance, social distance, and hypothetical distance are able to predict the acceptance. This research is pivotal in obtaining the fundamental factors of community vulnerability in accepting and endorsing new e-money, i.e. Bitcoin. Monetary policy is expected to consider cultural and psychological factors in intervening against economic-technological disruptive innovations developing among societies.

AB Smart grids incorporating internet-of-things are emerging solutions to provide a reliable, sustainable and efficient electricity supply, and electric vehicle drivers can access efficient charging services in the smart grid. However, traditional electric vehicle charging systems are vulnerable to distributed denial of service and privileged insider attacks when the central charging server is attacked. The blockchain-based charging systems have been proposed to resolve these problems. In 2018, Huang et al. proposed the electric vehicle charging system using lightning network and smart contract. However, their system has an inefficient charging mechanism and does not guarantee security of key. We propose a secure charging system for electric vehicles based on blockchain to resolve these security flaws. Our charging system ensures the security of key, secure mutual authentication, anonymity, and perfect forward secrecy, and also provides efficient charging. We demonstrate that our proposed system provides secure mutual authentication using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and prevents replay and man-in-the-middle attacks using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare computation and communication costs with previous schemes. Therefore, the proposed charging system efficiently applies to practical charging systems for electric vehicles.

AB Although metrological traceability is defined as an unbroken chain of calibrations to a national or international metrological standard, only the reference standard which is located immediately upstream in the calibration chain is shown on a calibration certificate. The blockchain technology proposed in this paper makes it possible for the owner of the certificate to visualize the chain of calibrations to the primary standard. It also provides the prevention measures of falsification of the certificates, assurance of authenticity and integrity of the certificates, and access control of the certificates.

AB The digitalization and massive adoption of advanced technologies in the automotive industry not only transform the equipment manufacturer's operating mode, but also change the current business models. The increased adoption of autonomous cars is expected to disrupt government regulations, manufacturing, insurance, and maintenance services. Moreover, providing integrated, personalized, and on-demand services have shared, connected, and autonomous cars in the smart city for a sustainable ecosystem. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based distributed framework for the automotive industry in the smart city. The proposed framework includes a novel miner node selection algorithm for the blockchain-based distributed network architecture. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we simulated the proposed model on a private Ethereum blockchain platform using captured dataset of mined blocks from litecoinpool. org. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed model that can be used for wide range of future smart applications.

AB Since the beginning of the 21st century, there is no doubt that humanity has made a huge step forward in the field of robotics. In the next 20 years, financial reporting will see a stronger change thanks to machine learning, artificial intelligence, block chain, and big data usage. With the convergence of artificial intelligence and block chain, it is now clear that in the near future the work of the accounting profession will be supported by automation. Thus, the aim of the study to introduce the effects of technological changes and transformations on the future of financial reporting. The study first introduces technological tools and provides an overview of the advantages and threats of technological changes to financial reporting. Then, the study provides a case of Amazon Go to display the transformation of financial reporting with the technological changes.

ID INTERNATIONALIZATION
AB This study explores impact factors that affect the adoption of digital payment systems in sub-Saharan Africa. In this article, we investigate the impact factors that subject-matter experts consider most important to the success of FinTech payment models. The data and their responses are evaluated through the lens of Christensen's market-creation theory, which contends that the adoption of market-creating innovations by a mass swathe of heretofore non-consumers "pulls" framework conditions into place, including missing infrastructure and enabling regulation. Then, we compare the findings with the literature and three case studies of mobile money adoption in Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the payment and money transfer segment of FinTech innovations in Africa using a multiple case study methodology. We drew together information from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, archival data in the form of industry and regulatory reports, and observational field notes. Our findings suggest that enabling environments (Kenya) do jumpstart adoption and difficult frameworks (Nigeria) do evolve. This study will help FinTech innovators, academics, and policymakers to understand how technology and framework conditions impact payment business models in Africa.

AB This special section shifts analytical attention onto efforts undertaken by dispersed sets of actors operating in online communities to mobilize a novel internet-based technology that mysteriously appeared at the height of market volatility in 2008. Applications of blockchain technologies and the challenges presented to longstanding patterns of financial globalization are analysed by a group of scholars with backgrounds in anthropology, political science and sociology. This introductory article first elaborates what blockchain technologies consist of before foreshadowing the insights that the following interdisciplinary investigations yield for comprehending the implications that technological changes pose for global finance specifically and globalization more generally.

   CRISIS; HIERARCHICAL AUTHORITY; REGULATION
ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB In this article, I discuss the role of crypto-coins (CCs) as an explicit response to the 2008 economic crisis. Drawing on networked social movement theory, I outline the tension between blockchain based currencies promoted as horizontal markets of technological innovation and the persistence of hierarchical authority within these networks. By examining the assumptions about authority and regulation that underpin the creation of CCs I argue that the cryptographic responses to the financial crisis understate the persistence of hierarchies in their claims to upset traditional monetary authority. As global networks, blockchain technology faces political challenges from regulators, hegemonic market actors and adherents devoted to particular CCs. Consequently, I draw parallels between CCs and networked social movements to argue that the emergence and proliferation of 'altcoins' presents a series of political challenges to the framing of CCs as disruptive technology. The innovative character of CCs relies on tacit and explicit assumptions about politics that social movement theory can help to explain. By examining the altcoins through the concepts of resource mobilization, framing and identity formation, I argue that the dynamics of offline social hierarchies persist and are magnified in the world of CCs.

TI Blockchains, trust and action nets: extending the pathologies of

AB Blockchains combine digital encryption and time stamping technologies to enable digital exchange to occur in manners celebrated by proponents as 'trust-free'. Yet, an increasing range of scholars argue that actual applications of the peer-to-peer technology shifts, rather than eliminates, trust. In this article, we draw on organizational theory to argue that efforts to remove trust reorganize the action nets that underpin payment systems in manners that extend rather than eliminate longstanding pathologies afflicting financial globalization. Our analysis supports and extends the critiques that blockchain applications are far from 'trust-free'. By tracing how efforts to reconfigure the socio-technical composition of the humans and objects that underpin payment systems, we illustrate how blockchain applications shift the location and character of the technical vulnerabilities that create market instabilities and concentration, as well as elite-led governance.

ID ALGORITHMIC GOVERNANCE
AB The emerging blockchain technology is expected to contribute to the transformation of ownership, government services and global supply chains. By analysing a crisis that occurred with one of its frontrunners, Ethereum, in this article I explore the discrepancies between the purported governance of blockchains and the de facto control of them through expertise and reputation. Ethereum is also thought to exemplify libertarian techno-utopianism. When 'The DAO', a highly publicized but faulty crowd-funded venture fund was deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, the techno-utopianism was suspended, and developers fell back on strong network ties. Now that the blockchain technology is seeing an increasing uptake, I shall also seek to unearth broader implications of the blockchain for the proliferation or blockage of global finance and beyond. Contrasting claims about the disruptive nature of the technology, in this article I show that, by redeeming the positive utopia of ontic, individualized debt, blockchains reinforce our belief in a crisis-ridden, financialized capitalism.

AB Since new distributed ledger technologies hold out a promise to restructure cross-border flows of people and material resources, they affect globalization and alter transnational spaces. Their capacity to facilitate secure and disintermediated value transfer through crypto-code and smart contracts enables novel forms of remittance transfer, resource management and digital identity verification - and may also generate new vulnerabilities. In this article, we examine the use of emerging blockchain applications in various migration and diaspora related initiatives in the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and Europe. By building on existing social networks of mutual obligation and quasi-ethnic affinities, blockchain technologies may facilitate the ability to enlarge the scope of diasporas and change the nature of belonging, sovereignty, migration and statehood. Through exploring the selective foregrounding of mutuality and materiality in such alternative value transfer systems, we seek to explain the dynamics of trust and agency that these networks generate to extend commitments and loyalties in the transnational space.

AB As a distributed ledger technology, the block-chain has gained much attention from both the industrical and academical fields, but most of the existing blockchain protocols still have the cubical dilatation problem. Although the latest Rollerchain has mitigated this issue by changing the blockheader's contents, the low efficiency, severe capacity expansion and non-scalability problems still hinder the adoption of Rollerchain in practice. To this end, we present the pruneable sharding-based blockchain protocol by utilizing the sharding technique and PBFT(Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm in the improved Rollerchain, which has high efficiency, slow cubical dilatation, small capacity expansion and high scalability. Moreover, the pruneable sharding-based blockchain protocol is certifiably secure and scalable. The experimental results show the protocol has good performance.

AB Supply chain operations have entered the digital era with the emergence of blockchain technology. In this paper, we discuss how the mean-variance (MV) approach can be applied to explore global supply chain operations risk with air logistics in the blockchain technology era. To be specific, we examine the related literature from four areas, namely air-logistics operations, demand management, supply management, and supply-demand coordination. We propose how the blockchain technology can be applied to facilitate the implementation of mean-variance risk analysis for global supply chain operations. We then highlight several promising areas for further studies. A future research agenda is developed.

AB All-conjugated donor-acceptor block copolymers (BCP) were synthesized in a one-pot reaction by a Stille coupling polycondensation through a terminal functional polymer copolymerization process. Mono bromo endfunctionalized P3HT samples with various molecular weights (P3HT-Br, M-n: 5, 9, and 26 kg/mol) were copolymerized with AA (N,N'-Bis(2-decy1-1-tetradecy1)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide, NDI) and BB (5,5'-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithiophene) type monomers. Further purification by preparative GPC removed excess P3HT to yield block copolymers of low polydispersities with different donor and acceptor block chain lengths. The block copolymers were characterized by H-1-NMR and UV-vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopy. The optical properties, film morphologies, and optoelectronic properties of the block co-polymer were strongly influenced by the donor and acceptor block chain lengths. Furthermore, the fully conjugated D-A block copolymer films exhibited fine structures, smooth film morphologies, and better OPV performance than those features of P3HT/PNDIT2 polymer blends. In polymer solar cells based on the various block copolymer as active layers, the device power convention efficiency was improved by maintaining the acceptor block content at 40-50 kg/mol and increasing the P3HT chain from 5 to 26 kg/mol.

   Business process re-engineering
AB The emergence of blockchain technology has created a number of potential innovations in handling business activities across various industries. However, few studies discuss the potential influence of blockchain technology from a business process re-engineering perspective. This study focuses on the feasibility and inceptive application of supply chain processes. We proposed a blockchain-based framework along with the use of an affiliated technology, i.e., smart contracts, to derive the feasible benefits of the supply chain process design. Through the illustrative design of an integrated process, we provide an achievable use case of the disintermediation of business processes via a conceptual, shared information ledger. This ledger not only facilitates the sharing of tracking information but also promotes a network for multilateral collaboration among supply chain members. The pursuit of transparency and accountability across supply chain processes can potentially influence decentralization and automation. A comparative analysis of the current and proposed frameworks is conducted to support the core reasoning of this study. Additionally, future implications on managerial practice and academic research are explored to provide pervasive suggestions for similar attempts in different sectors. We conclude with an evaluation of the potential influence of blockchain technology on supply chain management.

AB This work proposes to exploit blockchain technology to define Access Control systems that guarantee the auditability of access control policies evaluation. The key idea of our proposal is to codify attribute-based Access Control policies as smart contracts and deploy them on a blockchain, hence transforming the policy evaluation process into a completely distributed smart contract execution. Not only the policies, but also the attributes required for their evaluation are managed by smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. The auditability property derives from the immutability and transparency properties of blockchain technology. This paper not only presents the proposed Access Control system in general, but also its application to the innovative reference scenario where the resources to be protected are themselves smart contracts. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we present a reference implementation exploiting XACML policies and Solidity written smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, we evaluate the system performances through a set of experimental results, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of our proposal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Off-chain payments are an important technique for improving the scalability of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. However, since tokens locked in off-chain channels cannot circulate from one channel to another, current off-chain payment systems have a limitation in their capacities. In this work, we present a secure large-scale instant payment (SLIP) system to improve the capacity of blockchain systems. The SLIP system uses an aggregate signature scheme to connect some of the off-chain channels such that tokens locked in these channels can circulate from one channel to the next. Therefore, the amount of circulated tokens in these channels is the sum of all locked-in tokens instead of the minimum locked-in tokens. In other words, it improves the negotiability of tokens locked in these connected off-chains channels. Besides, as payers can aggregate the signatures incrementally, payees only need to verify a line of transactions once in each transaction while nodes (miners) who maintain the blockchain system only need to verify all transactions once for all, which makes the SLIP system very efficient. We prove that if the underlying blockchain system is secure, and aggregate signature satisfies aggregate chosen-key security, then the SLIP system is secure. Finally, analyses show that the capacity of the SLIP system is much larger than the Lightning Network. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the potential of blockchain technology to empower distributed and decentralized local electricity markets. Although blockchain has gained considerable attention in the last few years as a facilitator for new electricity markets, no attention has yet been given to its potential influence on the configuration of the actors in the electricity system and its ability to transform the existing system. Based on a social network analysis, this paper investigates how blockchain can influence the actor configuration of the electricity system in the Netherlands. After describing the Dutch system, we compare the existing with the potential future system' actor configuration and the corresponding expected shifts in functions and network position of the actors. We conclude that although many functions are likely to remain and new central authorities may be formed, the impact of blockchain does not seem to be as disruptive and decentralizing as may be expected. This study provides first contributions to the ongoing discussion about the potential of blockchain to disrupt and reshape the electricity system.

TI Caterpillar: A business process execution engine on the Ethereum
   blockchain
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE blockchain; business process management system; distributed ledger;
   model-driven engineering
AB Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority and to deploy programs, called smart contracts, that are executed whenever certain transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for executing collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties. However, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast, established business process management systems (BPMSs), such as those based on the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient abstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This article demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a BPMS with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, named Caterpillar. Like any BPMN execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including subprocesses, multiple-instance activities, and event handlers. The paper describes the architecture of Caterpillar and the interfaces it provides to support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of work items, and the execution of service tasks.

AB Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains have become buzzwords in the media and are attracting increasing academic interest, mainly from the fields of computer science and financial economics. In this essay, I argue that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are important objects of general social science research and thought, but not for their 'moneyness' per se. Through a historical sociology of the antecedents and discourse leading up to Bitcoin, I show that it was never meant to be 'money' in the economic sense, but rather a solution to a technical puzzle for preventing opportunistic actors from double-spending digital 'coins,' as well as a fervent ideology surrounding online privacy and infringement of individual rights in the digital age. Drawing from themes in science and technology studies, I suggest that Bitcoin and other 'cryptoassets' are properly socio-technological assemblages that constitute new and important objects of social inquiry that must be understood beyond the myopic context of crypto-money. I conclude by proposing three alternative ontologies for blockchains relevant to economic, political, and social life: as systems of accounting, as organizational forms, and as institutions in their own right.

TI Block-DEF: A secure digital evidence framework using blockchain

AB A secure digital evidence system should ensure that evidence cannot be tampered with and that private information cannot be leaked. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant and privacy-preserving ledger, provides a promising solution for decentralized secure digital evidence systems. However, due to the huge number of digital evidences and the contradiction between the traceability and the privacy of evidence, blockchain faces big data and privacy challenges. To solve the above issues, we propose a secure digital evidence framework using blockchain (Block-DEF) with a loose coupling structure in which the evidence and the evidence information are maintained separately. Only the evidence information is stored in the blockchain, and the evidence is stored on a trusted storage platform. To avoid blockchain bloat, a lightweight blockchain combining a mixed block structure with an optimized name-based practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism is proposed. To support the traceability and the privacy of evidence, the multi-signature technique is adopted for evidence submission and retrieval. The analytical and experimental results show that Block-DEF is a scalable framework, it guarantees the integrity and validity of evidence, and balances privacy and traceability well.

AB In medical systems for patient's authentication, keeping biometric data secure is a general problem. Many studies have presented various ways of protecting biometric data especially finger vein biometric data. Thus, It is needs to find better ways of securing this data by applying the three principles of information security aforementioned, and creating a robust verification system with high levels of reliability, privacy and security. Moreover, it is very difficult to replace biometric information and any leakage of biometrics information leads to earnest risks for example replay attacks using the robbed biometric data. In this paper presented criticism and analysis to all attempts as revealed in the literature review and discussion the proposes a novel verification secure framework based confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) standard in triplex blockchain-particle swarm optimization (PSO)-advanced encryption standard (AES) techniques for medical systems patient's authentication. Three stages are performed on discussion. Firstly, proposes a new hybrid model pattern in order to increase the randomization based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and finger vein biometrics. To achieve this, proposed a new merge algorithm to combine the RFID features and finger vein features in one hybrid and random pattern. Secondly, how the propose verification secure framework are followed the CIA standard for telemedicine authentication by combination of AES encryption technique, blockchain and PSO in steganography technique based on proposed pattern model. Finally, discussed the validation and evaluation of the proposed verification secure framework.

TI PTAS: Privacy-preserving Thin-client Authentication Scheme in
   blockchain-based PKI
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE

AB Recent years have witnessed tremendous academic efforts and industry growth in Internet of Things (loT). Security issues of loT have become increasingly prominent. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can provide authentication service to loT devices which is a crucial element to the security of loT. However, the conventional PKIs are organized as a tree-like centralized structure which has demonstrated serious usability and security shortcomings such as the single point of failure. Blockchain has numerous desirable properties, such as decentralized nature, cryptographic technology and unalterable transaction record, these properties make it a potential tool to build a decentralized blockchain-based PKI. Nevertheless, the latest proposals for blockchain-based PKI did not take thin-clients into consideration where thin-clients indicate those users who cannot download the entire blockchain due to the limited storage capacity of their equipment (most loT devices fall into this category). To settle this problem, we firstly present a Privacy-preserving Thin-client Authentication Scheme (PTAS) employing the idea of private information retrieval (PIR), which enables thin-clients to run normally like full node users and protect their privacy simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to enhance security, we further propose a (m-1)-private PTAS which means thin-client's information can be protected against a collusion of at most (m-1) full node users. Besides, security analysis and functional comparison are performed to demonstrate high security and comprehensive functionality of our schemes. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to compare computational overhead and communication overhead of PTAS and (m-1)-private PTAS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ATTACKS
AB With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is an increasing demand for securing the IoT environments. For such purpose, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most important security mechanisms, which can help defend computer networks including IoT against various threats. In order to achieve better detection performance, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often adopted in a practical scenario, allowing a set of IDS nodes to exchange required information with each other, e.g., alarms, signatures. However, due to the distributed nature, such kind of collaborative network is vulnerable to insider attacks, i.e., malicious nodes can generate untruthful signatures and share to normal peers. This may cause intruders to be undetected and greatly degrade the effectiveness of IDSs. With the advent of blockchain technology, it provides a way to verify shared signatures (rules). In this work, our motivation is to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which can incrementally build and update a trusted signature database in a collaborative IoT environment. CBSigIDS can provide a verifiable manner in distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In the evaluation, our results demonstrate that CBSigIDS can enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Fork-free hybrid consensus with flexible Proof-of-Activity

AB Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain mechanism have been attracting much attention. One of their core innovations, Proof-of-Work (PoW), is notoriously inefficient which potentially motivates a centralization of hash power, defeating the original goal of decentralization. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is later proposed to replace PoW. However, both PoW and PoS have different inherent advantages and disadvantages, so does Proof-of-Activity (PoA) of Bentov et al. (SIGMETRICS 2014) which only offers limited hybrids of two mechanisms. On the other hand, the hybrid consensus protocol of Pass and Shi (DISC 2017) aims to improve the efficiency by dynamically maintaining a rotating committee. Yet, there are unsatisfactory issues including chain forks and fair committee election.
   In this paper, we firstly devise a generalized variant of PoW. After that, we leverage our generalized PoW to construct a fork-free hybrid consensus protocol. We further combine our fork-free hybrid consensus mechanism with PoS for a flexible version of PoA with tunable parameters between PoW and PoS. Compared with Bentov et al.'s PoA, our "flexible PoA" improves the efficiency, leading to a more applicable consensus protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI CReam: A Smart Contract Enabled Collusion-Resistant e-Auction

DE Blockchain; smart contract; auction theory
AB Auction is an effective way to allocate goods or services to bidders who value them the most. The rapid growth of e-auctions facilitates online transactions but poses new and distinctive challenges. It is difficult to establish trust among sellers, buyers, and auctioneers without centralized auction websites or platforms (the auctioneer) which collect bids and derive the auction results. However, these third parties may be untrustworthy, and malicious sellers or buyers may refuse to deliver the goods or payment according to the protocol. Moreover, the open and anonymous online environment may stimulate auction participants to form collusion coalitions to rig the auction and reap unfair profit. Many auction designs have been proposed to address these concerns, but they fall short of simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e., held without a trusted third utility), strong consensus (i.e., the establishment of trust), collusion resistance, and practical implementation. We present CReam, the first decentralized collusion-resistant e-auction system that is implemented with smart contract on the blockchain. With the carefully designed smart auction contract, mutually distrustful and rational sellers and buyers are stimulated to operate properly, hence transact safely without trusted third parties. The auction mechanism in the smart contract can effectively prevent bidder collusion and realize economic robustness, i.e., truthfulness. We implement a fully functional CReam on the Ethereum network. Extensive experimental results confirm that CReam can greatly reduce the probability of collusion and achieve an approximate optimal revenue at a low cost of contract execution.

TI Unblocking the chain - findings from an executive workshop on blockchain
   in the supply chain
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Innovation; Technology; Implementation; Information transparency
AB Purpose
   There is a lot of interest in blockchain in the supply chain and several papers call it a disruptive technology. Existing research, however, is mostly conceptual and focused on use-case development and early pilots. This paper aims to report the findings from a workshop with managers aimed at empirically exploring what adoption rates and focus areas are for blockchain in the supply chain, what drives blockchain in the supply chain applications and what barriers are to the implementation of blockchain in the supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A workshop with managers was organized to empirically explore blockchain adoption levels and focus areas in the supply chain, as well as drivers and barriers of implementation.
   Findings
   Workshop participants reported that adoption of blockchain in the supply chain today is very limited but actively considered by many. Drivers for this consideration include achieving greater transparency and visibility, as well as, improving processes and reducing costs. Participants identify many barriers, including a lack of understanding of costs and benefits of blockchain in the supply chain. Interestingly, participants report less concern about the feasibility of the technology implying managerial consideration if progressing beyond the technology and into the potential adoption of it. As a result, participants may be moving beyond the hype surrounding blockchain and giving consideration to the many remaining questions. A working technology does not yet mean that there is a feasible supply chain adoption. As a result, it may be too early to tell whether blockchain will be a disruptive technology. This paper identifies several fruitful areas for further consideration by management and in research.
   Originality/value
   As there is little empirical research on blockchain in the supply chain, this paper moves beyond use-case development and the exploration of pilot cases and studies how companies may consider supply chain adoption beyond the pilot and the early development of blockchain. Although only offering an initial exploration, this paper uncovers progress being reported in industry and many areas where further consideration and research can help advance thinking and practice.

AB Archives have well-established practices which have been developed over years of working with analogue records. Now they face huge challenges due to the inexorable development of digital technologies. Not only is the heterogeneous nature of the records, their instability and the rapid pace of technological development a threat to the records' survival, but the ease with which digital records can be altered has put archives in a technology arms race with those parties who would seek to falsify our digital inheritance and undermine democracy.
   In order to tackle these challenges, the ARCHANGEL project is breaking new ground by using blockchain to record checksums (cryptographic hashes) and other metadata derived from either scanned physical records or born-digital records to allow verification of their integrity over decade- or century-long time spans. This data is permanently preserved through peer-to-peer distribution and consensus checking without the need for a trusted third party, thereby enabling archives to prove the authenticity of the records in their custody.

AB Background: Nowadays, a number of mechanisms and tools are being used by health care organizations and physicians to electronically exchange the personal health information of patients. The main objectives of different methods of health information exchange (HIE) are to reduce health care costs, minimize medical errors, and improve the coordination of interorganizational information exchange across health care entities. The main challenges associated with the common HIE systems are privacy concerns, security risks, low visibility of system transparency, and lack of patient control. Blockchain technology is likely to disrupt the current information exchange models utilized in the health care industry.
   Objective: Little is known about patients' perceptions and attitudes toward the implementation of blockchain-enabled HIE networks, and it is still not clear if patients (as one of the main HIE stakeholders) are likely to opt in to the applications of this technology in HIE initiatives. Thus, this study aimed at exploring the core value of blockchain technology in the health care industry from health care consumers' views.
   Methods: To recognize the potential applications of blockchain technology in health care practices, we designed 16 information exchange scenarios for controlled Web-based experiments. Overall, 2013 respondents participated in 16 Web-based experiments. Each experiment described an information exchange condition characterized by 4 exchange mechanisms (ie, direct, lookup, patient-centered, and blockchain), 2 types of health information (ie, sensitive vs nonsensitive), and 2 types of privacy policy (weak vs strong).
   Results: The findings show that there are significant differences in patients' perceptions of various exchange mechanisms with regard to patient privacy concern, trust in competency and integrity, opt-in intention, and willingness to share information. Interestingly, participants hold a favorable attitude toward the implementation of blockchain-based exchange mechanisms for privacy protection, coordination, and information exchange purposes. This study proposed the potentials and limitations of a blockchain-based attempt in the HIE context.
   Conclusions: The results of this research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The findings propose potential limitations of a blockchain-based HIE that should be addressed by health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure and private manner. This study can contribute to the research in the blockchain area and enrich the literature on the use of blockchain in HIE efforts. Practitioners can also identify how to leverage the benefit of blockchain to promote HIE initiatives nationwide.

AB In this paper, two series of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)-b-poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PSBMA-b-PLMA) diblock copolymers were prepared to investigate the core-shell reversion of amphiphilic copolymers. Experimental results proved that the PSBMA-b-PLMA copolymers can be self-assembled as core-shell nanoparticles in chloroform. Moreover, H-1 NMR spectra and contact angle measurements revealed that there is a transitional PSBMA/PLMA block ratio of 0.6, above which the nanoparticles are capable of switching their core and shell in aqueous solution. Consequently, nanoparticles with PSBMA/PLMA block ratios above 0.6 showed superior antifouling and antibacterial abilities to those with block ratios below 0.4. Moreover, it was also found that the block chain length plays an important role in core-shell reversion as evidenced by H-1 NMR spectra, water contact angle, and antifouling tests. As a result, coatings fabricated with the PLMA(100) series of nanoparticles showed better antifouling abilities than those of the PLMA(150) series at the same block ratio probably because of the thinner shell of PLMA(100) copolymers. PSBMA(100)-b-PLMA(100) was proved to be the best candidate for the fabrication of antifouling coatings as it exhibited the highest efficacy in antibacterial adhesion and antiprotein adsorption. This study provided a facile method to fabricate antifouling coatings by developing amphiphilic diblock copolymers with tuned hydrophobic/hydrophilic block ratio, block chain length, etc.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the enabling and constraining roles of blockchain technology (BCT) in managerial work practices and conceptualise the technology-performance relationship in supply chain management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach A structured literature review and a theory-driven approach are used. A set of propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of BCT in supply chains can be understood to simultaneously enable and constrain SCM and performance. Findings The analysis identifies four enabling and three constraining blockchain identities to explain how the technology either "facilitates" or "impedes" SCM and supply chain performance. Traceability, which emanates from its ability to provide data immutability, ranks highly as a core innovation of the technology. The blockchain is mainly seen as an opportunity to exploit existing supply chain resources and competencies. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of the research is its conceptual nature. Future research should test the developed propositions empirically. Further research should focus on BCT as an opportunity to explore and as a relationship-building technology. More research is also needed focussing on the complex and simultaneous enabling and constraining effects of BCT in supply chains. Originality/value The paper shows the important and complex Janus-faced implications of embedding BCT in supply chains and demonstrates how organisational theory can be applied to explore the relationship between blockchain and SCM.

AB Background: Distributed ledger technology (DLT) holds great potential to improve health information exchange. However, the immutable and transparent character of this technology may conflict with data privacy regulations and data processing best practices. Objective: The aim of this paper is to develop a proof-of-concept system for immutable, interoperable, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-compliant exchange of blood glucose data.
   Methods: Given that there is no ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT) and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4) file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity.
   Results: The public IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), but involved a relatively higher setup complexity.
   Conclusions: For the specific use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data exchange system.

AB Recently, the applications of Blockchain technology have begun to revolutionise different aspects of supply chain (SC) management. Among others, Blockchain is a platform to execute the smart contracts in the SC as transactions. We develop and test a new model for smart contract design in the SC with multiple logistics service providers and show that this problem can be presented as a multi-processor flexible flow shop scheduling. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the execution of physical operations is modelled inside the start and completion of cyber information services. We name this modelling concept 'virtual operation'. The constructed model and the developed experimental environment constitute an event-driven dynamic approach to task and service composition when designing the smart contract. Our approach is also of value when considering the contract execution stage. The use of state control variables in our model allows for operations status updates in the Blockchain that in turn, feeds automated information feedbacks, disruption detection and control of contract execution. The latter launches the re-scheduling procedure, comprehensively combining planning and adaptation decisions within a unified methodological framework of dynamic control theory. The modelling complex developed can be used to design and control smart contracts in the SC.

AB Purpose This paper aims to encourage the study of blockchain technology from an operations and supply chain management (OSCM) perspective, identifying potential areas of application, and to provide an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach An explanation and analysis of blockchain technology is provided to identify implications for the field of OSCM. Findings The hype around the opportunities that digital ledger technologies offer is high. For OSCM, a myriad of ways in which blockchain could transform practice are identified, including enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management; reducing illegal counterfeiting; improving sustainable supply chain management; advancing inventory management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new product design and development; and reducing the cost of supply chain transactions. The immature state of practice and research surrounding blockchain means there is an opportunity for OSCM researchers to study the technology in its early stages and shape its adoption.
   Originality/value This is one of the first papers in a leading international OSCM journal to analyse blockchain technology, thereby complementing a recent article on digital supply chains that omitted blockchain.

AB Background: Huge amounts of health-related data are generated every moment with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technologies. These big health data contain great value and can bring benefit to all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Currently, most of these data are siloed and fragmented in different health care systems or public and private databases. It prevents the fulfillment of intelligent health care inspired by these big data. Security and privacy concerns and the lack of ensured authenticity trails of data bring even more obstacles to health data sharing. With a decentralized and consensus-driven nature, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) provide reliable solutions such as blockchain, Ethereum, and IOTA Tangle to facilitate the health care data sharing.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a health-related data sharing system by integrating IoT and DLT to enable secure, fee-less, tamper-resistant, highly-scalable, and granularly-controllable health data exchange, as well as build a prototype and conduct experiments to verify the feasibility of the proposed solution.
   Methods: The health-related data are generated by 2 types of IoT devices: wearable devices and stationary air quality sensors. The data sharing mechanism is enabled by IOTA's distributed ledger, the Tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph. Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is adopted to facilitate data communications among different parties. Merkle Hash Tree is used for data encryption and verification.
   Results: A prototype system was built according to the proposed solution. It uses a smartwatch and multiple air sensors as the sensing layer; a smartphone and a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) as the gateway; and a local server for data publishing. The prototype was applied to the remote diagnosis of tremor disease. The results proved that the solution could enable costless data integrity and flexible access management during data sharing.
   Conclusions: DLT integrated with IoT technologies could greatly improve the health-related data sharing. The proposed solution based on IOTA Tangle and MAM could overcome many challenges faced by other traditional blockchain-based solutions in terms of cost, efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in data access management. This study also showed the possibility of fully decentralized health data sharing by replacing the local server with edge computing devices.

AB Recently, blockchain technology has gained considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. This is mainly due to its unique features including decentralization, security, reliability, and data integrity. Despite this growing interest, little is known about the current state of knowledge and practice regarding the use of blockchain technology in education. This article is a systematic review of research investigating blockchain-based educational applications. It focuses on three main themes: (1) educational applications that have been developed with blockchain technology, (2) benefits that blockchain technology could bring to education, and (3) challenges of adopting blockchain technology in education.

AB In this paper, we present a badge awarding system for performance assessment in education using blockchain technology. Learners will be awarded badges, which are certified for a predetermined level of progress in terms of learning. All the badges are stored in a backpack, which is an environment for storing and presenting the obtained badges. Badges are immutable and verifiable as well as rigid. The use of badges in the education system makes education more interesting, skill-based, and adaptable to changes. The key contribution of our work is in terms of compatibility with Openbadge specification and integrated cooperating platform between digital badge awarding and blockchaining. Our system implementation is compatible with Open Badges of IMS Global Learning Consortium, which is used to earn, issue, and award badges across various platforms. The badges are trusted by the IMS standard, the criteria to earn a badge is verified through the network, and the overall process is transparent compared to the traditional education system. Moreover, all badge awarding events in our system are recorded in a blockchain. Once stored, the contents cannot be tampered with. Thereafter, anyone can check the validity of the badge through the blockchain. Our platform will be useful for distance learning as well as time and location independent learning. The experimental results are as follows. On a Bitcoin-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time required to award the badge is 24.53 s, while on the Ethereum-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time to award the badge is only 3.86 s. It can also be used for career management and personal history. The learners can obtain the current knowledge required for a job. Lifelong learning will be also possible with this platform.

AB A crucial role is played by personal biomedical data when it comes to maintaining proficient access to health records by patients as well as health professionals. However, it is difficult to get a unified view pertaining to health data that have been scattered across various health centers/hospital sections. To be specific, health records are distributed across many places and cannot be integrated easily. In recent years, blockchain has arisen as a promising solution that helps to achieve the sharing of individual biomedical information in a secure way, whilst also having the benefit of privacy preservation because of its immutability. This research puts forward a blockchain-based managing scheme that helps to establish interpretation improvements pertaining to electronic biomedical systems. In this scheme, two blockchains were employed to construct the base, whereby the second blockchain algorithm was used to generate a secure sequence for the hash key that was generated in first blockchain algorithm. This adaptive feature enables the algorithm to use multiple data types and also combines various biomedical images and text records. All data, including keywords, digital records, and the identity of patients, are private key encrypted with a keyword searching function so as to maintain data privacy, access control, and a protected search function. The obtained results, which show a low latency (less than 750 ms) at 400 requests/second, indicate the possibility of its use within several health care units such as hospitals and clinics.

TI Evaluating Methods for the Identification of Off-Chain Transactions in

AB Payment channels and off-chain transactions are used to address blockchain scalability. Those mechanisms rely on the blockchain proper, as the resolution mechanism. They allow for high transaction throughput due to the pure peer-to-peer nature of the transaction exchange that happens directly between the peers, without the involvement of the blockchain transactions. The transactions are not mediated through the blockchain but happen off-chain. The transactions in such overlay networks are not included in the blockchain, they nevertheless leave some data traces in a public ledger. We have used the Bitcoin mainnet and testnet blockchains together with the Lightning network node to explore what can be inferred from the underlying blockchain in the context of Lightning transactions, channel setup, and channel teardown. The main purpose of this study is to identify what methods, transaction signatures, and data can be used to understand the non-visible publicly off-chain transactions. We have proposed heuristics for identifying the setup and teardown transactions, quantified and analyzed the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Using the data from the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as the data from the Lightning network to link related information we have found when parsing the blockchain, we generate network graph representations showing the relationships between the Lightning network channels identified on the blockchain. This study is significant from the personal data and privacy perspectives, as well as from forensics. We have established that at least 75% of all P2WSH transactions are Lightning transactions, and some of the channels can be deduced from the blockchain analysis. The synthesized results demonstrate that our methods are viable for identifying a subset of transactions and that only partial topology of the payment channels can be obtained from the data left in the blockchain.

TI A Personalized QoS Prediction Method for Web Services via

AB Personalized quality of service (QoS) prediction plays an important role in helping users build high-quality service-oriented systems. To obtain accurate prediction results, many approaches have been investigated in recent years. However, these approaches do not fully address untrustworthy QoS values submitted by unreliable users, leading to inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, inspired by blockchain with distributed ledger technology, distributed consensus mechanisms, encryption algorithms, etc., we propose a personalized QoS prediction method for web services that we call blockchain-based matrix factorization (BMF). We develop a user verification approach based on homomorphic hash, and use the Byzantine agreement to remove unreliable users. Then, matrix factorization is employed to improve the accuracy of predictions and we evaluate the proposed BMF on a real-world web services dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, making it much more effective than traditional techniques.

AB The blockchain is an emerging technology that allows multiple parties to agree on a common state without the need for trusted intermediaries. Moreover, business process technology streamlines the automation of inter- and intra-organizational processes while cutting-down on costs. With the new business opportunities provided by blockchains, it becomes vital to combine both technologies to allow the modeling and execution of blockchain-based interactions within business processes. However, the existing business process modeling languages lack support to intuitively model the various interactions with blockchains. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a business process modeling extension that captures the particularities of blockchains. We also show how to transform the proposed constructs into standard-compliant models, and we present an integration architecture that allows external applications, to communicate with the blockchains. Finally, we validate our approach by providing a prototypical implementation that proves its practical feasibility.

AB Many organizations are looking at blockchain technologies. However, the drawbacks of blockchain databases (e.g., scalability, capacity, latency, privacy) mean that the technology is not always appropriate. This article presents a ten-step decision path that can help determine whether the application of blockchain is justified and, if so, which kind of blockchain technology to use. We describe how this decision path was used to develop a blockchain prototype for the Danish maritime shipping industry.(1)

AB This Practitioner's Note considers the disruptive function of Little Phil, a mobile app that seeks to democratize philanthropic giving. Although many of the cultural aspects of philanthropy - such as increased control over donation, tracking the impact of one's giving, and building interpersonal relationships with receivers - can be opened to any person with an app-hosting device and internet access, it cannot supplant the role of big philanthropy and solve Rob Reich's problem: how to domesticate private wealth so that it serves democratic purposes? Little Phil's disruption has in concept gotten us halfway to legitimizing philanthropy. Perhaps the uptake of citizens' panels by large philanthropic foundations will cover the remaining distance.

DT Article
DE Digital forensics; blockchain; evidence integrity
AB This paper examines the way in which blockchain technology can be used to improve the verification of integrity of evidence in digital forensics. Some background into digital forensic practices and blockchain technology are discussed to provide necessary context. A particular scalable method of verifying point-in-time existence of a piece of digital evidence, using the OpenTimestamps (OTS) service, is described, and tests are carried out to independently validate the claims made by the service. The results demonstrate that the OTS service is highly reliable with a zero false positive and false negative error rate for timestamp attestations, but that it is not suitable for time-sensitive timestamping due to the variance of the accuracy of timestamps induced by block confirmation times in the Bitcoin blockchain.

LA English
DT Article
AB That technology increasingly impacts everything that is linked to law-from access to law, legal education, the services provided by the legal industry, and, increasingly, even adjudication (in-court or via alternative dispute resolution)-is a fact. The role that technology plays in these contexts varies, yet one may safely presume that the influence will intensify. In order to reflect on the future, this article canvasses and tries to draw some conclusions based on the comparison of accessibility to foreign and local law in the hard copy versus the digital and Internet-based, as well as the recently unfolding era of algorithms. The examples range from the curious encounter of Central and Eastern European socialist enterprises and law students with punitive damages and strict tortious liability known in the USA through the most recent launching of the first transnational letter of credit transaction exploiting blockchain technology. The advancements generated by technology advancements in these three stages are then reflected upon primarily from the perspectives of (i) researchers and lecturers of law as well as legal education; (ii) company boards and managements (especially foreign market-oriented business firms) formulating their business policies; and (iii) regulators as well as law and policymakers. The article concludes with thoughts on the broader implications of enhanced access to law. In particular, it posits that technology has made the shift from 'mechanical' to 'analytic access to law' possible. Yet it also raises the more fundamental question of whether the advancements denote, and the selected examples properly illustrate, that a more fundamental shift is unfolding: a shift from governance by law to governance by technology?

SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW

DT Article
ID BITCOIN; LAW
AB This article investigates the twofold impact that blockchain technologies and smart contracts have on dispute resolution. On the one hand, these technologies enable private parties to devise arbitral systems that are self-enforcing and, therefore, largely bypass the recognition and enforcement procedures through which State courts traditionally exert a certain control over arbitration. This phenomenon may in the future allow arbitration to become entirely self-sufficient, thus leading to the marginalization of State courts. On the other hand, however, such a marginalization has not taken place yet; to the contrary, the recent blockchain-related phenomenon of initial coin offerings has given rise to some prominent court cases. These cases raise particularly interesting jurisdictional questions, especially in light of the difficulty of reconciling the decentralized nature of the blockchain with the territorial approach whereby jurisdiction is typically allocated among national courts.

AB This paper interprets the principles of good governance and corporate governance in the context of distributed ledger technologies, namely blockchain, analyzing specifically how these principles apply to a blockchain-enabled energy market. With blockchain, governance becomes decentralized and automated, creating a new, technical bureaucracy. However, a programmed decision tree does not inevitably produce a digitized democracy and a functional marketplace. While blockchain governance decisions have been predominantly technical, they increasingly embroil legal, moral, cultural and even philosophical considerations. As a result, governance is increasingly recognized as a critical challenge in the future development of blockchain-enabled marketplaces. Future, multidisciplinary research by lawyers, engineers, political scientists and philosophers should venture further into developing good governance principles for blockchain, focusing on equity and inclusion.

AB In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in distributed energy resources. This transformation has rendered the grid more bidirectional and transformed many small consumers into prosumers. However, these small power producers are not able to optimize their revenue since, currently, they can only sell to local energy suppliers or opt to sell at a fixed feed-in tariff. If intermediaries are eliminated from energy trading, both individual buyers and prosumers can increase their profitability. Blockchain technology could facilitate this scenario. In this paper, the simulated environment of a hierarchical energy trading market using Ethereum's smart-contract technology is created as a proof-of-concept of using blockchain technology in energy trading. A dynamic grid fee based on electrical network loading is calculated to demonstrate an economic incentive for agents to have flexible load demand as well as to promote local resource utilization. The price volatility of cryptocurrency is addressed by designing a specific energy token for the model.

TI Community energy retail tariffs in Singapore: opportunities for

ID REGULATORY FRAMEWORK; ELECTRICITY MARKET; SMART; POWER
AB The deregulation of Singapore's retail electricity market in 2018 and the rapid adoption of solar rooftops have led to the emergence of a new type of energy transaction, wherein prosumers require flexible tariffs that reflect their willingness to respond to market price signals as well as new business models. The move toward community energy schemes, where prosumers can trade their surplus electricity locally, and the implications this has for tariff design motivates our study. We propose a portfolio of stylized retail tariffs for different market organizations. Among the proposed configurations are time-of-use (ToU), default vertical and peer-to-peer (P2P) tariffs, the last of which operates through a blockchain platform. In this study, each Singaporean district is balanced as a potential future microgrid. An iterative double-auction mechanism is designed to calculate a distributed P2P tariff, looking to maximize the benefit for stakeholders. This tariff is then cleared and compared with a bespoke retail ToU tariff as well as Singapore's monopolistic regulated vertical tariff.

AB Our study on smart contracts, self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology, can be placed in the field of inquiry within law and economics of contracts which explores new modes of contract enforcement as sources of market creation. We lay the foundations by characterising contract enforcement and trust mechanisms underlying contracts. Considering that trust reduces risks in economic exchange, we explain how the particular trust mechanism underlying smart contracts' enforcement (no-party trust) provides opportunities for creating new markets and changing existing ones. We explore, among other things, whether using smart contracts could be a path to increasing the autonomy of consumers and offering a solution for democratising trade.

TI Blockchain Technology and Financial Regulation: A Risk-Based Approach to
   the Regulation of ICOs
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC OFFERINGS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT
AB This paper compares Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and equity crowdfunding with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and explores the corresponding risks and limitations of these different fundraising practices, with a view to analysing the extent to which the latter should be subject to the same regulatory framework as the former. After assessing the underlying principles and current regulatory framework for IPOs and equity crowdfunding, with a focus on Europe and the US, we investigate the possibility of applying existing financial regulations to ICOs. Drawing from the notion of "functional equivalence", we contend that many ICOs share a sufficient number of similarities with traditional IPOs and equity crowdfunding, to be regulated in a similar manner. However, given the various attempts by token issuers to escape from the scope of securities laws by assigning a different function to their ICOs tokens, we argue that principle-based regulation based on an in-depth risk-analysis could be an effective way of addressing the regulation of ICOs, thereby moving from "functional equivalence" to "risk equivalence". Finally, we explore the use of blockchain technology as a regulatory technology, incorporating specific rules and constraints into the technological fabric of an ICO, in order to ensure compliance with the fundamental principles of financial regulation.

TI How to Make Sure My Cryptokitties Are Here Forever? The Complementary
   Roles of Blockchain and the Law to Bring Trust
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Under the phrase "code is law" and based on its "trustless trust", blockchain has emerged as a disrupting technology considered by some as an alternative to the law. Based on a study of real-life blockchain-based decentralised applications (Dapps), this article takes blockchain developers at their word and adopts the point of view of users: can blockchain live up to its promise and enable them to transact with each other without the need for the trust granted by the law? The article particularly highlights that users need to be able to ascertain that a self-advertised Dapp indeed qualifies as one. Blockchain technology may make it possible to do away with trust in third parties, but this is not enough. Users also need to trust that an alleged Dapp genuinely is one, and blockchain alone cannot provide this. Beyond Dapps, it is argued that blockchain needs the complementary role of the law to deliver its promises and especially to authenticate blockchain "virtues". The EU certification mark is identified as a promising form of co-regulation for that purpose.

TI Blockchain-Based Voting in the US and EU Constitutional Orders: A
   Digital Technology to Secure Democratic Values?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
ID VOTER IDENTIFICATION LAWS; UNITED-STATES; GOVERNANCE; PARTICIPATION;
   ELECTIONS; POLITICS; JUSTICE
AB The right to vote and participate in the political process is a quintessential feature of any democratic society. Systematic risks to the integrity of US elections and passive civic participation in the EU political process present fundamental threats to the constitutional aspirations and the democratic ideals connected to "We the People" in the US and "United in Diversity" in the EU. The existence of power imbalances, social inequalities and information asymmetries in electoral and political processes illustrate that both jurisdictions are in peril and in risk of democratic backsliding. Blockchain-based voting can transform existing electoral and political processes in the digital age. This raises the question whether blockchain-based voting can be utilised as a digital tool to enhance the democratic legitimacy of US and EU electoral and political systems. Accordingly, this article aims to examine the prospects and limits of blockchain technology to secure foundational democratic norms connected to the right to vote and civic participation at the heart of contemporary constitutionalism. It contends that the decentralised, immutable, accessible, transparent, and secure processes of blockchain technology have the potential to enhance the legitimacy of the US and EU constitutional orders, since blockchain-based voting can act as a forum for enhanced civic participation, public deliberation, and democratic contestation. Nevertheless, the article concludes that a number of important steps must be taken to fully realise the potential of blockchain-based voting in a manner that combats the risks associated with the technology, strengthens public confidence in electoral and political processes and secures a balanced system of governance in the US and the EU constitutional orders.

TI Why do Public Blockchains Need Formal and Effective Internal Governance
   Mechanisms?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
AB With the birth and rise of cryptocurrencies following the success of Bitcoin and the popularity of "Initial Coin Offerings", public awareness of blockchain technologies has substantially increased in recent years. Many blockchain advocates claim that these software artefacts enable radically new forms of decentralised governance by relying upon computational trust created via cryptographic proof, obviating the need for reliance on conventional trusted third-party intermediaries. But these claims rest on some key assumptions, which this paper subjects to critical examination. It asks: can existing mechanisms and procedures for collective decision-making of public blockchains (which we refer to as internal blockchain governance) live up to these ambitions? By drawing upon HLA Hart's Concept of Law, together with literature from regulatory governance studies, we argue that unless public blockchain systems establish formal and effective internal governance, they are unlikely to be taken up at scale as a tool for social coordination, and are thus likely to remain, at best, a marginal technology.

AB The environment of ocean having special conditions is at risk of frequent accidents. For safer use of ocean environment, the whole world is attempting to graft the state-of-the-art technology with the introduction of lots of institutions such as international treaties. In the meantime, with the development of the state-of-the-art IT technology and increase in superhigh speed network establishment, the era of the Internet of Things is opening, and there are increasing cases of fusion with IT in the ocean area. Accordingly, at a time when security for data is especially required, blockchain technology is one of the major alternatives. This study examined application possibility and limits of blockchain technology through ocean space information's security treatment experiment utilizing blockchain technology. For the experiment, GML data which has S-10X electric navigation chart standard structure was used. The experiment results suggested that descrambling of ocean space information utilizing blockchain technology was successfully conducted for safe protection, and it is expected that it would be utilized for ocean space information of other types.

AB In this study, we investigate the existence of chaos in the global cryptocurrency market. Specifically, we analyze parameters of chaotic order, nonlinearity, sensitivity to the initial conditions, monofractality, and multifractality. For this purpose, we conduct a comprehensive series of tests, including Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman (BDS) test, largest Lyapunov exponent, box-counting, and monogram analysis for fractal dimension, and multiple tests for long-range dependence (Aggregated Variances, Peng, Higuchi, R/S Analysis, and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)). All tests are performed over a variety of major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. The empirical results support the existence of chaos in the cryptocurrency market. Accordingly, cryptocurrency returns are not random and follow a chaotic order. Therefore, long term predictions are not possible, contrary to most of the discussions ongoing in the media and the public.

AB The probability of successfully spending twice the same bitcoins is considered. A double-spending attack consists in issuing two transactions transferring the same bitcoins. The first transaction, from the fraudster to a merchant, is included in a block of the public chain. The second transaction, from the fraudster to himself, is recorded in a block that integrates a private chain, exact copy of the public chain up to substituting the fraudster-to-merchant transaction by the fraudster-to-fraudster transaction. The double-spending hack is completed once the private chain reaches the length of the public chain, in which case it replaces it. The growth of both chains are modelled by two independent counting processes. The probability distribution of the time at which the malicious chain catches up with the honest chain, or, equivalently, the time at which the two counting processes meet each other, is studied. The merchant is supposed to await the discovery of a given number of blocks after the one containing the transaction before delivering the goods. This grants a head start to the honest chain in the race against the dishonest chain.

ID GROSS SETTLEMENT
AB In this paper, we aim to provide an interpretation of the legal issue of settlement finality in the context of proof-of-work distributed ledger technology, such as the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin intends to achieve certainty of settlement of its cryptocurrency in a trustless environment, without the need for intermediaries and without recourse to any legal provision. We extend earlier work on functional modeling of the theoretical settlement problem to include blockchains, and we provide a functional interpretation of settlement finality by introducing the notion of degree of settlement finality. In principle, we conclude that functional settlement finality in Bitcoin is preferred to legal enforceability. However, in practice, the Bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for the trusted environment of the regulated financial industry unless well-known issues - such as high energy consumption, low settlement speed, problems with scalability and the 51% attack risk - are resolved.

TI Introducing Multi Shippers Mechanism for Decentralized Cash on Delivery
   System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; smart contract; Cash on Delivery (COD); hyperledger fabric
AB One of the major problems of e-commerce globally is the selling and buying of goods among the parties over the Internet in which the traders may not trust their partners. Cash on delivery allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their home or a location they choose. This is sometimes called a payment system because customers receive goods before making a payment. This paper investigates a critical verification process issue in the cash on delivery system. In particular, we propose a multi shippers mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and trustworthy verification across participants in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism is given to not only ensure the benefits of the seller but also prevent shipper's fraudulent. The solution leverages the consistency and robustness of decentralized markets where trust is flexible and effectively controlled. To demonstrate the application and implementation of the proposed framework, we conduct several case studies on real-world transaction datasets from a local computer retailer. We also provide our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. Our conclusion is that the continued integration of multi-shipper mechanism and blockchain technology in the decentralized markets will cause significant transformations across several disciplines.

DE Healthcare; blockchain; electronic health record; identity management;
   Health Level Seven (HL7)
AB Healthcare record sharing among various medical roles is a critical and challenging research problem especially in today's everchanging global IT solutions. The emergence of blockchain as a new enabling technology brought radical changes to numerous business applications, including healthcare. Blockchain is a trusted distributed ledger that forms a decentralized infrastructure. There have been several proposals regarding the sharing of critical healthcare records over blockchain infrastructure without requiring prior knowledge/trust of the parties involved (patients, service providers, and insurance companies). Another yet important issue is to securely share medical records across various countries for travelling patients to ensure an integrated and ubiquitous healthcare service. In this paper, we present a globally integrated healthcare record sharing architecture based on blockchain and HL7 client. Healthcare records are stored at the hosting country and are not stored on the blockchain. This architecture avails medical records of travelling patients temporarily and after performing necessary authentication. The actual authorisation process is performed on a federated identity management system, such as, the Shibboleth. Though there are similarities with identity management systems, our system is unique as it involves the patient in the permission process and discloses to them the identities of entities accessed their health records. Our solution also improves performance and guarantees privacy and security through the use of blockchain and identity management system.

   OUTLOOK
AB Blockchain Technology (BCT) is a growing digital technology that in recent years has gained widespread traction in various industries in the public and private sectors. BCT is a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a block', the body of which is comprised of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. BCT was introduced as the working mechanism that forms the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized data exchange technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. BCT aims at creating a system that would offer a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring, and cyber-resilient data transaction operation, assuring the facilitation and protection of a truly efficient data exchange system. In the state of Florida, climate change and unpredicted weather disasters have put pressure on state and local decision-makers to adapt quick and efficient post-disaster recovery systems. Part of the recovery efforts is the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure. The introduction of new technologies in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry can contribute to addressing recovery and rebuilding after the event of a natural disaster. With parallel technological advancement in geospatial data and Geographic Information System (GIS), as well as worsening climatic conditions, concerns can be suitably addressed by employing an integrated system of both Building Information Modeling (BIM) and BCT. While several potential applications of BIM must provide solutions to disaster-related issues, few have seen practical applications in recent years that indicate the potential benefits of such implementations. The feasibility of BIM-based applications still rests on the reliability of connectivity and cyber-security, indicating a strong use case for using BCT in conjunction with BIM for post-disaster recovery. This research depicts a survey of BCT and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries and examines the potential incorporation within the BIM process to address post-disaster rebuilding problems. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the building permitting process using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. The study proposes a new conceptualized framework resulting from the integration of BCT and BIM processes to improve the efficiency of building permit processes in post-disaster events.

ID TRUST MANAGEMENT; CARE
AB Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a need-to-know basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (naive, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

AB Recently, there have been increasing calls for healthcare providers to provide controls for patients over their personal health records. Nevertheless, security issues concerning how different healthcare providers exchange healthcare information have caused a flop in the deployment of such systems. The ability to exchange data securely is important so that new borderless integrated healthcare services can be provided to patients. Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology is a suitable driver for the much-needed shift towards integrated healthcare, providing new insights and addressing some of the main challenges of many healthcare areas. Blockchain allows healthcare providers to record and manage peer-to-peer transactions through a network without central authority. In this paper, we discuss the concept of blockchain technology and hurdles in their adoption in the healthcare domain. Furthermore, a review is conducted on the latest implementations of blockchain technology in healthcare. Finally, a new case study of a blockchain-based healthcare platform is presented addressing the drawbacks of current designs, followed by recommendations for future blockchain researchers and developers.

AB In this paper, we present a certificate management platform for performance assessment during recruitment using blockchain. Applicants are awarded certificates according to a predetermined level of progress based on their performances. All certificates are stored on a recruitment management platform that serves as an environment for storing and presenting all awarded certificates. The hashed information of all the certificates are stored in the blockchain, and once stored, the contents cannot be tampered with. Therefore, anyone can check the validity of the certificates using this blockchain. Our proposed platform will be useful for recruitment and application management, career management, and personal history maintenance.

AB Scholarly communication is today immersed in publish-or-perish culture that propels non-cooperative behavior in the sense of strategic games played by researchers. Here we introduce and describe a blockchain based platform for decentralized scholarly communication. The design of the platform rests on community driven publishing reviewing processes and implements cryptoeconomic incentives that promote cooperative user behavior. The key to achieve cooperation in blockchain based scholarly communication is to transform today's static research paper into a modifiable research paper under continuous peer review process. We introduce and discuss the implementation of a modifiable research paper as a smart contract on the blockchain.

AB Blockchain prospers in a second mining fever long after the one that occurred in the 1840s. Assumed to be an ark carrying all the data into the brave new world, blockchain provides limited tickets that all the miners struggled to win. Ultimate resources have been wasted to involve the proof-of-work game in order to dig up bitcoins even in countries of the third world. So we strive to design another storage structure with self-destructing mechanism that can provide high-efficiency concurrency and which is more important security for all the users and all types of data. The data would vanish after expiration that could be set by the user in this structure named Bead Strand Model, and this humanitarian mechanism makes it more acceptable than blockchain by the people who concerned privacy and security in cloud environment.

TI Smart contracts for smart rural supply chains

   blockchain; rural development
ID MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY; NETWORKS; M2M
AB Rural economy is often associated with small firm size together with low level of business sophistication, thin business networks, limited ability to attract investments, regional orientation and weakness in entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, there are strong activities towards smart rural development by applying recent advances in information technology (IT) to foster new development paths of Europe's rural areas. A new and promising IT invention is related to blockchain technology and smart contracts, i.e. to computerized transaction protocols intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and execution of the terms of an underlying legal contract designed to fulfil common contractual conditions comprising payments, legal obligations, and enforcement without third party. But the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organizational business-processes in the context of smart rural supply chains.
   An analysis of existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to industrial solutions. But a closer look to all successfully applied cases of blockchain technology and smart contracts also shows high potential for integrating fragmented rural supply and value chains towards smart rural development. Hence, one important development perspective lies in the use of digitalization approaches to overcome rural shortcomings in rural networks of small and medium enterprises (SME) and value chains by coordinating and optimizing their supply chains and to market their products in order to reduce or even avoid the dependency of multinational agricultural commodity traders.
   This paper discusses the research question how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can be applied to empower rural SME in smart rural supply chains. The research results will be empirically validated by two case studies from the area of smart supply chains in a rural context.

AB A blockchain based system integrity (BCSI) framework for assuring the integrity of information system processes is presented. BCSI is well suited for a broad class of large scale real-world information systems. Under the BCSI framework, the integrity of any information system I is assured by executing the finite state machine model for system I processes in a blockchain network. The BCSI framework is compared and contrasted with the Clark-Wilson (CW) system integrity model, and existing blockchain based frameworks like Ethereum.

AB Data sharing and privacy securing present extensive opportunities and challenges in vehicular network. This paper introduces 'trust access authentication scheme' as a mechanism to achieve real-time monitoring and promote collaborative sharing for vehicles. Blockchain, which can provide secure authentication and protected privacy, is a crucial technology. However, traditional cloud computing performs poorly in supplying low-latency and fast-response services for moving vehicles. In this situation, edge computing enabled Blockchain network appeals to be a promising method, where moving vehicles can access storage or computing resource and get authenticated from Blockchain edge nodes directly. In this paper, a hierarchical architecture is proposed consist of vehicular network layer, Blockchain edge layer and Blockchain network layer. Through a authentication mechanism adopting digital signature algorithm, it achieves trusted authentication and ensures valid verification. Moreover, a caching scheme based on many-to-many matching is proposed to minimize average delivery delay of vehicles. Simulation results prove that the proposed caching scheme has a better performance than existing schemes based on centralized model or edge caching strategy in terms of hit ratio and average delay.

ID INCENTIVE MECHANISM
AB Mobile crowdsensing(MCS) is an emerging pattern which means task initiators attract mobile users sensing with their own devices by some platforms. MCS could exploit idle resources in low cost, while it has lots of flaws, which impede its developments. First, isolations between different MCS systems leads to wastage of social resources. What's more, current MCS always operate in a centralized way, which causes it vulnerable and unbelievable. Blockchain is a promising technology which could supply a credible and transparent environment. This paper construct a blockchain based MCS market and design smart contract for its operation. In our design, platform breaks isolation by blockchain, task initiators and mobile users manage their tasks by smart contract and bargain price with distributed algorithm. By this way, resource could be exploited better, and the market could be more fair. What's more, the paper analyzes Walrasian Equilibrium (WE) in the market, and details how to deploy MCS in blockchain. Evalution results shows that Equilibrium could be found.

AB Software defined optical networking (SDON) is a critical technology for the next generation network with the advantages of programmable control and etc. As one of the key issues of SDON, the security of control plane has also received extensive attention, especially in certain network scenarios with high security requirement. Due to the existence of vulnerabilities and heavy overhead, the existing firewalls and distributed control technologies cannot solve the control plane security problem well. In this paper, we propose a distributed control architecture for SDON using the blockchain technique (BlockCtrl). The proposed BlockCtrl model introduces the advantages of blockchain into SDON to achieve a high-efficiency fault tolerant control. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it to the existing models with respect to various metrics including processing rate, recovery latency and etc. The numerical results show that the BlockCtrl is capable of attacks detection and fault tolerant control in SDON with high performance on resource utilization and service correlation.

AB Blockchain is a technology that uses community validation to keep synchronized the content of ledgers replicated across multiple users, which is the underlying technology of digital currency like bitcoin. The anonymity of blockchain has caused widespread concern. In this paper, we put forward AABN, an Anonymity Assessment model based on Bayesian Network. Firstly, we investigate and analyze the anonymity assessment techniques, and focus on typical anonymity assessment schemes. Then the related concepts involved in the assessment model are introduced and the model construction process is described in detail. Finally, the anonymity in the MIX anonymous network is quantitatively evaluated using the methods of accurate reasoning and approximate reasoning respectively, and the anonymity assessment experiments under different output strategies of the MIX anonymous network are analyzed.

DT Article
DE blockchain; privacy protection; zero-knowledge proof algorithm; account
   and multi-asset model
AB The blockchain technology has been applied to wide areas. However, the open and transparent properties of the blockchains pose serious challenges to users' privacy. Among all the schemes for the privacy protection, the zero-knowledge proof algorithm conceals most of the private information in a transaction, while participants of the blockchain can validate this transaction without the private information. However, current schemes are only aimed at blockchains with the UTXO model, and only one type of assets circulates on these blockchains. Based on the zero-knowledge proof algorithm, this paper proposes a privacy protection scheme for blockchains that use the account and multi-asset model. We design the transaction structure, anonymous addresses and anonymous asset metadata, and also propose the methods of the asset transfer and double-spending detection. The zk-SNARKs algorithm is used to generate and to verify the zero-knowledge proof. And finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate our scheme.

AB The aim of this article is to analyze the economic aspects of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure defined as physical or virtual systems and assets that are vital to a country's functioning and whose incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national, economic, military and public security. The functioning of modern states, firms and individuals increasingly relies on digital or cyber technologies and this trend has also materialized in various facets of critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure presents a new cybersecurity area of attacks and threats that requires the attention of regulators and service providers. Deploying critical infrastructure systems without suitable cybersecurity might make them vulnerable to intrinsic failures or malicious attacks and result in serious negative consequences. In this article a fuller view of costs and losses associated with cyberattacks that includes both private and external (social) costs is proposed. An application of the cost-benefit analysis or the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) indicator is presented to evaluate the worthiness of cybersecurity efforts and analyze the costs associated with some major cyberattacks in recent years. The "Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover" (IPDRR) framework of organizing cybersecurity efforts is also proposed as well as an illustration as to how the blockchain technology could be utilized to improve security and efficiency within a critical infrastructure.

ID RECORDS
AB Since blockchain was introduced through Bitcoin, research has been ongoing to extend its applications to non-financial use cases. Healthcare is one industry in which blockchain is expected to have significant impacts. Research in this area is relatively new but growing rapidly; so, health informatics researchers and practitioners are always struggling to keep pace with research progress in this area. This paper reports on a systematic review of the ongoing research in the application of blockchain technology in healthcare. The research methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and a systematic mapping study process, in which a well-designed search protocol is used to search four scientific databases, to identify, extract and analyze all relevant publications. The review shows that a number of studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in healthcare; however, there is a lack of adequate prototype implementations and studies to characterize the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. The review further highlights the state-of-the-art in the development of blockchain applications for healthcare, their limitations and the areas for future research. To this end, therefore, there is still the need for more research to better understand, characterize and evaluate the utility of blockchain in healthcare.

AB This paper aims to develop a design for an accounting information system that will enhance the representational faithfulness of financial reporting information. One of the functions of financial reporting is to aggregate and report the entity's private data. This paper shows that recognizing that some of the firm's private data is already shared with others allows the methods of multiparty security to be applied to the reporting and audit processes. We contend that using both public key cryptography and network analysis allows the identity of an entity to be modelled as a place on a network. We also develop accounting recordkeeping techniques to balance public access with privacy using a blockchain. Taken together, these three design ideas can enhance the representational faithfulness of financial reporting systems because they use shared data from independent entities, a transparent system, and open-access immutable storage. Faithful representation is enhanced because information from this system can be used by auditors to support their audit opinion or by stakeholders who need credible information about the entity.

AB As Internet of Things (IoT) involvement increases in our daily lives, several security and privacy concerns like linkability, unauthorized conversations, and side-channel attacks are raised. If they are left untouched, such issues may threaten the existence of IoT. They derive from two main reasons. One is that IoT objects are equipped with limited capabilities in terms of computation power, memory, and bandwidth which hamper the direct implementation of traditional Internet security techniques. The other reason is the absence of widely-accepted IoT security and privacy guidelines and their appropriate implementation techniques. Such guidelines and techniques would greatly assist IoT stakeholders like developers and manufacturers, paving the road for building secure IoT systems from the start and, thus, reinforcing IoT security and privacy by design. In order to contribute to such objective, we first briefly discuss the primary IoT security goals and recognize IoT stakeholders. Second, we propose a comprehensive list of IoT security and privacy guidelines for the edge nodes and communication levels of IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, we point out the IoT stakeholders such as customers and manufacturers who will benefit most from these guidelines. Moreover, we identify a set of implementation techniques by which such guidelines can be accomplished, and possible attacks against previously-mentioned levels can be alleviated. Third, we discuss the challenges of IoT security and privacy guidelines, and we briefly discuss digital rights management in IoT. Finally, through this survey, we suggest several open issues that require further investigation in the future. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first survey that covers the above-mentioned objectives.

AB In this qualitative study, we explore how incumbent firms in traditional industries build dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Digital transformation has been defined as the use of new digital technologies, such as mobile, artificial intelligence, cloud, blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies, to enable major business improvements to augment customer experience, streamline operations, or create new business models. In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.

TI A Hierarchical and Abstraction-Based Blockchain Model

DE blockchain; abstract interpretation; hierarchical model
AB In the nine years since its launch, amid intense research, scalability is always a serious concern in blockchain, especially in case of large-scale network generating huge number of transaction-records. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain model characterized by: (1) each level maintains multiple local blockchain networks, (2) each local blockchain records local transactional activities, and (3) partial views (tunable w.r.t. precision) of different subsets of local blockchain-records are maintained in the blockchains at next level of the hierarchy. To meet this objective, we apply abstractions on a set of transaction-records in a regular time interval by following the Abstract Interpretation framework, which provides a tunable precision in various abstract domain and guarantees the soundness of the system. While this model suitably fits to the real-worlds organizational structures, the proposal is powerful enough to scale when large number of nodes participate in a network resulting into an enormous growth of the network-size and the number of transaction-records. We discuss experimental results on a small-scale network with three sub networks at lower-level and by abstracting the transaction-records in the abstract domain of intervals. The results are encouraging and clearly indicate the effectiveness of this approach to control exponential growth of blockchain size w.r.t. the total number of participants in the network.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is steadily growing and migrating to decentralized architectures. In this context the Swarm approach, based on organic, edge-centric IoT networks, proposes one step further toward cooperation among devices, through the creation of a communication mediator called Swarm Broker. An important aspect in creating a cooperation network in the Swarm is the economical domain: the Swarm economy that guarantees fair rules to stimulate resource sharing among participants. This economic aspect is even more challenging in networks with distributed governance and motivates the adoption of a technology for a trustworthy and immutable public registry, such as blockchain, to store transaction information. In this paper, we aim to create an economic model that regulate the cooperation among the participants of the Swarm, by implementing strategies, to fulfill the restrictions posed by the decentralized network and the presence of resource-constrained devices that integrate the Swarm. We created a microeconomic model for resource sharing in the Swarm and a transaction model, based on the price and reputation of participants. We created a blockchain-based system for storing currency, contract, and reputation information in a distributed way. We included the resulting models and implementation into the Swarm network, by adding a module into the Swarm Broker.

AB Carpooling enables passengers to share a vehicle to reduce traveling time, vehicle carbon emissions, and traffic congestion. However, the majority of passengers lean to find local drivers, but querying a remote cloud server leads to an unnecessary communication overhead and an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide local data processing with low latency, but it also raises new security and privacy concerns because users' private information (e.g., identity and location) could be disclosed when these information are shared during carpooling. While they can be encrypted before transmission, it makes user matching a challenging task and malicious users can upload false locations. Moreover, carpooling records should be kept in a distributed manner to guarantee reliable data auditability. To address these problems, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving carpooling scheme using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing to support conditional privacy, one-to-many matching, destination matching, and data auditability. Specifically, we authenticate users in a conditionally anonymous way. Also, we adopt private proximity test to achieve one-to-many proximity matching and extend it to efficiently establish a secret communication key between a passenger and a driver. We store all location grids into a tree and achieve get-off location matching using a range query technique. A private blockchain is built to store carpooling records. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in terms of computational costs and communication overhead.

AB Public blockchain networks using proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols are considered as a promising platform for decentralized resource management with financial incentive mechanisms. In order to maintain a secured, universal state of the blockchain, PoW-based consensus protocols financially incentivize the nodes in the network to compete for the privilege of block generation through cryptographic puzzle solving. For rational consensus nodes, i.e., miners with limited local computational resources, offloading the computation load for PoW to the cloud/fog providers (CFPs) becomes a viable option. In this paper, we study the interaction between the CFPs and the miners in a PoW-based blockchain network using a game theoretic approach. In particular, we propose a lightweight infrastructure of the PoW-based blockchains, where the computation-intensive part of the consensus process is offloaded to the cloud/fog. We formulate the computation resource management in the blockchain consensus process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the profit of the CFP and the utilities of the individual miners are jointly optimized. In the first stage of the game, the CFP sets the price of offered computing resource. In the second stage, the miners decide on the amount of service to purchase accordingly. We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibria in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For uniform pricing where the same price applies to all miners, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved by capitalizing on the variational inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model.

AB The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of Energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by 'intrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract-based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. First, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Second, a reputation-based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Third, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs for energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Furthermore, a novel energy allocation mechanism is proposed to allocate the limited renewable energy for EVs. Finally, extensive numerical results are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

AB With dramatic developments of blockchain technology, a number of blockchain-based applications emerge rapidly, among which the incorporation of blockchain into Internet of Things is one of the most valued research direction. Such powerful incorporation is a double-sided sword, i.e., it can benefit both individuals and society but has the vulnerability to coin hopping attack that is a new type of pool mining attack and hard to happen in traditional blockchain networks. In this paper, we theoretically prove the feasibility of coin hopping attack, deeply analyze the conditions of attack implementation, and comprehensively investigate the impacts of coin hopping attack. Moreover, some defense strategies are addressed. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work targeting coin hopping attack.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB With the developments of communication technologies and smart manufacturing, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged. Software-defined networking (SDN), a promising paradigm shift, has provided a viable way to manage HoT dynamically, called software-defined IIoT (sDito r). In SDIIoT, lots of data and flows are generated by industrial devices, where a physically distributed but logically centralized control plane is necessary. However, one of the most intractable problems is how to reach consensus among multiple controllers under complex industrial environments. In this paper, we propose a blockchain (BC)-based consensus protocol in SDIIoT, along with detailed consensus steps and theoretical analysis, where BC works as a trusted third party to collect and synchronize network-wide views between different SDN controllers. Specially, it is a permissioned BC. In order to improve the throughput of this BC-based SDIIoT, we jointly consider the trust features of BC nodes and controllers, as well as the computational capability of the BC system. Accordingly, we formulate view change, access selection, and computational resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. We describe this problem as a Markov decision process by defining state space, action space, and reward function. Due to the fact that it is difficult to solve this joint problem by traditional methods, we propose a novel dueling deep Q-learning approach. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

AB The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has brought huge challenges for large data storage, intelligent management, and information security for the entire system. The traditional centralized management approach for IoV faces the difficulty in dealing with real-time response. The blockchain, as an effective technology for decentralized distributed storage and security management, has already showed great advantages in its application of Bitcoin. In this paper, we investigate how the blockchain technology could be extended to the application of vehicle networking, especially with the consideration of the distributed and secure storage of big data. We define several types of nodes such as vehicle and roadside for vehicle networks and form several sub-blockchain networks. In this paper, we present a model of the outward transmission of vehicle blockchain data, and then give detail theoretical analysis and numerical results. This paper has shown the potential to guide the application of blockchain for future vehicle networking.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been dominating their respective research domains for some time. IoT offers automation at the finest level in different fields, while BC provides secure transaction processing for asset exchanges. The capability of IoT devices to generate transactions prompts their integration with BC as the next logical step. The biggest challenges in this integration are the scalability of ledger and rate of transaction execution in BC. On one hand, due to their large numbers, IoT devices will generate transactions at a rate which current block chain solutions cannot handle. On the other hand, implementing BC peers onto IoT devices is impossible due to resource constraints. This prohibits direct integration of both technologies in their current state. In this paper, we propose a solution to address these challenges by using a local peer network to bridge the gap. It restricts the number of transactions which enters the global BC by implementing a scalable local ledger, without compromising on the peer validation of transactions at local and global level. The testbed evaluations show significant reduction in the block weight and ledger size on global peers.

AB The drastically increasing volume and the growing trend on the types of data have brought in the possibility of realizing advanced applications such as enhanced driving safety, and have enriched existing vehicular services through data sharing among vehicles and data analysis. Due to limited resources with vehicles, vehicular edge computing and networks (VECONs) i.e., the integration of mobile edge computing and vehicular networks, can provide powerful computing and massive storage resources. However, road side units that primarily presume the role of vehicular edge computing servers cannot be fully trusted, which may lead to serious security and privacy challenges for such integrated platforms despite their promising potential and benefits. We exploit consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies to achieve secure data storage and sharing in vehicular edge networks. These technologies efficiently prevent data sharing without authorization. In addition, we propose a reputation-based data sharing scheme to ensure high-quality data sharing among vehicles. A three-weight subjective logic model is utilized for precisely managing reputation of the vehicles. Numerical results based on a real dataset show that our schemes achieve reasonable efficiency and high-level of security for data sharing in VECONs.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed rapidly to make our life easier. In many loT applications (e.g., smart homes, healthcare, etc.), all the IoT devices should be synchronized in time. However, some malicious nodes located in the IoT network can influence the time synchronization, which may interrupt the IoT system and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is critical and challenging to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of time during the time synchronization among all the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme to assure the security during time synchronization in IoT. Specifically, a publicly verifiable ledger is utilized to record and broadcast time, which can minimize many attacks from external environments. The use of multiple time sources can avoid the vulnerabilities caused by the centralized generation of accurate time. Moreover, the decentralized structure of this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing an improved practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that our proposed scheme can achieve the desired security with high efficiency.

AB Internet of Things (IoT)-based E-commerce is a new business model that relies on autonomous transaction management on IoT-devices. The management system toward loT-based E-commerce demands autonomy, lightweight, and legitimacy. As blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, we adopt it to design the autonomous transaction management system on IoT E-commerce. However, current blockchain solutions, most namely cryptocurrencies, have fatal drawbacks of nonsupervisability and huge computational overhead, and hence cannot be directly applied on IoT-based E-commerce. In this paper, we propose NormaChain, a blockchain-based normalized autonomous transaction settlement system for IoT-based E-commerce. By designing a special three-layer sharding blockchain network, we can significantly increase transaction efficiency and system scalability. Additionally, by designing an innovative decentralized public key searchable encryption scheme (decentralized public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme), we can uncover illegal and criminal transactions and achieve crime traceability. Our new decentralized PEKS scheme cryptographically eliminates the dependence of a trusted central authority in the original PEKS scheme and instead expands it to a fully decentralized governance, which distributes the supervision power equally among all parties. More importantly, by proving NormaChain is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks and against the stealing of the secret key, we show that NormaChain prevents a legitimate user's privacy from being violated by banks, supervisors or malicious adversaries. Finally, we deliver the NormaChain system with design details and full implementations. Experiments show that the average transaction-per-second on IoT devices is around 113, and the supervision accuracy is 100% when proper target illegal keywords are provided.

AB The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) implies new technical challenges such as managing a universally vast number of IoT devices. Despite the fact that there are already a variety of secure management frameworks for IoT, they are based on centralized models, which limits their applicability in scenarios with a large number of IoT devices. In order to overcome those limitations, we have developed a distributed IoT management system based on blockchain. In this paper, we compare the performance of our solution with the existing access management solutions in IoT. We study the delays and the throughput rate associated with the systems and analyze different configurations of our solution to maximize its scalability. The objective of this paper is to find out whether our solution can scale as well as the existing management systems in IoT.

AB Currently, the number of Internet of Things (ha) devices making up the IoT is more than 11 billion and this number has been continuously increasing. The prevalence of these devices leads to an emerging IoT business model called Device-as-a-service, which enables sensor devices to collect data disseminated to all interested devices. The devices sharing data with other devices could receive some financial reward, such as Bitcoin. However, side-channel attacks, which aim to exploit some information leaked from the IoT devices during data trade execution, are possible since most of the IoT devices are vulnerable to be hacked or compromised. Thus, it is challenging to securely realize data trading in IoT environment due to the information leakage, such as leaking the private key for signing a Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin system. In this paper, we propose LRCoin, a kind of leakage-resilient cryptocurrency based on bitcoin in which the signature algorithm used for authenticating bitcoin transactions is leakage-resilient. LRCoin is suitable for the scenarios where information leakage is inevitable, such as loT applications. Our core contribution is proposing an efficient bilinear-based continual-leakage-resilient ECDSA signature. We prove the proposed signature algorithm is unforgeable against adaptively chosen messages attack in the generic bilinear group model under the continual leakage setting. Both the theoretical analysis and the implementation demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme.

AB With the popularization of intelligent terminals, crowdsensing has become increasingly prominent because of its advantages, such as low cost, high convenience, and fast speed in conducting tasks. However, the quality of the data collected through crowdsensing is varied and is difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in the existence of fraud and other problems. To solve these two questions, a crowdsensing quality control model based on a two-consensus blockchain is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and the two-consensus approach are proposed to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, to help task publishers obtain higher-quality sensing data, the methods of node matching and QGE are proposed. The former method uses the idea of the calculation of matching degree to select workers, and the latter uses the idea of clustering and fuzzy theories to evaluate the quality of the sensing data. Finally, the experiments show that the running time of the block generation in our model is acceptable, and comparing with the other methods, our model can acquire data of higher quality after the addition of malicious nodes.

TI EdgeChain: An Edge-IoT Framework and Prototype Based on Blockchain and

AB The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On one hand, IoT devices are "weak" and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively "vulnerable" facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named "EdgeChain" based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or "coin" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is visioned to connect everything in the world by a common networking technique. In spite that Internet protocol is the most prevailing networking solution, it is difficult to adapt to loT which is born with scalability, heterogeneity, and dynamics. Thanks to the content-centric communication paradigm, it exerts data-naming strategy to incorporate the heterogeneity and dynamics so as to apply for IoT, composing Named Data Networking (NDN) of Things. However, the paradigm also introduces new types of security attacks. In this paper, the NDN of Things architecture will be illustrated and the security analysis is conducted. Furthermore, the potential security attacks of NDN of Things are categorized and the performance impact caused by security attacks is evaluated. Finally, the solutions for NDN of Things security attacks are discussed and a blockchain solution is illustrated.

AB Blockchain has shown a great potential in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems for establishing trust and consensus mechanisms without involvement of any third party. Understanding the relationship between communication and blockchain as well as the performance constraints posing on the counterparts can facilitate designing a dedicated blockchain-enabled IoT systems. In this paper, we establish an analytical model for the blockchain-enabled wireless IoT system. By considering spatio-temporal domain Poisson distribution, i.e., node geographical distribution in spatial domain and transaction arrival rate in time domain are both modeled as Poisson point process (PPP), we first derive the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), blockchain transaction successful rate as well as overall throughput. Based on the system model and performance analysis, we design an algorithm to determine the optimal full function node deployment for blockchain system under the criterion of maximizing transaction throughput. Finally, the security performance is analyzed in the proposed networks with three typical attacks. Solutions such as physical layer security are presented and discussed to keep the system secure under these attacks. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and optimal node deployment algorithm.

AB In this paper, we propose a blockchain inspired Internet-of-Things architecture for creating a transparent food supply chain. The architecture uses a proof-of-object-based authentication protocol, which is analogous to the cryptocurrency's proof-of-work protocol. The complete architecture was realized by integrating a radio frequency identification (RFID)-based sensor at the physical layer and blockchain at the cyber layer. The RFID provides a unique identity of the product and the sensor data, which helps in real time quality monitoring. For this purpose, a small feature size 900-MHz RFID coupled sensor was fabricated and demonstrated for real time sensor data acquisition. The blockchain architecture aids in creating a tamper-proof digital database of the food packages at each instance. A detailed security analysis was performed to investigate the vulnerability of the proposed architecture under different types of cyber attacks.

AB Efficient information flow in an intelligent system is vital for effectively controlling the entire system. Currently, intelligent systems are used in many industries related to energy production, sustainable agriculture/transport, and intelligent building/cities. Information technology (IT) and information and communication technologies (ICT) play vital roles in introducing technical or technological innovation in these industries as well as establishing a collaborative network. Also, the digitization of existing systems has been quite effective at creating a sustainable global environment as it allows more efficient and well-balanced control of socio-economic factors. However, it has become clear that adopting an intelligent system to achieve innovation, sustainability, and safety may well depend on the quality of the algorithms to be used for that very system. Despite recent controversies, new and renewable energies are considered as a realistic alternative to fossil fuels, which have been integral to modern industries but are regarded as a cause of environmental or economic problems, not to mention their limited deposits. Therefore, since renewable energies will gradually replace existing energy sources but require more time to be fully available, it is essential to find a method of managing them in a fair and transparent way. The United States, Japan, and some European countries are attempting to achieve such a goal by utilizing a blockchain system, but the issues pertaining to its functionality, security, or efficiency have yet to be addressed. This study introduces a viable consensus algorithm (Hyper Delegation Proof of Randomness, or HDPoR algorithm) for blockchain and attempts to validate its parallel computing capability through simulations. This study also attempts to design an efficient but secure peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction service model for these energies for the future where blockchain-based systems will hold a key position in the digitalized world. As its main contribution, this study introduces an effective method of applying blockchain to a new and renewable energy transaction system by presenting a consensus algorithm that can improve its infrastructure and performance.

AB The advent and development of digital technologies has had a significant impact on the establishment of contracts. Smart contracts are designed as computer code containing instructions for executing user agreements, offering a technologically secure solution with numerous advantages and applications. However, smart contracts are not without their problems when we try to fit them into the traditional system of contract law, and their presumed benefits can become shortcomings. Bibliometric studies can help to assess the current state of science in a specific subject and support decision making and research direction. Here, this bibliometric study is used to analyze global trend research in relation to this novel contractual methodology, the smart contract, which seems to have experienced exponential growth since 2014. Specially, this analysis was focused on the main countries involved and the institutions that lead this research worldwide. On the other hand, the indexations of these works are analyzed according to major scientific areas and the keywords of all the works, to detect the subjects to which they are grouped. Community detection has been used to establish the relationship between countries researching in this area, and six clusters have been identified, around which all the work related to this topic is grouped. This work shows the temporal evolution of research related to smart contracts, highlighting that there are two trendse-commerce and smart power grids. From the perspective of driving sustainability, smart contracts could provide a contribution in the near future.

AB Making universal access to education compatible with different paths of learning is one of the great challenges of the last century. Technology has provided solutions to access information, for communication and collaborative work. Blockchain emerges as a technology that can be useful for the development of an evaluation model of individualized learning itineraries in mass university subjects. In this line, the Edublocs project has been designed and executed, an initiative where these itineraries have been designed, incorporating elements of peer learning, team-teaching, PLEs, microlearning, technology-enhanced assessment...
   The objective of the Edublocs project is to design and implement a system of recording the results of activities through Blockchain that allow the student to follow a personal itinerary, and the teacher-tutor of the subject to carry out a formative evaluation and an accrediting appraisal of their work. The project is well underway in the evaluation of the implementation process.
   The experience with some elements of the design and the experimental execution in a formal university context during the present academic course, has allowed us to obtain important indications on the viability and relevance of the use of Blockchain in education. These, together with the explanation and justification of explaining the context of its applicability, will be laid out in the broad development of the article.

AB In a closed economic system like blockchain, the total amount of generated cryptocurrency called bitcoin is conserved and the transaction patterns demonstrate an insight of money flow inside the blockchain. For the last 2years, bitcoin market has grabbed an immense attention from the investors, technology entrepreneurs and currency enthusiasts. In this paper, we have come up with some findings in our investigation about the bitcoin time-series transaction patterns. We have graphically represented bitcoin's weekly patterns as a real economic currency that has been minted, stored and exchanged inside the bitcoin blockchain network. We identified outliers' activities with the help of descriptive statistical analysis. We also demonstrated transaction pattern behavioral change. The main implication of these findings is to understand some stylized facts of the time-series transaction of cryptocurrency-based fully digital financial system. Besides in our analysis, we have shown that the behavioral change of the transaction pattern is capable of explaining the system development events or major historical events that have a network impact.

TI A Blockchain-Based Data Life Cycle Protection Framework for
   Information-Centric Networks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHEME
AB Information-centric networking (ICN) supports efficient data provision and retrieval with in-network caching. The data life cycle over ICN includes atomic data collection, data publication, caching, and retrieval, suffering from various attacks, such as regulation violation and false claim. Existing solutions have not considered regulation compliance and typically focus on the protection of a specific procedure. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based data life cycle protection framework (BDLP), which exploits the transaction and smart contract to provide a trusted and neutral environment in ICN. In BDLP, a special type of node, a data dam blockchain node, is designed to locally control registration and restrict data flow, besides the function of a blockchain node. BDLP consists of five types of transactions (RegT, CollectT, PubT, PayT, and PunT) to achieve accountability and four types of smart contracts (PubSC, PaySC, AccSC, and RepSC) to achieve authentication, regulation compliance, and neutrality. We elaborate on the data retrieval procedure in BDLP and analyze its scalability, demonstrating that BDLP can achieve a low data retrieval permission delay.

TI Securing ICN-Based UAV Ad Hoc Networks with Blockchain
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Named data networking (NON) enables fast and efficient content dissemination in mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle ad hoc networks (UAANETs); however, its in-network caching mechanism brings a new security challenge: content poisoning. Poisoned content can contaminate the cache on the routers and isolate valid content from the network, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. To mitigate such attacks and enhance network-layer trust of NON-based UAANETs, this article proposes a novel and systematic framework that integrates interest-key-content binding (IKCB), forwarding strategy, and on-demand verification to efficiently discover poisoned content. To further provide decentralized IKCB store and detect internal attackers, we introduce a lightweight permissioned blockchain system over NDN and develop a scalable adaptive delegate consensus algorithm. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed framework can effectively purge poisoned content with low overhead, and our algorithms achieve great performance to fit UAANETs.

AB We present an example, where a distributed coordinated protocol supported by a simple monetary mechanism leads to achieving optimal information theoretic degrees of freedom gains. The considered setting is that of a linear interference network, where cooperative transmission is allowed, but at no cost in terms of the overall backhaul load. We show that a simple monetary mechanism that consists only of one coin type can enable the achievability of the optimal centralized solution. The proposed greedy distributed algorithm relies on incentivizing the users to share their resources in one channel use, in return of credit they receive for maximizing their rate gains in future channel uses. This example is the first in its class and it opens the door for constructing a unified framework for monetary mechanisms for optimal interference management and spectrum sharing. This problem carries the promise of a significant impact as blockchain techniques open the door for implementing such mechanisms in practice.

AB As blockchain platforms are becoming increasingly noticeable in financial services and beyond, questions arise regarding their suitability to compete with or replace existing payment systems and marketplaces and redesign the financial infrastructures of the future. Prominent among these concerns are issues around governance and control in distributed ledgers: How are distributed ledger technologies governed? Can blockchains address complex administration problems? What key issues of note for practitioners and academics have emerged thus far? In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.

AB Those working on Blockchain technologies have described several new innovative directions and novel services in the Internet of things (IoT), including decentralized trust, trusted and verifiable execution of smart contracts, and machine-to-machine communications and automation that reach beyond the mere exchange of data. However, applying blockchain principles in the IoT is a challenge due to the constraints of the end devices. Because of fierce cost pressure, the hardware resources in these devices are usually reduced to the minimum necessary for operation. To achieve the high coverage needed, low bitrate mobile or wireless technologies are frequently applied, so the communication is often constrained, too. These constraints make the implementation of blockchain nodes for IoT as standalone end-devices impractical or even impossible. We therefore investigated possible design approaches to decentralized applications based on the Ethereum blockchain for the IoT. We proposed and evaluated three application architectures differing in communication, computation, storage, and security requirements. In a pilot setup we measured and analyzed the data traffic needed to run the blockchain clients and their applications. We found out that with the appropriate designs and the remote server architecture we can strongly reduce the storage and communication requirements imposed on devices, with predictable security implications. Periodic device traffic is reduced to 2400 B/s (HTTP) and 170 B/s (Websocket) from about 18 kB/s in the standalone-device full client architecture. A notification about a captured blockchain event and the corresponding verification resulted in about 2000 B of data. A transaction sent from the application to the client resulted in an about 500 B (HTTP) and 300 B message (Websocket). The key store location, which affects the serialization of a transaction, only had a small influence on the transaction-related data. Raw transaction messages were 45 B larger than when passing the JSON transaction objects. These findings provide directions for fog/cloud IoT application designers to avoid unrealistic expectations imposed upon their IoT devices and blockchain technologies, and enable them to select the appropriate system design according to the intended use case and system constraints. However, for very low bit-rate communication networks, new communication protocols for device to blockchain-client need to be considered.

AB Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.

AB Electronic systems are ubiquitous today, playing an irreplaceable role in our personal lives, as well as in critical infrastructures such as power grids, satellite communications, and public transportation. In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable "by default" without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.

   industrial revolution; national security
AB Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies are widely discussed nowadays. The Bitcoin market value is discussed in top magazines, the names of people who earned money from cryptocurrencies are on the Richest People list. The Blockchain technology is said to be a one of disruption pioneers on the one hand, and cryptocurrency is said to be an illegal phenomenon on the other hand. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is based on digitalized industry is changing the power centres. Will cryptocurrency disrupt the financial sector? Or perhaps it will disrupt the retail market or global monetary policy. Disruptive technologies together with the Internet, Mobile Internet and Internet of Things are changing our world. While society has gained simple and reachable comfort for a cheaper price on the one hand, many people have lost their jobs on the other. Consequently, the authors presuppose discussion about the phenomenon of cryptocurrency through the context of social phenomena and legal regulation: divulge definitions, principles, relating to the topic; identify possible tendencies according to legal regulation and its practical realization.

TI Digital identity: Contemporary challenges for data protection, privacy

SO BIG DATA & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Biometric data; blockchain; data protection; digital identity;
   non-discrimination; privacy
AB The World Bank estimates that over one billion people currently lack official identity documents. To tackle this crucial issue, the United Nations included the aim to provide legal identity for all by 2030 among the Sustainable Development Goals. Technology can be a powerful tool to reach this target. In the digital age, new technologies increasingly mediate identity verification and identification of individuals. Currently, State-led and public-private initiatives use technology to provide official identification, to control and secure external borders, and to distribute humanitarian aid to populations in need. All of these initiatives have profound implications for the protection of human rights of those affected by them. Digital identity technologies may render individuals without legal documentation more visible and therefore less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. However, they also present risks for the protection of individuals' human rights. As they build on personal data for identification and identity verification, data protection and privacy rights are most clearly affected. The prohibition of discrimination in the digital space is also of concern as these technological advances' societal impact is not yet fully understood. Accordingly, the article argues that emerging digital identity platforms will only contribute to the protection of human rights if the providers adequately mitigate any risks of potential discrimination and promote high standards of privacy and data protection.

ID RISE
AB Whilst blockchain technology has attracted substantial attention within the scholarly literature of a number of disciplines, including economics, finance, law and technology, it has been subject to minimal discussion and scrutiny within the scholarly accounting literature. This article argues that this is a missed opportunity and that the maturation of blockchain technology may represent as profound a shift in accounting as the emergence and adoption of double-entry accounting.

TI Blockchain as the Database Engine in the Accounting System
SO AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the prediction that blockchain technology will transform accounting and the profession because transactions recorded on a blockchain can be aggregated into financial statements and confirmed as true and accurate. We argue that blockchain technology affects the database engine of the accounting information system (AIS) through digitisation of the current paper-based validation process. In a blockchain-based AIS, accountants will no longer be the central authority but will remain the preparer of financial reports required by regulations; they will continue to influence policies such as the choice and accreditation of validators and serve as validators of last resort. Audit evidence still needs to be gathered for rendering of an audit opinion in a blockchain-based AIS. While digitisation of the validation process reduces the error rate and lowers the cost of vouching and tracing, and immutability of blockchain data reduces the incentive and opportunities for fraud, a blockchain-based AIS alone does not guarantee that financial reports are true and fair. Lower error rates and reduced incentives for accounting fraud in a blockchain-based AIS are expected to improve audit quality. This prediction will need to be empirically tested when blockchain-based AIS become available. Using the three-tier architecture of the AIS, this paper addresses the gap in the literature that misses how characteristics of blockchain technology can influence the implementation of a blockchain-based AIS with related implications for the accounting profession.

SO AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; BITCOIN
AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology expected to have significant impacts on the accounting and auditing profession. This study, applicable and timely for both accounting and auditing scholars and practitioners, explores blockchain technology and its main implications for the accounting and auditing profession. The research question addressed in this study is: What are the major themes emerging from academic research and professional reports and websites debating blockchain technology in the accounting and auditing context? A literature review of academic literature and professional reports and websites is performed to identify a taxonomy of emerging themes. The study finds that the most discussed themes in scholarly works and professional sources are governance, transparency and trust issues in the blockchain ecosystem, blockchain-enabled continuous audits, smart contract applications and the paradigmatic shift in accountants' and auditors' roles. Based on these four themes, practical implications for accountants and auditors on how to approach the blockchain development are provided. Moreover, this study offers suggestions for future research on accounting and auditing in the blockchain era.

AB With the rapid development of smart mobile terminals (MTs), various industrial Internet of things (IIoT) applications can fully leverage them to collect and share data for providing certain services. However, two key challenges still remain. One is how to achieve high-quality data collection with limited MT energy resource and sensing range. Another is how to ensure security when sharing and exchanging data among MTs, to prevent possible device failure, network communication failure, malicious users or attackers, etc. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled efficient data collection and secure sharing scheme combining Ethereum blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a reliable and safe environment. In this scheme, DRL is used to achieve the maximum amount of collected data, and the blockchain technology is used to ensure security and reliability of data sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide higher security level and stronger resistance to attack than a traditional database based data sharing scheme for different levels/types of attacks.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer-retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

AB Crowd intelligence tries to gather, process, infer, and ascertain massive useful information by utilizing the intelligence of crowds or distributed computers, which has great potential in Industrial Internet of Things. A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders, namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors, or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on many edge servers (ES) of the mobile edge computing network, which together function as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As ES are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be effectively improved. Further, we proved the existence of the only one strong Nash equilibrium, which can maximize the interests of involved ES and make the ecosystem bigger. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the proposed method, respectively.

ID ANONYMIZATION
AB Implementing blockchain techniques has enabled secure smart trading in many realms, e.g. neighboring energy trading. However, trading information recorded on the blockchain also brings privacy concerns. Attackers can utilize data mining algorithms to obtain users' privacy, specially, when the user group is located in nearby geographic positions. In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain-oriented approach to solve the problem of privacy leakage without restricting trading functions. The proposed approach mainly addresses energy trading users' privacy in smart grid and screens the distribution of energy sale of sellers deriving from the fact that various energy trading volumes can be mined to detect its relationships with other information, such as physical location and energy usage. Experiment evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Recent advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide plenty of opportunities for various industries. To address the security and efficiency issues of the massive IIoT data, blockchain is widely considered as a promising solution to enable data storing/processing/sharing in a secure and efficient way. To meet the high throughput requirement, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems, the goals of which are threefold: 1) providing a methodology for evaluating the system from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency, and security; 2) improving the scalability of the underlying blockchain without affecting the system's decentralization, latency, and security; and 3) designing a modulable blockchain for IIoT systems, where the block producers, consensus algorithm, block size, and block interval can be selected/adjusted using the DRL technique. Simulations results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IIoT systems and well adapt to the dynamics of the IIoT.

AB While the intersection of blockchain and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has received considerable research interest lately, the conflict between the high resource requirements of blockchain and the generally inadequate performance of IIoT devices has not been well tackled. On one hand, due to the introductions of mathematical concepts, including Public Key Infrastructure, Merkle Hash Tree, and Proof of Work (PoW), deploying blockchain demands huge computing power. On the other hand, full nodes should synchronize massive block data and deal with numerous transactions in peer-to-peer network, whose occupation of storage capacity and bandwidth makes IIoT devices difficult to afford. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain system called LightChain, which is resource-efficient and suitable for power-constrained IIoT scenarios. Specifically, we present a green consensus mechanism named Synergistic Multiple Proof for stimulating the cooperation of IIoT devices, and a lightweight data structure called LightBlock to streamline broadcast content. Furthermore, we design a novel Unrelated Block Offloading Filter to avoid the unlimited growth of ledger without affecting blockchain's traceability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that LightChain can reduce the individual computational cost to 39.32% and speed up the block generation by up to 74.06%. In terms of storage and network usage, the reductions are 43.35% and 90.55%, respectively.

AB The previous blockchain data transmission techniques in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) have low security, high management cost of the trading center, and big difficulty in supervision. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharingmechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability. The proposed technique can improve the transmission rate and packet receiving rate by 12% and 13%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique has good superiority in sharing management and decentralization.

AB Blockchain has created a revolution in digital networking by using distributed storage, cryptographic algorithms, and smart contracts. Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service.

AB Past few years have witnessed the compelling applications of the blockchain technique in our daily life ranging from the financial market to health care. Considering the integration of the blockchain technique and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain may act as a distributed ledger for beneficially establishing a decentralized autonomous trading platform for industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. However, the power and computation constraints prevent IoT devices from directly participating in this proof-of-work process. As a remedy, in this treatise, the cloud computing service is introduced into the blockchain platform for the sake of assisting to offload computational task from the IIoT network itself. In addition, we study the resource management and pricing problem between the cloud provider and miners. More explicitly, we model the interaction between the cloud provider and miners as a Stackelberg game, where the leader, i.e., cloud provider, makes the price first, and then miners act as the followers. Moreover, in order to find the Nash equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game, a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm is conceived for searching the near-optimal policy. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes.

AB The peer-to-peer energy trading has been achieved among nodes in industrial Internet of Things. To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead.

AB Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.

AB Emerging network computing technologies extend the functionalities of industrial IoT (IIoT) terminals. However, this promising service-provisioning scheme encounters problems in untrusted and distributed IIoT scenarios because malicious service providers or clients may deny service provisions or usage for their own interests. Traditional nonrepudiation solutions fade in IIoT environments due to requirements of trusted third parties or unacceptable overheads. Fortunately, the blockchain revolution facilitates innovative solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fair nonrepudiation service provisioning scheme for IIoT scenarios in which the blockchain is used as a service publisher and an evidence recorder. Each service is separately delivered via on-chain and off-chain channels with mandatory evidence submissions for nonrepudiation purpose. Moreover, a homomorphic-hash-based service verification method is designed that can function with mere on-chain evidence. And an impartial smart contract is implemented to resolve disputes. The security analysis demonstrates the dependability, and the evaluations reveal the effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Customer service is transforming from traditional manual service toward automated service, which utilizes different computational informatics to achieve a higher efficient and quality services. Automated customer service requires big data and expertise in data analysis as prerequisites. However, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises, do not have sufficient data and experience due to their limited scale and resources. They need to rely on third parties, and this reliance results in the lack of development of core customer service competency. In order to overcome these challenges, an open and automated customer service platform based on Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and automated machine learning (AutoML) is proposed. The data are gathered with the use of IoT devices during the customer service. An open but secured environment to achieve data trading is ensured by using blockchain. AutoML is adopted to automate the data analysis processes for reducing the reliance of costly experts. The proposed platform is analyzed through use case evaluation. A prototype system has also been developed and evaluated. The simulation results show that our platform is scalable and efficient.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a smart factory has entered the booming period. However, as the number of nodes and network size become larger, the traditional IIoT architecture can no longer provide effective support for such enormous system. Therefore, we introduce the Blockchain architecture, which is an emerging scheme for constructing the distributed networks, to reshape the traditional IIoT architecture. First, the major problems of the traditional IIoT architecture are analyzed, and the existing improvements are summarized. Second, we introduce a security and privacy model to help design the Blockchain-based architecture. On this basis, we decompose and reorganize the original IIoT architecture to form a new multicenter partially decentralized architecture. Then, we introduce some relative security technologies to improve and optimize the new architecture. After that we design the data interaction process and the algorithms of the architecture. Finally, we use an automatic production platform to discuss the specific implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides better security and privacy protection than the traditional architecture. Thus, the proposed architecture represents a significant improvement of the original architecture, which provides a new direction for the IIoT development.

TI Computing Resource Trading for Edge-Cloud-Assisted Internet of Things

DE Computing resource trading; double auction; edge-cloud computing;
   Internet of things (IoT)
ID BLOCKCHAIN; MANAGEMENT; IOT
AB Optimal computing resource allocation for edge-cloud-assisted Internet of things (IoT) in blockchain network is attracting increasing attention. Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance.

AB Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51% attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an indispensable role for Industry 4.0, where people are committed to implement a general, scalable, and secure IIoT system to be adopted across various industries. However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph-structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance. We implement the system on Raspberry Pi, and conduct a case study for the smart factory. Extensive evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that credit-based PoW mechanism and data access control are secure and efficient in IIoT.

ID RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY; UNCLONABLE FUNCTION; ATTACKS
AB In an environment where cyber attacks are increasing, both in frequency and complexity, novel ways to shield data, users, and procedures have to be envisioned. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are the physical equivalent of one-way mathematical transformations with the exception that their inherent physical complexity renders them resilient to cloning. One interesting deployment scenario includes PUFs as random key generators. The deterministic nature of their operation alleviates the necessity to store the keys in non-volatile means. Along the same lines, blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data once stored while their overall security depends on the quality and secrecy of users' keys. Here, the authors propose a novel optical PUF implementation that can be combined with private blockchain modalities in order to cyber-harden Internet of things ecosystems. PUF-related experimental results are presented, alongside implementation scenarios.

TI TOWARDS THE APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVING TRADE

DT Article
DE Trade facilitation; CEFTA-2002; Blockchain technology; positive aspects;
   deepening digital integration
AB The benefits and value drivers of customs digitalization are considerable. The key motivation is the efficiency associated with minimizing the cost of managing documents throughout the trade process, including costs associated with the exchange of documents with other countries, as well as the procurement and facilitation of those documents. Since it is of general knowledge that effective trade facilitation signifies reliability and security of the trade transactions we think that blockchain technology may be able to offer a high level of confidence in these areas to both traders and regulators. The proposal presented in this paper is focused on jointly moving all (customs) stakeholders towards a standardized integration of collaborative processes. By investigating blockchain solutions along with technology and standards, we propose a pathway to achieving an international system-to-system integration. Taking into consideration the realization of deeper integration among the countries, especially in the field of trade and digital integration, we try to analyze how blockchain technology can help support that integration. In order to analyze the possible application of this technology for deepening CEFTA integration through enhancing trade facilitation we briefly refer to its' positive aspects. Instead of developing individual software solutions in CEFTA countries it might be beneficial to move services to a blockchain technology platform. While currently, this might be hindered by local policies, blockchain technology will have its' influence and application in trade facilitation as it has in many other fields. With full awareness of the possible threats and challenges, it is of the utmost importance to engage in discovering the most compatible pathway to apply this technology in regional trade facilitation and deepen digital integration among CEFTA member countries.

DT Article
DE blockchain; cryptocurrencies; time-series; financial markets
AB This paper aims to gain and improve understanding of the three most common cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple) by applying standard econometric tools upon their time-series data. Cryptocurrencies' returns are compared to six major stock indices: two American (S&P500 and Russell 2000), one European (Stoxx 600), one Japanese (Nikkei 225), one Chinese (Hong Kong Hang Seng) and a global index (S&P Global 1200). The findings indicate that observed cryptocurrencies could be regarded as a new asset class, a fully digital, sui-generis financial instruments, as they are not coherently connected to the stock market. However, allocating capital into cryptocurrencies remains in the domain of pure speculation due to their strong volatility.

DE Document Sharing; Version Control; Integrative Collaboration;
   Blockchain; Ethereum Smart Contracts; IPFS
AB In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution and framework for document sharing and version control to facilitate multi-user collaboration and track changes in a trusted, secure, and decentralized manner, with no involvement of a centralized trusted entity or third party. This solution is based on utilizing Ethereum smart contracts to govern and regulate the document version control functions among the creators and developers of the document and its validators. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store documents on a decentralized file system. The proposed solution automates necessary interactions among multiple actors comprising developers and approvers. Smart contracts have been developed using Solidity language, and their functionalities were tested using the Remix IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The paper demonstrates that our smart contract code is free of commonly known security vulnerabilities and attacks. The code has been made publically available at Github. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COGNITIVE-RADIO
AB Spectrum sharing mechanisms have evolved to meet different needs related to increasing spectrum use efficiency. At first, decentralized and opportunistic cognitive radios (and cognitive radio networks) were the primary focus of research for these mechanisms. This gradually transitioned toward the development of cooperative sharing methods based on databases, typified by TV white spaces databases. Spectrum sharing is now the basis for the dynamic and fine-grained spectrum rights regime for the citizen's band radio service (CBRS) as well as for license shared access (LSA). The emergence of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has stimulated interest in applying its underlying technology, blockchain, to other applications as well, such as securities trading and supply chain management. This paper explores the application of blockchain to radio spectrum management. While blockchains could underlie radio spectrum management more broadly, we will focus on dynamic spectrum sharing applications. Like the cooperative approaches currently in use, blockchain is a database technology. However, a blockchain is a decentralized database in which the owner of the data maintains control. We consider the benefits and limitations of blockchain solutions in general, and then examine their potential application to four major categories of spectrum sharing.

AB Blockchain technology has been considered a vehicle to foster development in poor countries by promoting applications such as secure delivery of humanitarian aid, digital identity services, and proof of provenance. This article examines whether (and if so, how) blockchain technology can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of foreign aid governance, thereby moving beyond completely anonymous contexts. Foreign aid governance is plagued by lack of credible commitments among states, which are further exacerbated by information asymmetries and which often undermine aid effectiveness. In this context, blockchain technology holds two promises. First, through the guaranteed execution of smart contracts, it can strengthen the credibility of state commitments, for example collective burden-sharing rules among a group of donors or recipient country compliance with policy conditionality in return for aid. Second, through leveraging prediction markets, blockchain technology can allay information problems related to the verification of real-world events along the entire aid delivery chain.

TI BLOCKCHAIN IN MANUFACTURING REVOLUTION BASED ON MACHINE TO MACHINE

   FUTURE
AB In the last few years, two technological events emerged. First, the rising of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies such as IoT allowed the direct link between machines on the shop floor, establishing a machine-to-machine communication (M2M). Second, block-chain enables transactions such payments and contracts without a formal reliable or accreditation institutions, such as banks or government.
   Goal: The goal of this paper is to explore the state-of-art of the blockchain technology applied to the manufacture sector. In this sense, the option of the M2M transaction being intermediated by blockchain on the shop floor is a hypothesis to be tested. Moreover, it could be questioned if these subjects are being appreciated by the academia.
   Design / Methodology / Approach: a systematic review of the literature was conducted, considering blockchain, the industrial context, and the Industry 4.0 related technologies.
   Results: As a result, only 12 papers that were classified according to their application fields and practice stages were obtained.
   Limitations of the investigation: this field of application is brand new; thus, the available literature is scarce; only 12 papers were obtained.
   Practical implications: As the main result, it was identified that the possibilities of block-chain applications to Industry have been poorly explored by literature.
   Originality / Value: The paper addresses the possibility of application of blockchain in M2M-based manufacture, and detaches the research gap in the academic literature related to it.

AB In this work we present a primary account of frameup, an incriminatory attack made possible because of existing implementations in distributed peer to peer storage. The frameup attack shows that an adversary has the ability to store unencrypted data on the hard drives of people renting out their hard drive space. This is important to forensic examiners as it opens the door for possibly framing an innocent victim. Our work employs Storj as an example technology, due to its popularity and market size. Storj is a blockchain enabled system that allows people to rent out their hard drive space to other users around the world by employing a cryptocurrency token that is used to pay for the services rendered. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions - but this work is not centered around blockchain. Our work discusses two frameup attacks, a preliminary and an optimized attack, both of which take advantage of Storj's implementation. Results illustrate that Storj allows a potential adversary to store incriminating unencrypted files, or parts of files that are viewable on people's systems when renting out their unused hard drive space. We offer potential solutions to mitigate our discovered attacks, a developed tool to review if a person has been a victim of a frameup attack, and a mechanism for showing that the files were stored on a hard drive without the renter's knowledge. Our hope is that this work will inspire future security and forensics research directions in the exploration of distributed peer to peer storage systems that embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency tokens.

AB Cities are increasingly turning towards specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities.

TI CrowdBC: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Framework for Crowdsourcing

ID PRIVACY
AB Crowdsourcing systems which utilize the human intelligence to solve complex tasks have gained considerable interest and adoption in recent years. However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service ( DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users' privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system.

ID SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB To ensure public safety and security, it is vitally important for governments to collect information from businesses and analyse it. Such information can be used to determine whether transported goods might be suspicious and therefore require physical inspection. Although businesses are obliged to report some information, they are reluctant to share additional information for fear of sharing competitively sensitive information, becoming liable and not being compliant with the law. These reasons are often overlooked in the design of software architectures for information sharing. In the present research, we followed a design science approach to develop a software architecture for business-to-government information sharing. Based on literature and a case study, we elicited the requirements an architecture that provides for the sharing of information should meet to make it acceptable to businesses. We then developed the architecture and evaluated it against the requirements. The architecture consists of a blockchain that stores events and rules for information sharing that are controlled by businesses. For each event, two parties use their private keys to encrypt its Merkle root to confirm that they know the data are correct. This makes it easy to check whether information is reliable and whether an event should be accepted. Access control, metadata and context information enable the context-based sharing of information. This is combined with the encryption and decryption of data to provide access to certain data within an organisation.

AB Door locks and user authentication are the major issues in the current banking industry. There are a number of user future computing techniques, and security is especially essential to these methods. Existing digital door locks have the problem of opening easily with a stolen PIN number or by electrical shock. Thus, this study proposed and implemented an integrated automatic log-in platform based on mobile fingerprint recognition by applying the blockchain theory. As a result of this research, a convenient, integrated automatic log-in platform with powerful security has been constructed using a smartphone-based fingerprint recognition function. There are three major functions of the platform. First, it is possible to authenticate the user in PC, mobile device, and IoT environments through fingerprint recognition. Second, the platform includes SDK to develop application software for user authentication and IoT services. Last is its strengthened security using the blockchain theory to prepare against tampering/forging/leaking of a user's fingerprint information by hackers.

AB Data leakage in electronic health records (EHRs) could result in the compromise of patient privacy (e.g. medical conditions). Generally most data in EHRs remain unchanged once they are uploaded to the system; thus, blockchain can be potentially used to facilitate the sharing of such data. Different participating medical organizations and individuals (e.g. medical practitioners, hospitals, medical labs and insurance companies) can then access EHRs stored on the blockchain with a higher level of confidence. In this paper, a blockchain based searchable encryption scheme for EHRs is proposed. The index for EHRs is constructed through complex logic expressions and stored in the blockchain, so that a data user can utilize the expressions to search the index. As only the index is migrated to the blockchain to facilitate propagation, the data owners have full control over who can see their EHRs data. The use of blockchain technology ensures the integrity, anti-tampering, and traceability of EHR's index. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated from two aspects, namely in terms of the overhead for extracting the document IDs from EHRs and the overhead associated with conducting transactions on smart contract in Ethereum.

AB Data in cloud has always been a point of attraction for the cyber attackers. Nowadays healthcare data in cloud has become their new interest. Attacks on these healthcare data can result in annihilating consequences for the healthcare organizations. Decentralization of these cloud data can minimize the effect of attacks. Storing and running computation on sensitive private healthcare data in cloud are possible by decentralization which is enabled by peer to peer (P2P) network. By leveraging the decentralized or distributed property, blockchain technology ensures the accountability and integrity. Different solutions have been proposed to control the effect of attacks using decentralized approach but these solutions somehow failed to ensure overall privacy of patient centric systems. In this paper, we present a patient centric healthcare data management system using blockchain technology as storage which helps to attain privacy. Cryptographic functions are used to encrypt patient's data and to ensure pseudonymity. We analyze the data processing procedures and also the cost effectiveness of the smart contracts used in our system. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Blockchain; Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS); Trust; Decentralization
ID PRACTICAL REPUTATION SYSTEM; SAFETY
AB Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) is an effective and novel method of data collection and processing. Current MCS generally adopts a centralized architecture by depending on an assumed trusted party. This design easily suffers from single-point failure and cannot be realized in practice since a trusted service provider does not really exist. More dangerously, the centralized party may perform dishonestly and thus harms the benefit and privacy of MCS users. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based MCS system, named MCS-Chain, to realize fully distributed and decentralized trust management in MCS. Aiming at improving the poor efficiency of traditional blockchain technology, we propose a novel consensus mechanism for block generation, which greatly reduces computational overhead. The proposed MCS-Chain system also solves the fork issue and centralization problem suffered by most existing blockchain-based systems. Serious security analysis and experimental evaluation further illustrate the security and efficiency of our system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The blockchain based solutions started to be acknowledged as key differentiator during a wide area of activities. Lately, the subject started to become a vital topic of discussion in the case of the accounting processes as it has the potential of eliminating the redundant activities and offers at the same time a better level of the data security. This study is investigating the context in which the accounting practitioners can benefit from the use of this technology, by analyzing the actual need of the companies for this, along with the implications of the data privacy introduced in 2018 by the European Union. The paper is focusing on providing a practical point of view on the main challenges and advantages, shifting the research from a conceptual point of view to the everyday impact.

AB Blockchain has a range of built-in features, such as distributed ledger, decentralized storage, authentication, security, and immutability, and has moved beyond hype to practical applications in industry sectors such as Healthcare. Blockchain applications in the healthcare sector generally require more stringent authentication, interoperability, and record sharing requirements, due to exacting legal requirements, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Building on existing blockchain technologies, researchers in both academia and industry have started to explore applications that are geared toward healthcare use. These applications include smart contracts, fraud detection, and identity verification. Even with these improvements, there are still concerns as blockchain technology has its own specific vulnerabilities and issues that need to be addressed, such as mining incentives, mining attacks, and key management. Additionally, many of the healthcare applications have unique requirements that are not addressed by many of the blockchain experiments being explored, as highlighted in this survey paper. A number of potential research opportunities are also discussed in this paper.

AB The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges.
   The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (FBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time.
   The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.

It is suggested that blockchain technology is a timely innovation with potential to facilitate this future. Peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids can support renewable energy as well as economically empower consumers and prosumers. However, the rapid development of blockchain and prospects for P2P energy networks is coupled with several grey areas in the institutional landscape. The purpose of this paper is to holistically explore potential challenges of blockchain-based P2P microgrids, and propose practical implications for institutional development as well as academia. An analytical framework for P2P microgrids is developed based on literature review as well as expert interviews. The framework incorporates 1) Technological, 2) Economic, 3) Social, 4) Environmental and 5) Institutional dimensions. Directions for future work in practical and academic contexts are identified. It is suggested that bridging the gap from technological to institutional readiness would require the incorporation of all dimensions as well as their inter-relatedness. Gradual institutional change leveraging community-building and regulatory sandbox approaches are proposed as potential pathways in incorporating this multi-dimensionality, reducing cross-sectoral silos, and facilitating interoperability between current and future systems. By offering insight through holistic conceptualization, this paper aims to contribute to expanding research in building the pillars of a more substantiated institutional arch for blockchain in the energy sector.

TI Cloud-assisted secure eHealth systems for tamper-proofing EHR via

AB The wide deployment of cloud-assisted electronic health (eHealth) systems has already shown great benefits in managing electronic health records (EHRs) for both medical institutions and patients. However, it also causes critical security concerns. Since once a medical institution generates and outsources the patients' EHRs to cloud servers, patients would not physically own their EHRs but the medical institution can access the EHRs as needed for diagnosing, it makes the EHRs integrity protection a formidable task, especially in the case that a medical malpractice occurs, where the medical institution may collude with the cloud server to tamper with the outsourced EHRs to hide the medical malpractice. Traditional cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data integrity protection cannot be directly adopted because they cannot ensure the security in the case of collusion between the cloud server and medical institution.
   In this paper, a secure cloud-assisted eHealth system is proposed to protect outsourced EHRs from illegal modification by using the blockchain technology (blockchain-based currencies, e.g., Ethereum). The key idea is that the EHRs only can be outsourced by authenticated participants and each operation on outsourcing EHRs is integrated into the public blockchain as a transaction. Since the blockchain-based currencies provide a tamper-proofing way to conduct transactions without a central authority, the EHRs cannot be modified after the corresponding transaction is recorded into the blockchain. Therefore, given outsourced EHRs, any participant can check their integrity by checking the corresponding transaction. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed system can provide a strong security guarantee with a high efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The digitalization phenomenon is leveraging new relationship models through the entire supply chain network. In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) becomes vital source of converting things into smart, including smart homes, smart cities, smart industries etc. Internet of things have the ability to connect billions of things at the same time, which seeks to develop information sharing requirements that improve our daily lives. By seeing things on the Internet, traditional devices become intelligent and independent, and this vision becomes real and realistic. The Blockchain appears a great source of providing security to new era technological applications. The high growth of IoT based smart applications have high demand of security to manage and maintain the IoT based application's data safety, security integrity, and authentication. The merger of both technologies may provide our secure security solutions. This research explores the Internet of things security solutions by integrating IoT applications with blockchain. The research initially focused on the blockchain basics, types, design for Internet of things applications. Further we elaborate the several challenges and issue of BIoT applications linked to the energy efficiency, security, privacy, throughput, latency, block size, bandwidth, usability, multi chain management, versioning, forks, autonomy and enforcement. Finally, we explore the future directions of blockchain for the internet of things. The literature-based results showed, that the integration of Blockchain with Internet of things provides significant solutions of security and privacy to IoT based application.

AB Electronic voting (e-voting) is an electronic means for casting and counting votes. It is an efficient and cost-effective way for conducting a voting procedure, which has characteristic of being magnanimous data and real time and requesting high safety. However, concerns on security of networking and privacy of communication for e-voting have been grown. Securing e-voting is very urgent and has becoming a popular topic in the area of communications and networking. We present techniques to exploit blockchain in P2P network to improve the security of e-voting. First, we design a synchronized model of voting records based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) to avoid forgery of votes. Second, we design a user credential model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide authentication and non-repudiation. Third, we design a withdrawal model that allows voters to change their vote before a preset deadline. By integrating the above designs, a blockchain-based e-voting scheme in P2P network is proposed for essential requirements of e-voting process. To prove and verify the scheme, a blockchain-based e-voting system for multiple candidates has been designed on Linux platforms in P2P network. The system involves electronic voting theory, cryptography, and software engineering theory. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure e-voting system, which solves the problem on forgery of votes during e-voting. The blockchain-based e-voting system can be applied to a variety of networking applications directly.

ID RANDOM BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; MORPHOLOGY CONTROL
AB Microsized giant vesicles supporting a hindered amine on their shells were obtained by the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers using the photo nitroxide mediated living radical polymerization (photo NMP) technique. The diblock copolymer consisting of hydrophilic poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl methacrylate) (PTPMA) and hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate-random-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl methacrylate), P(MMA-r-TPMA) produced various morphologies depending on the stirring speed during the photo NMP-induced self-assembly, block lengths of the copolymer, and hydrophobicity of the P(MMA-r-TPMA) block chain. A 300-rpm stirring speed during the polymerization provided worm-like vesicles with a long axis of over 100 mu m along with small spherical vesicles with a 3-mu m diameter. As the stirring speed increased to 600 rpm, the worm-like vesicles changed into spherical vesicles. A further increase in the stirring speed to 900 rpm produced much smaller spherical vesicles. The extension of the block chains also reduced the size of the vesicles. An increase in the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic block chain varied the morphology of the vesicles. While PTPMA-b-P(MMA-r-TPMA) provided spherical vesicles, PTPMA-b-P(n-propyl methacrylate (PrMA)-r-TPMA) produced deformed vesicles accompanied by a size increase. On the other hand, PTPMA-b-P(n-butyl methacrylate (BuMA)-r-TPMA) produced much smaller vesicles. Furthermore, PTPMA-b-P(MMA-r-BuMA-r-TPMA) (MMA/BuMA = 0.487/0.513) provided a morphology similar to that formed by PTPMA-b-P(PrMA-r-TPMA) due to the negligible difference in the hydrophobic energy between Pr and Me-0.487/Bu-0.513. These observations indicated that the morphology of the vesicles was controlled by manipulating the hydrophobic energy of the hydrophobic block chain.

AB Background: Blockchain is emerging as an innovative technology for secure data management in many areas, including medical practice. A distributed blockchain network is tolerant against network fault, and the registered data are resistant to tampering and revision. The technology has a high affinity with digital medicine like mobile health (mHealth) and provides reliability to the medical data without labor-intensive third-party contributions. On the other hand, the reliability of the medical data is not insured before registration to the blockchain network. Furthermore, there are issues with regard to how the clients' mobile devices should be dealt with and authenticated in the blockchain network in order to avoid impersonation.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to design and validate an mHealth system that enables the compatibility of the security and scalability of the medical data using blockchain technology.
   Methods: We designed an mHealth system that sends medical data to the blockchain network via relay servers. The architecture provides scalability and convenience of operation of the system. In order to ensure the reliability of the data from clients' mobile devices, hash values with chain structure (client hashchain) were calculated in the clients' devices and the results were registered on the blockchain network.
   Results: The system was applied and deployed in mHealth for insomnia treatment. Clinical trials for mHealth were conducted with insomnia patients. Medical data of the recruited patients were successfully registered with the blockchain network via relay servers along with the hashchain calculated on the clients' mobile devices. The correctness of the data was validated by identifying illegal data, which were made by simulating fraudulent access.
   Conclusions: Our proposed mHealth system, blockchain combined with client hashchain, ensures compatibility of security and scalability in the data management of mHealth medical practice.

TI Design Choices and Trade-Offs in Health Care Blockchain Implementations:
   Systematic Review

AB Background: A blockchain is a list of records that uses cryptography to make stored data immutable; their use has recently been proposed for electronic medical record (EMR) systems. This paper details a systematic review of trade-offs in blockchain technologies that are relevant to EMRs. Trade-offs are defined as "a compromise between two desirable but incompatible features."
   Objective: This review's primary research question was: "What are the trade-offs involved in different blockchain designs that are relevant to the creation of blockchain-based electronic medical records systems?"
   Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Papers published from January 1, 2017 to June 15, 2018 were selected. Quality assessments of papers were performed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Critical Assessment Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Database searches identified 2885 articles, of which 15 were ultimately included for analysis.
   Results: A total of 17 trade-offs were identified impacting the design, development, and implementation of blockchain systems; these trade-offs are organized into themes, including business, application, data, and technology architecture.
   Conclusions: The key findings concluded the following: (1) multiple trade-offs can be managed adaptively to improve EMR utility; (2) multiple trade-offs involve improving the security of blockchain systems at the cost of other features, meaning EMR efficacy highly depends on data protection standards; and (3) multiple trade-offs result in improved blockchain scalability. Consideration of these trade-offs will be important to the specific environment in which electronic medical records are being developed. This review also uses its findings to suggest useful design choices for a hypothetical National Health Service blockchain.

AB Purpose This paper aims to analyze the money laundering process itself, how cryptocurrencies have been integrated into this process, and how regulatory and government bodies are responding to this new form of currency. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a theoretical paper that discusses cryptocurrencies and their role in the money laundering process. Findings Cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for intermediary financial institutions and allow direct peer-to-peer financial transactions. Because of the anonymity introduced through blockchain, cryptocurrencies have been favored by the darknet and other criminal networks. Originality/value Cryptocurrencies are a nascent form of money that first arose with the creation of bitcoin in 2009. This form of purely digital currency was meant as a direct competitor to government-backed fiat currency that are controlled by the central banking system. The paper adds to the recent discussions and debate on cryptocurrencies by suggesting additional regulation to prevent their use in money laundering and corruption schemes.

AB Edge computing provides a unified platform for computing, networking, and storage resources, enabling data to be processed in a timely and efficient manner near the source. Thus, it has become the basic platform for industrial Internet of things (IIoT). However, computing ' s unique features have also introduced new security problems. To solve the problem, in this paper, blockchain-based identity management combining access control mechanism is designed under edge computing. The self-certified cryptography is utilized to realize the registration and authentication of network entities. We bind the generated implicit certificate to its identity and construct the identity and certificate management mechanism based on blockchain. Secondly, an access control mechanism based on Bloom filter is designed and integrated with identity management. Moreover, for secure communication in resource-constrained edge devices, a lightweight secret key agreement protocol based on self-authenticated public key is constructed. These mechanisms work together to provide data security guarantees for IIoT such as authentication, auditability, and confidentiality.

AB Industry 4.0 has paved the way for a world where smart factories will automate and upgrade many processes through the use of some of the latest emerging technologies. One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios.

AB With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is getting out of its infancy, into full maturity, and tends to be developed in an explosively rapid way, with more and more data transmitted and processed. As a result, the ability to manage devices deployed worldwide has been given more and advanced requirements in practical application performances. Most existing IoT platforms are highly centralized architectures, which suffer from various technical limitations, such as a cyber-attack and single point of failure. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data accessing, while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated IoT platform using blockchain technology to guarantee sensing data integrity. The aim of this platform is to afford the device owner a practical application that provides a comprehensive, immutable log and allows easy access to their devices deployed in different domains. It also provides characteristics of general IoT systems, allows for real-time monitoring, and control between the end user and device. The business logic of the application is defined by the smart contract, which contains rules and conditions. The proposed approach is backed by a proof of concept implementation in realistic IoT scenarios, utilizing Raspberry Pi devices and a permissioned network called Hyperledger Fabric. Lastly, a benchmark study using various performance metrics is made to highlight the significance of the proposed work. The analysis results indicate that the designed platform is suitable for the resource-constrained IoT architecture and is scalable to be extended in various IoT scenarios.

AB The existing LTE mobile system uses the vertical model to handle the session-based security management. However, the goal of this paper is to propose a packet key-based security management scheme on the blockchain control plane to enhance the existing session key-based security scheme and overcome the limitation that the existing vertical model, as well as the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based horizontal model, confronts within solving end-to-end security management. The proposed blockchain-based security management (BSM) scheme enables each peer to easily obtain the necessary parameters required to manage the packet key-based security system. The important features of the BSM scheme include the renewal process, which enables the different packet data streams to use completely different security parameters for the security management. In addition, because even blind values cannot be exposed to the possible attackers, our BSM scheme guarantees very secure end-to-end data transfer against active attacks such as falsification of data and transactions. Finally, this paper compares the BSM scheme with the existing vertical model to prove the advantageous effects on latency.

AB In this paper, we present Low-Bandwidth Distributed Applications Framework (LDAF)an application-aware gateway for communication-constrained Internet of things (IoT) devices. A modular approach facilitates connecting to existing cloud backend servers and managing message formats and APIs' native application logic to meet the communication constraints of resource-limited end devices. We investigated options for positioning the LDAF server in fog computing architectures. We demonstrated the approach in three use cases: (i) a simple domain name system (DNS) query from the device to a DNS server, (ii) a complex interaction of a blockchainbased IoT device with a blockchain network, and (iii) difference based patching of binary (system) files at the IoT end devices. In a blockchain smart meter use case we effectively enabled decentralized applications (DApp) for devices that without our solution could not participate in a blockchain network. Employing the more efficient binary content encoding, we reduced the periodic traffic from 16 kB/s to similar to 1.1 kB/s, i.e., 7% of the initial traffic. With additional optimization of the application protocol in the gateway and message filtering, the periodic traffic was reduced to similar to 1% of the initial traffic, without any tradeoffs in the application's functionality or security. Using a function of binary difference we managed to reduce the size of the communication traffic to the end device, at least when the binary patch was smaller than the patching file.

AB Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are expected to play a vital role in the field of patient-health monitoring shortly. They provide a convenient way to collect patient data, but they also bring serious problems which are mainly reflected in the safe storage of the collected data. The privacy and security of data storage in WBAN devices cannot meet the needs of WBAN users. Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user's data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN. In addition, the new signature scheme can also compress the size of the blockchain storage space.

AB In order to build a local electricity market (LEM), community members can trade electricity peer-to-peer (P2P) with their neighbors. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Bidding and Transaction Structure based on blockchain (HBTS). First, combined with the multi-agents, each microgrid corrects the estimated cost probability distribution of other microgrids by Bayesian theorem, making its probability closer to the accurate probability. Second, for maximize the benefits of the microgrid, this paper uses the Nash equilibrium in the Cournot model to find the optimal quotation and output of different bidding strategies for the microgrid under different power demand conditions. Then the exchange of electricity translates into an exchange of digital proof of electricity purchases and sales of electricity on the Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring the security of the transaction process and the irreparable modification of ledgers. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the bidding strategy through experiments, and analyze the transaction process.

AB The article introduces a classification of research programs related to the cryptocurrency market. Each of them is surveyed, with the emphasis placed on the most recent studies. Despite the presence of market frictions, its informational efficiency tends to increase, thereby making it more comparable with the conventional financial markets. In particular, cryptocurrencies can be used for portfolio diversification. Yet, they can hardly compete with fiat money. Currently, central banks are only interested in examining and adopting some of the cryptocurrency features to create their own wholesale digital currencies.

TI Fine-Grained, Secure and Efficient Data Provenance on Blockchain Systems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bring enormous interest to blockchains. A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing.
   We present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes provenance information to smart contracts via simple and elegant interfaces, thereby enabling a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution, and efficiently stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for supporting efficient provenance query processing. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Hyperledger and a blockchain-optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its efficient query, and its small storage overhead.

TI A Blockchain-based Value Added Tax (VAT) System: Saudi Arabia as a
   Use-Case

AB Businesses need trust to confidently perform trade among each other. Centralized business models are the only mature solutions available to perform trades over the Internet. However, they have many problems which includes but are not limited to the fact that these create bottleneck on the server as well as requires trusted third parties. Recently, decentralized solutions have gained significant popularity and acceptance for future businesses. The wide acceptance of such systems is indeed due to the trust management among various untrusted business stakeholders. Many solutions have been proposed in this regard to provide de-centralized infrastructure for various business models. A standard solution that is acceptable to the industry is still in demand. Hyperledger umbrella Blockchain projects, that are supported by IBM and many other industry big players are gaining popularity due to its efficient and pluggable design. In this study, the author present the idea of utilizing Blockchain to design a Value-Added Tax (VAT) system for Saudi Arabia's newly introduced tax system. The reason to select this business model for VAT is twofold. First, it provides an untampered distributed ledger, which cannot be deceived by any party. Each transaction in the system cannot go unnoticed by the smart contract. Secondly, it provides a transparent record, and updates all involved parties regarding each activity performed by stakeholders. The newly proposed system will provide a transparent database of VAT transactions according to our smart contract design and at each stage of supply chain, tax will be deducted and stored on peer-to-peer network via consensus process. The author believes that the proposed solution will have significant impact on VAT collection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

ID TECHNOLOGIES; SECURITY; FUTURE
AB Blockchain is an emerging field which works on the concept of a digitally distributed ledger and consensus algorithm removing all the threats of intermediaries. Its early applications were related to the finance sector but now this concept has been extended to almost all the major areas of research including education, IoT, banking, supplychain, defense, governance, healthcare, etc. In the field of healthcare, stakeholders (provider, patient, payer, research organizations, and supply chain bearers) demand interoperability, security, authenticity, transparency, and streamlined transactions. Blockchain technology, built over the internet, has the potential to use the current healthcare data into peer to peer and interoperable manner by using a patient-centric approach eliminating the third party. Using this technology, applications can be built to manage and share secure, transparent and immutable audit trails with reduced systematic fraud. This study reviews existing literature in order to identify the major issues of various healthcare stakeholders and to explore the features of blockchain technology that could resolve identified issues. However, there are some challenges and limitations of this technology which are needed to be focused on future research.

TI Assuring Non-fraudulent Transactions in Cash on Delivery by Introducing
   Double Smart Contracts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS

DE Cash on Delivery (COD); Blockchain; smart contract; Ethereum;
   e-commerce; online payment
AB The adoption of decentralized cryptocurrency platforms is growing fast, thanks to the implementation of Blockchain technology and smart contracts. It encourages the novel frameworks in a wide range of applications including finance and payment methods such as cash on delivery. However, a large number of smart contracts developed for cash on delivery suffer from fraudulent transactions which enable malicious participants to break the signed contracts without sufficient penalties. A shipper will involve in the system and place a mortgage to ensure reliability. A buyer also pledges an amount of money when making the order. Our process not only ensures the interests of a seller but also prevents a fraud shipper. The penalties will be made in two scenarios: (i) the buyer refuses to receive the commodities without any reliable reasons; and (ii) the shipper attempts to make any modification on the delivered goods during transportation. To help developers create more secure and reliable cash on delivery system, we introduce double smart contracts, a framework rooted in Blockchain technology and Ethereum, to tackle those mentioned problems. We also contribute our solution as an open source software that developers can easily add to their implementation to enhance functionality.

AB Blockchain is a distributed network based ledger that is secured by the methods of cryptographic proof. It enables the creation of self-executable digital contracts i.e. smart contracts. This technology is working in collaboration with major areas of research including governance, IoT, health, banking and education. It has anticipated revolutionary ways, which helps us to overcome the problems of governance such as human error, voting, privacy of data, security and food safety. In governance, there is a need to ameliorate the services and facilities with the assistance of blockchain technology. This paper aims to explore the issues of governance which can be resolved with the assistance of Blockchain features. Furthermore this paper also provides the future work directions.

AB Being a driving force behind the development of various social relations, the intensification of modern technologies forms new conditions for modernizing democratic institutions. Different innovations in the field of digital communications affect mechanisms for the realization of political rights and freedoms of a person and citizen, transform activities of public authorities and tools of their interaction with civil society institutions. In these conditions, innovations influence even traditional areas, including popular voting and lawmaking. The active introduction of distributed registry technologies affected the development of new methodological approaches and reformed the organization of elections. This technology has widespread use due to blockchain technology. Although it was initially considered as an element of development in the information and financial spheres, now blockchain is gradually entering other spheres of human activity, including political, due to the high degree of security and confidentiality. This paper analyzes the global practice of using this technology in popular voting and legislative procedures. The authors of the article consider technical solutions applied in the most rapidly growing projects aimed to develop their own software for conducting electronic election powered by a blockchain technology. Special attention is paid to the legal security of voting by secret ballot and the identification of voters in the conditions of applying these technologies.

TI Clouded data: Privacy and the promise of encryption

DT Article

AB Personal data is highly vulnerable to security exploits, spurring moves to lock it down through encryption, to cryptographically 'cloud' it. But personal data is also highly valuable to corporations and states, triggering moves to unlock its insights by relocating it in the cloud. We characterise this twinned condition as 'clouded data'. Clouded data constructs a political and technological notion of privacy that operates through the intersection of corporate power, computational resources and the ability to obfuscate, gain insights from and valorise a dependency between public and private. First, we survey prominent clouded data approaches (blockchain, multiparty computation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption), suggesting their particular affordances produce distinctive versions of privacy. Next, we perform two notional code-based experiments using synthetic datasets. In the field of health, we submit a patient's blood pressure to a notional cloud-based diagnostics service; in education, we construct a student survey that enables aggregate reporting without individual identification. We argue that these technical affordances legitimate new political claims to capture and commodify personal data. The final section broadens the discussion to consider the political force of clouded data and its reconstitution of traditional notions such as the public and the private.

TI A Novel Medical Blockchain Model for Drug Supply Chain Integrity
   Management in a Smart Hospital
SO ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
DE healthcare; drug supply chain; distributed ledger; blockchain;
   Hyperledger Fabric
AB At present, in pharmacology one of the most serious problems is counterfeit drugs. The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10-30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a remarkable data producer and these data may be used to prevent or detect security vulnerabilities and increase productivity by the adoption of statistical and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. However, these desirable benefits are gained if data from IoT networks are dependablethis is where blockchain comes into play. In fact, through blockchain, critical IoT data may be trusted, i.e., considered valid for any subsequent processing. A simple formal model named the Mirror Model is proposed to connect IoT data organized in traditional models to assets of trust in a blockchain. The Mirror Model sets some formal conditions to produce trusted data that remain trusted over time. A possible practical implementation of an application programming interface (API) is proposed, which keeps the data and the trust model in synch. Finally, it is noted that the Mirror Model enforces a top-down approach from reality to implementation instead of going the opposite way as it is now the practice when referring to blockchain and the IoT.

TI A Proof-of-Trust Consensus Protocol for Enhancing Accountability in

DT Article
DE Accountability; blockchain; byzantine agreement; crowdsourcing;
   consensus; PoT; PoW; PoS
AB Incorporating accountability mechanisms in online services requires effective trust management and immutable, traceable source of truth for transaction evidence. The emergence of the blockchain technology brings in high hopes for fulfilling most of those requirements. However, a major challenge is to find a proper consensus protocol that is applicable to the crowdsourcing services in particular and online services in general. Building upon the idea of using blockchain as the underlying technology to enable tracing transactions for service contracts and dispute arbitration, this paper proposes a novel consensus protocol that is suitable for the crowdsourcing as well as the general online service industry. The new consensus protocol is called "Proof-of-Trust" (PoT) consensus; it selects transaction validators based on the service participants' trust values while leveraging RAFT leader election and Shamir's secret sharing algorithms. The PoT protocol avoids the low throughput and resource intensive pitfalls associated with Bitcoin' s "Proof-of-Work" (PoW) mining, while addressing the scalability issue associated with the traditional Paxos-based and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based algorithms. In addition, it addresses the unfaithful behaviors that cannot be dealt with in the traditional BFT algorithms. The paper demonstrates that our approach can provide a viable accountability solution for the online service industry.

TI Assessing Blockchain Consensus and Security Mechanisms against the 51%
   Attack
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
LA English
DT Article
DE 51% attack; double-spending; security techniques; consensus mechanism
AB The 51% attack is a technique which intends to fork a blockchain in order to conduct double-spending. Adversaries controlling more than half of the total hashing power of a network can perform this attack. In a similar way, n confirmation and selfish mining are two attack techniques that comprise a similar strategy to the 51% attack. Due to the immense attacking cost to perform the 51% attack, it was considered very unlikely for a long period. However, in recent times, the attack has befallen at a frequent pace, costing millions of dollars to various cryptocurrencies. The 51% attack strategy varies based upon the adopted consensus mechanism by a particular cryptocurrency, and it enables attackers to double-spend the same crypto-coin, restrict transactions, cancel blocks, and even have full control over the price of a cryptocurrency. A crypto-coin with a low hashing power is always jeopardized by the 51% attack due to the easily attainable hashing. In this paper, we analyze the real impact of the 51% attack, revealing serious weaknesses in consensus protocols that made this attack possible. We discuss the five most advanced protection techniques to prevent this attack and their main limitations. We conclude that in most cases, security techniques fail to provide real protection against the 51% attack because the weaknesses are inherited from the consensus protocols.

AB Blockchain and AI are promising techniques for next-generation wireless networks. Blockchain can establish a secure and decentralized resource sharing environment. Al can be explored to solve problems with uncertain, time-variant, and complex features. Both of these techniques have recently seen a surge in interest. The integration of these two techniques can further enhance the performance of wireless networks. In this article, we first propose a secure and intelligent architecture for next-generation wireless networks by integrating AI and blockchain into wireless networks to enable flexible and secure resource sharing. Then we propose a blockchain empowered content caching problem to maximize system utility, and develop a new caching scheme by utilizing deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

DT Article
DE blockchain; consensus; cryptocurrency
AB The Bitcoin cryptocurrency allows entities in a peer-to-peer network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain through a set of cryptographic algorithms and economic incentives. Bitcoin uses a proof of work system, but there are other consensus mechanisms used by other cryptocurrencies. The performance of a cryptocurrency depends on the consensus mechanism used. This paper presents the results of a comparative evaluation that has been conducted on various significant consensus mechanisms. The unique characteristics, as well as drawbacks of each mechanism, are highlighted, together with their applications. The mechanisms are also classified into major types and those types are evaluated elaborately. The paper concludes with a discussion of the open challenges related to the available solutions.

AB Edge cloud architectures provide a layer between centralized clouds and the IoT and sensor space. In this intermediate layer, we find devices of different types that manage the communication with sensors and cloud services, but also process data from sensors locally without access to the cloud. In order to support the flexible creation, placement and usage of data and software resources in this layer, advanced orchestration techniques need to include communication and processing activities. These architectures often stretch cross organizational boundaries, causing trust concerns regarding secure data storage and the management of the identity of sensors and also the origin of data. We present an ontology-based semantic pattern that semantically defines trusted orchestration for edge clouds by linking a trust ontology to an architecture pattern and that allows reasoning about essential trust properties.

ID FRAMEWORK; INTERNET; THINGS
AB With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), traditional industries are setting off a massive wave of digitization. In the era of the Internet of Everything, millions of devices and links in IoT pose more significant challenges to data management. Most existing solutions employ centralized systems to control IoT devices, which brings about the privacy and security issues in IoT data management. Recently, blockchain has attracted much attention in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, and non-tamperability. However, it is non-trivial to apply the current blockchain techniques to IoT due to the lack of scalability and high resource costs. Different blockchain platforms have their particular advantages in the scenario of IoT data management. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain framework to integrate multiple blockchains for efficient and secure IoT data management. Our solution builds an interactive decentralized access model which employs a consortium blockchain as the control station. Other blockchain platforms customized for specific IoT scenarios run as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channels on the consortium blockchain. Our model merges transactions in these channels for confirmation based on the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model based on hyperledge Fabric and IOTA Tangle. We evaluate the performance of our method through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

AB This paper introduces a decentralized market design, which allows a distribution system operator to manage local demand constraints by obtaining flexibility from competing aggregators, which must in-turn incentivize prosumers to provide this flexibility. The novel networked market structure accounts for distribution system operator-to-aggregator and aggregator-to-prosumer ICT infrastructure and contractual arrangements, which may limit which participants can negotiate transactions with one another. The proposed flexibility market is opt-in for prosumers, which continue to obtain energy within the existing retail electricity market. At the same time, it is underpinned by bilateral energy transactions, and could be integrated into future peer-to-peer electricity markets. Through the market, the distribution system operator, aggregators, and prosumers reach agreement on a stable outcome-a set of individually beneficial transactions no group wishes to mutually deviate from. Market outcomes also satisfy Pareto efficiency, meaning that it is not possible to make a participant better off, without making another worse off.

AB Blockchain technologies are benefiting from significant interest in both societal and business contexts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have grown rapidly in user adoption over the past 8 years. However, blockchain technologies, which fuel cryptocurrencies, have the potential to extend to other business applications even more profoundly. Blockchain can be leveraged to drive innovation and increase efficiencies in new domains including digital arts management, supply chains, and healthcare-but there remain technical, organizational, and regulatory head winds that must be overcome before mass adoption can occur. In this article, we provide a brief history of blockchain and identify some of the key features that have enabled its popular uptake in the world of cryptocurrencies. We discuss how blockchain technologies have evolved from traditional software and web technologies and then examine their underlying strengths and evaluate new, noncryptocurrency use cases. We conclude with a look at the limitations of blockchain and present several important factors for managers considering blockchain implementation within their organizations.

AB In a global marketplace, customers are often unaware of the exact sources of the products they purchase and consume. To address this lack of awareness, blockchain technology can be implemented in supply chains to increase customers' knowledge of products' provenance. Provenance knowledge information about products' origin, production, modifications, and custody enables customers to be assured of their purchasing decisions. This assurance comes from information on the origin, authenticity, custody, and integrity of the product that helps reduce risk perceptions. We develop a provenance knowledge framework and show how its application can enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain. We present a guide on how to implement blockchain to establish provenance knowledge and close with a kind warning on the importance of demonstrating the value of blockchain to customers.

AB Much of the attention surrounding blockchain today is focused on financial services, with very little discussion about nonfinancial services firms and how blockchain technology may affect organizations, their business models, and how they create and deliver value. In addition, some confusion remains between the block chain (with definite article) and blockchain (no article), distributed ledger technologies, and their applications. Our article offers a primer on blockchain technology aimed at general managers and executives. The key contributions of this article lie in providing an explanation of blockchain, including how a blockchain transaction works and a clarification of terms, and outlining different types of blockchain technologies. We also discuss how different types of blockchain impact business models. Building on the well-established business model framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur, we outline the effect that blockchain technologies can have on each element of the business model, along with illustrations from firms developing blockchain technology.

AB The ongoing discussion regarding blockchain technologies is focused primarily on cryptocurrencies, but blockchain features and functionalities have developed beyond financial instruments. As the technologies provide new functionalities, the associated value proposition changes as well. This study explores the relationship between blockchain technologies and their underlying value drivers. Four identified distinct blockchain stages of increased maturity are analyzed and discussed. This covers the evolutionary technology types focused on transactions, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and the introduction of artificial intelligence supporting decentralized decision making. In addition, we address management issues around appropriate blockchain adoption using a blockchain value driver-focused framework that gives decision makers actionable questions and recommendations. We provide practitioners with a method for assessing suitable blockchain adoption that addresses the specific value creation associated with a given organizational strategy. For academics, we critically identify and assess the characteristics of the blockchain stages and their strategy implications and provide a structured approach conceptualizing blockchain technology evolution.

AB The goal of this paper is to analyze blockchain technology and how it can have an innovative effect on companies' communication with their customers. We also analyze possible changes that this technology could set off in digital marketing. Some of the hypotheses in this paper are in an initial state, pending subsequent verification and experimentation.
   We seek to analyze the current problems of marketing from the perspective of users and of the companies that make ads, and we propose a possible scenario of how blockchain can have an impact on several sectors.
   It may be concluded that blockchain has great potential in the different fields that can be used for marketing in a company. Its major contributions may be focused on digital marketing since it can solve privacy problems to a large extent. Moreover, it can help to improve the accuracy and orientation of advertising.

AB The cyber security of modern power systems has drawn increasing attention in both academia and industry. Many detection and defense methods for cyber-attacks have therefore been proposed to enhance robustness of modern power systems. In this paper, we propose a new, distributed blockchain-based protection framework to enhance the self-defensive capability of modern power systems against cyber-attacks. We present a comprehensive discussion on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance the robustness and security of the power grid, by using meters as nodes in a distributed network which encapsulates meter measurements as blocks. Effectiveness of the proposed protection framework is demonstrated via simulation experiments on the IEEE-118 benchmark system.

TI Securing light clients in blockchain with DLCP
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In blockchain, full nodes (FNs) are peers that store and verify entire chains of transactions. In contrast, light clients (LCs) are those with limited resources, and for this reason, they request only block headers from FNs for transaction verification-using protocols like Simple Payment Verification (SPV). In an approach to prevent FN tampering on transaction verification (byzantine fault), LCs request block headers from multiple FNs and compare received responses. One problem with this approach is that an LC must connect to each FN and perform the same cryptographic operations with each one repeatedly, which leads to client-side complexity and slower response. We propose an alternate approach to tackle this issue, in which LCs can encrypt a request for block headers only once, and send that request to a predetermined set of FNs to access, process, and reply back in a single response. Our approach, called Distributed Lightweight Client Protocol (DLCP), enables LCs to verify with little effort if FNs have agreed on a response. From an experimental evaluation, we observed that DLCP provided lower latency and reduced computing and communication overhead in comparison with the existing conventional approach.

TI Blockchain and smart contracts for higher education registry in Brazil
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNET; BITCOIN
AB The validation of academic credits and issuance of academic degree certificates in the Brazilian education system currently occurs in a semi or completely noncomputerized way. The actual digitization of this system could make it more secure and decrease bureaucracy in terms of document validation, saving in storage and labor. Due to the recent increase in forgeries and loss of records, it is paramount that this process becomes more transparent and reliable for all involved parties. This article presents a proposal and an implementation for the digitization of degree certificates and academic credits for higher education in the Brazilian education system. A transparent model based on blockchain is proposed, in which higher education institutions register students and their academic credits in a chain of records using the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure for identity management. This information, associated with smart contracts, enables the reliable and decentralized issuance of degree certificates through the validation of a historical database and the triggering of transactions using smart contracts. The focus of this article is the demonstration of an experiment that validates this proposal.

AB This research uses sensemaking theory to explore how emerging blockchain technology may transform supply chains. We investigate three research questions (RQs): What are blockchain technology's perceived benefits to supply chains, where are disruptions mostly likely to occur and what are the potential challenges to further blockchain diffusion? We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts. Cognitive mapping and narrative analysis were deployed as the two main data analysis techniques to aid our understanding and evaluation of people's cognitive complexity in making sense of blockchain technology. We found that individual experts developed different cognitive structures within their own sensemaking processes. After merging individual cognitive maps into a strategic map, we identified several themes and central concepts that then allowed us to explore potential answers to the three RQs. Our study is among the very few to date to explicitly explore how blockchains may transform supply chain practices. Using the sensemaking approach afforded a deeper understanding of how senior executives diagnose the symptoms evident from blockchains and develop assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the technology, which will then shape their future actions regarding its utilisation. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensemaking theory as an alternative lens in investigating contemporary supply chain phenomena such as blockchains. Bringing sensemaking theory to this discipline in particular enriches emerging behavioural operations research. Our contributions also lie in extending the theories of prospective sensemaking and adding further insights to the stream of technology adoption studies.

AB Blockchains are distributed ledgers, operated within peer-to-peer networks. We model the proof-of-work blockchain protocol as a stochastic game and analyze the equilibrium strategies of rational, strategic miners. Mining the longest chain is a Markov perfect equilibrium, without forking, in line with Nakamoto (2008). The blockchain protocol, however, is a coordination game, with multiple equilibria. There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades. Last we identify negative externalities implying that equilibrium investment in computing capacity is excessive. Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision July 6, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

TI Blockchain-Based Settlement for Asset Trading
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Can securities be settled on a blockchain, and, if so, what are the gains relative to existing settlement systems? The main benefit of a blockchain is faster and more flexible settlement, whereas settlement fails need to be ruled out where participants fork the chain to cancel trading losses. With a proof-of-work protocol, the blockchain needs to restrict settlement speed through block size and time in order to generate transaction fees, which finance costly mining. Despite mining being a deadweight cost, our estimates for the U.S. corporate debt market yield net gains from a blockchain in the range of 1-4 bps. Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision May 29, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.

TI Blockchain Disruption and Smart Contracts
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPARENCY
AB Blockchain technology provides decentralized consensus and potentially enlarges the contracting space through smart contracts. Meanwhile, generating decentralized consensus entails distributing information that necessarily alters the informational environment. We analyze how decentralization relates to consensus quality and how the quintessential features of blockchain remold the landscape of competition. Smart contracts can mitigate informational asymmetry and improve welfare and consumer surplus through enhanced entry and competition, yet distributing information during consensus generation may encourage greater collusion. In general, blockchains sustain market equilibria with a wider range of economic outcomes. We further discuss the implications for antitrust policies targeted at blockchain applications.

AB We provide large-scale evidence on the occurrence and value of FinTech innovation. Using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies. We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

AB This paper discusses the emergence of blockchain technology in the energy sector in the light of ongoing energy market transformation. The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia.

TI Using Blockchains to Implement Distributed Measuring Systems

AB In recent years, measuring instruments have become quite complex due to the integration of embedded systems and software components and the increasing aggregation of new features. Consequently, metrological regulation and control require more efforts from notified bodies, becoming slower and more expensive. In this paper, we evaluate the use of blockchains as a resource to overcome such challenges. We start with a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models discussed in previous works. We also made a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchain-based measuring systems can impact the way measuring instruments are used in consumer relations while improving security and simplifying metrological regulation and control. We implement a vehicle speed measuring system using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. We evaluate the security and performance of our blockchain-based measuring system by executing tests with data from real speed meter sensors. The results are promising and validate the feasibility of our idea. Finally, we point out the main challenges related to our approach, suggesting alternatives and potential issues to be addressed by future works.

TI Fair compute loads enabled by blockchain: sharing models by alternating

ID DIAGNOSIS; ONLINE
AB Objective: Decentralized privacy-preserving predictive modeling enables multiple institutions to learn a more generalizable model on healthcare or genomic data by sharing the partially trained models instead of patient-level data, while avoiding risks such as single point of control. State-of-the-art blockchain-based methods remove the server role but can be less accurate than models that rely on a server. Therefore, we aim at developing a general model sharing framework to preserve predictive correctness, mitigate the risks of a centralized architecture, and compute the models in a fair way. Materials and Methods: We propose a framework that includes both server and client roles to preserve correctness. We adopt a blockchain network to obtain the benefits of decentralization, by alternating the roles for each site to ensure computational fairness. Also, we developed GloreChain (Grid Binary LOgistic REgression on Permissioned BlockChain) as a concrete example, and compared it to a centralized algorithm on 3 healthcare or genomic datasets to evaluate predictive correctness, number of learning iterations and execution time. Results: GloreChain performs exactly the same as the centralized method in terms of correctness and number of iterations. It inherits the advantages of blockchain, at the cost of increased time to reach a consensus model. Discussion: Our framework is general or flexible and can also address intrinsic challenges of blockchain networks. Further investigations will focus on higher-dimensional datasets, additional use cases, privacy-preserving quality concerns, and ethical, legal, and social implications. Conclusions: Our framework provides a promising potential for institutions to learn a predictive model based on healthcare or genomic data in a privacy-preserving and decentralized way.

AB Blockchain (BC) represents a distributed ledger technology that has been utilized for providing security and privacy in distributed networks. This makes it applicable to the distributed nature of IoT, which still suffers from privacy and security vulnerabilities. However, the core BC technology is computationally expensive and commonly involves high bandwidth overhead and delays not suitable for IoT related scenarios. In order to foster the synergy between BC and IoT, recent research advancements have specifically focused on developing novel BC approaches that are tailored to the requirements and needs of the specific IoT use cases. The paper elaborates the BC-IoT related issues and provides a comprehensive survey of the current literature and relevant initiated deployments. The paper also identifies the key research and development challenges and discusses the possible aspects for future research.

AB One of the pressing legal questions of the energy transition is how to integrate 1,rosumers", consumers who start producing electricity, in the electricity market. So far, their influence remains limited or fully absent because their role as independent market participants is barely or not facilitated as they are usually subject to regulated remuneration schemes. Blockchain technology offers changing the approach of "integration in the market" into "becoming the market" by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. Currently, transactions are facilitated by third parties, suppliers and system operators, whose main task is centrally compiling and coordinating information on loads and generation and contracting supply and distribution services. Instead, blockchain technology enables new ways of organising decentralised persons without the immediate need for one centrally connecting entity. This implies profound legal- and policy consequences. Based on information on first use cases of blockchain applications in the electricity sector, this article identifies those main policy implications for EU electricity law and thereby adds to the discussion how blockchain technology could facilitate `rosumers" to develop as independent market participants in the electricity sector from an energy law perspective.

AB As the first and last line of defence in many cases, authentication is a crucial part of a system. With authentication, any unauthorised access to the system can be prevented. This work maps the research landscape through two means. The first is a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain technology in authentication over networking. The second is identification of different types of authentication systems under various platforms that use blockchain technology. This work also provides useful and classified information which can enhance the understanding of how various authentication systems can be combined with blockchain technology. In addition, problems associated with this blockchain technology and proposed solutions are surveyed to fulfil the requirements of the network applications. Moreover, this work highlights the importance, capabilities, motivations and challenges of blockchain technology with distinct applications in various fields. Finally, recommendations and future research directions are discussed.

LA English

DE Crowdsensing; Privacy-preserving; Location privacy; Blockchain
AB With the support of portable electronic devices and crowdsensing, a new class of mobile applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) application is emerging. Crowdsensing enables workers with mobile devices to travel to specified locations and collect data, then send it back to the requester for rewards. However, the majority of the existing crowdsensing systems are based on centralized servers, which are prone to a high chance of attack, intrusion, and manipulation. Further, during the process of transmitting information to and from the service server, the worker's location is usually exposed. This raises the potential risk of a privacy infringement. In this paper, we first identify three ways locations can be disclosed in traditional crowdsensing systems. Then, we propose a novel solution, dubbed a blockchain privacy-preservation crowdsensing system, to address these privacy problems. The proposed system not only protects the privacy of worker locations but also increases the success rate of completing the assigned task. Specifically, the system entails a rewards-based task assignment process that, essentially, markets the given assignment and uses the anonymized characteristics of blockchain technology to hide the identity information of users. To prevent attacks through re-identification, we have introduced a private blockchain to distribute the worker's transaction records. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONSENSUS
AB Cyber-physical systems combine physical objects or systems with integrated computational facilities and data storage. From that perspective, Smart Grids are a mixture of physical actuators, sensors, physical communication networks; and cyber computational and communication protocols and algorithms. In our work, we propose to extend the applicability of decentralized blockchain consensus protocols to the broad field of Cyber-Physical systems. Our contribution includes a proposal of a new family of cyber-physical systems, an in-depth discussion of new possibilities and inherent shortcomings. The proposed coupling of the data storage mechanisms, communication and consensus protocols, allows for deployment of self-sustaining cyber-physical environments in which all the mission-critical aspects in both the cyber and physical layer are effectively incentivized, coordinated and maintained. This includes the essential data storage, data exchange, but also the production, transmission and distribution of energy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first such a comprehensive undertaking toward symbiotic cyber-physical systems and environments. The proposed family of systems is decentralized and does not imply the necessity of reliance on trusted third parties. We propose and discuss an architecture which incorporates physical, blockchain-enabled sensors and actuators capable of monitoring and altering parameters of the underlying physical layer. We analyze a particular instance of a blockchain-aided CPS', where we are concerned with the power grid at both the micro and macro-grid level. At the macro-grid level we explore the possibility of utilizing blockchain-enabled physical actuators. These theoretical actuators are able to introduce savings by a near real-time routing of energy and enable for tracking of power losses thanks to decentralized accountability. At the micro-grid level we propose a network of blockchain-enabled smart meters to coordinate real-time auction-based energy trade. To glue together the elements of such an open, trustless, decentralized system, we discuss an intrinsic communication protocol capable of rewarding intermediaries of a data exchange for each transmitted byte. We tackle the feasibility, security and accountability challenges which we have faced and which will need to be considered by future architects of the new, exciting family of cyber-physical systems.

AB Block withholding attack is an action where a miner who has found a legal block chooses not to submit it but rather directly abandons it. This attack makes the mining pool lose all bitcoin rewards contained within the block. In this paper, we construct a generalized model where two participants can choose to either cooperate with each other or employ a block withholding attack in the mining pool. To make the model more realistic, we consider both the cost of partial proof of work and the cost of cooperation. We also calculate the reward-per-time instead of profit-per-time to better measure the payoffs of each party. Further, we discuss the case where the payoff function and cost function are directly related to the computational power. The pure strategy and mixed strategy are analyzed respectively and the segmentations of the equilibrium are shown. We demonstrate that increasing the information asymmetry by utilizing information conceal mechanisms could lower the occurrence of the BWH attack.

AB Saudi Arabia is the home for annual Hajj and ongoing Umrah pilgrimages. About eight million people from nearly two hundred countries perform these pilgrimages. To perform hajj, it is mandatory for a pilgrim to acquire a valid permit. The hajj permits are regulated by the Hajj Ministry of Saudi Arabia. Foreign pilgrims also require a valid visa to travel to Saudi Arabia. Foreigners in these pilgrimages constitute more than eighty percent of all pilgrims. Due to high demand, there is a quota for each country and also a moratorium of five years for individuals to perform Hajj. Similar restrictions are also in place for Umrah pilgrims. To obtain a permit, a pilgrim must furnish a health certificate and meet other criteria. In the past some cases of fake permits have been caught; and so, preventing and controlling this activity is an immediate need for hajj management. In this paper we propose the use of modern technologies to control and mange permits and visas efficiently. In particular, we propose a system that would use the Blockchain technology and smart contract platform to better manage the Hajj and Umrah permits and visas grants which would also efficiently address the problems of fake documents. As Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 calls for increasing the number of pilgrims to thirty million, our research is a timely solution to combat the menace of fake documents.

AB Blockchain systems are a fast emerging and a currently widely discussed novel strategy for a decentralized cryptographically enhanced digital ledger recording transactions among stakeholders. This perspective paper looks at its potential uses in the context of high value and mostly low volume botanical material traded globally and used as medicines, health foods, in cosmetics and other applications. We offer a perspective on key areas in the supply of such products globally and how blockchain systems may help in sustainable sourcing, quality assurance, and in tackling supply problems in cases of complex multiherbal preparations. Both open and closed blockchain systems are feasible, and it seems likely that, at least in the initial development, closed ones are the main ones to be utilized. While blockchain's potential is not yet clear, the examples presented here highlight the opportunities of this new technology.

AB The growing demand for human-independent comfortable lifestyle has emboldened the development of smart home. A typical keenly intellective home includes many Internet of things contrivances that engender processes and immensely colossal data to efficiently handle its users' demands. This incrementing demand raises a plethora of concern cognate to a smart home system in terms of scalability, efficiency, and security. All these issues are tedious to manage, and the existing studies lack the granularity for surmounting them. Considering such a requisite of security and efficiency as a quandary at hand, this article presents a secure and efficient smart home architecture, which incorporates the blockchain and the cloud computing technologies for a cumulated solution. Because of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it can serve the processing services and make the transaction copy of the collected sensible user data from smart home. To ensure the security of smart home network, our proposed model utilizes the multivariate correlation analysis technique to analyze the network traffic and identify the correlation between traffic features. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture using different parameters like throughput and discovered that blockchain is an efficient security solution for the future Internet of things network.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have transformed the smart transportation sector by providing diverse energy management solutions to the smart grid. Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DT Editorial Material
AB The rapid growth of cryptocurrency with computationally intensive mining processes has significantly impacted global energy use. Recently in Frontiers in Energy Research, Zade and colleagues developed a generalized scenario model to evaluate the power demand of proof of work blockchain mining. It was determined that mining algorithmic complexity-not advances in hardware efficiency-is the prime factor determining the energy consumption of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain applications must transition from proof of work toward energy-efficient consensus algorithms to be sustainable.

AB Secure data distribution is critical for data accountability. Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers. This study presents personal data sharing, deleting, modifying and tracking features to verify the privacy of proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system.

AB Three-dimensional electron microscopy techniques like electron tomography provide valuable insights into cellular structures, and present significant challenges for data storage and dissemination. Here we explored a novel method to publicly release more than 11,000 such datasets, more than 30 TB in total, collected by our group. Our method, based on a peer-to-peer file sharing network built around a blockchain ledger, offers a distributed solution to data storage. In addition, we offer a user-friendly browser-based interface, https://etdb.caltech.edu, for anyone interested to explore and download our data. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of this system and provide tools for other groups to mine our data and/or use the same approach to share their own imaging datasets.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for autonomous cars to establish trusted parties by combining distributed ledgers and self-driving cars in the traffic to provide single version of the truth and thus build public trust. Design/methodology/approach The model, which the authors call Witness of Things, is based on keeping decision logs of autonomous vehicles in distributed ledgers through the use of vehicular networks and vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure (or vice versa) communications. The model provides a single version of the truth and thus helps enable the autonomous vehicle industry, related organizations and governmental institutions to discover the true causes of road accidents and their consequences in investigations. Findings In this paper, the authors explored one of the potential effects of blockchain protocol on autonomous vehicles. The framework provides a solution for operating autonomous cars in an untrusted environment without needing a central authority. The model can also be generalized and applied to other intelligent unmanned systems. Originality/value This study proposes a blockchain protocol-based record-keeping model for autonomous cars to establish trusted parties in the traffic and protect single version of the truth.

AB The developments of Narrow Band Internet of Things have attracted much attention from both academia and industry nowadays. While Narrow Band Internet of Things is gradually designed for commercial applications, it also confronts with several security concerns such as identification and privacy. Blockchain technique is equipped with authentication, auditing, and accountability, and thus it can serve as a promising tool for providing secure data communication on the network. To enhance the security level and achieve reliable data authentication and accountability for Narrow Band Internet of Things system, in this article, we combine the merits of blockchain technique and propose a blockchain-based architecture for Narrow Band Internet of Things. The presented architecture consists of three layers which are sensing layer, transport layer, and transaction layer. We describe the interaction processes between each layer in detail and construct the algorithms which are used to conduct data authentication and blockchain generation. By evaluation, our scheme is demonstrated to obtain favorable performances in terms of privacy, authentication, accountability, and efficiency, which makes it an appropriate method to be applied for secure data communication in Narrow Band Internet of Things systems.

AB Although blockchain has attracted a great deal of attention from academia and industry there is a lack of studies on acceptance drivers. This study explores blockchain acceptance by mining the collective intelligence of users on Twitter. It maps blockchain user acceptance drivers to technology acceptance constructs. The analysis shows that users are attracted by security, privacy, transparency, trust and traceability aspects provided by blockchain. On Twitter more discussions on blockchain benefits than on drawbacks. Initial coin offering (ICO) is extensively discussed. The study provides guidelines for managers and concludes by presenting the limitations of the study along with future research directions.

AB I analyze cryptocurrency ecosystems with Elinor Ostrom's meta-framework for self-governance. I conclude that Bitcoin falls short in its self-governing ambitions, while cryptocurrency software protocols and blockchain technologies have potentialities within "permissioned" peer-to-peer private or hybrid networks. However, regulation and supervision by trusted third parties are required.

AB Blockchain technology (BT) is expected to bring a revolutionary paradigm shift in the manner the transactions are carried in the supply chains. BT provides better visibility and transparency by removing the disadvantages of trust related issues in a supply chain. In this paper, we advance the literature on BT and its adoption in the supply chain by developing, and statistically validating a model for understanding the user perceptions on BT adoption. The model is based on the integration of three adoption theories- technology acceptance model (TAM), technology readiness index (TRI) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Based on a survey of 181 supply chain practitioners in India the proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that the TRI constructs- Insecurity and discomfort have an insignificant effect on the perceived ease of use and usefulness. Perceived usefulness, attitude, and perceived behavioural control affect the behavioural intention. Subjective norm has a negligible impact on behavioural intention. This is one of the preliminary studies on BT adoption in supply chain and the findings imply that the supply chain practitioners perceive BT adoption free of efforts and would help them to derive maximum benefits for improving the supply chain effectiveness.

AB Globalisation of supply chains makes their management and control more difficult. Blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability, and security, is showing promise for easing some global supply chain management problems. In this paper, blockchain technology and smart contracts are critically examined with potential application to supply chain management. Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management.

AB The circular economy (CE) is an emergent concept to rethink and redesign how our economy works. The concept recognizes effective and efficient economic functioning at multiple scalesgovernments and individuals, globally and locally; for businesses, large and small. CE represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience at multiple levels (macro, meso and micro); generating new business and economic opportunities while providing environmental and societal benefits. Blockchain, an emergent and critical technology, is introduced to the circular economy environment as a potential enabler for many circular economic principles. Blockchain technology supported information systems can improve circular economy performance at multiple levels. Product deletion, a neglected but critical effort in product management and product portfolio management, is utilized as an illustrative business scenario as to blockchain's application in a circular economy research context. Product deletion, unlike product proliferation, has received minimal attention from both academics and practitioners. Product deletion decisions need to be evaluated and analyzed in the circular economy context. CE helps address risk aversion issues in product deletions such as inventory, waste and information management. This paper is the first to conceptualize the relationships amongst blockchain technology, product deletion and the circular economy. Many nuances of relationships are introduced in this study. Future evaluation and critical reflections are also presented with a need for a rigorous and robust research agenda to evaluate the multiple and complex relationships and interplay amongst technology, policy, commerce and the natural environment.

AB With the rapid growth of renewable energy resources, energy trading has been shifting from the centralized manner to distributed manner. Blockchain, as a distributed public ledger technology, has been widely adopted in the design of new energy trading schemes. However, there are many challenging issues in blockchain-based energy trading, e.g., low efficiency, high transaction cost, and security and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, many solutions have been proposed. In this survey, the blockchain-based energy trading in the electrical power system is thoroughly investigated. Firstly, the challenges in blockchain-based energy trading are identified and summarized. Then, the existing energy trading schemes are studied and classified into three categories based on their main focuses: energy transaction, consensus mechanism, and system optimization. Blockchain-based energy trading has been a popular research topic, new blockchain architectures, models and products are continually emerging to overcome the limitations of existing solutions, forming a virtuous circle. The internal combination of different blockchain types and the combination of blockchain with other technologies improve the blockchain-based energy trading system to better satisfy the practical requirements of modern power systems. However, there are still some problems to be solved, for example, the lack of regulatory system, environmental challenges and so on. In the future, we will strive for a better optimized structure and establish a comprehensive security assessment model for blockchain-based energy trading system.

AB Capable of aggregating multiple energy resources, the energy service company (ESCO) has been regarded as a promising alternative for improving power system flexibility and facilitate the consumption of renewable resources in the energy market. However, the issues have become significantly more serious related to the privacy and security of the data in consumption and trading. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a privacy-preserving energy scheduling (PPES) model based on energy blockchain network. A Lagrangian relaxation method is applied to decompose the model into several individual optimal scheduling problems, and the individual scheduling problems are solved by consensus algorithm and smart contracts in energy blockchain network. The performance of the proposed model and method is evaluated with several case studies based on multiple energy nodes. Simulation results show the rationality and validity of the proposed method, and the model is conducive to the protection of environment and transparent scheduling of energy service companies (ESCOs). In addition, it can reflect the information of energy demand and supply to improve the privacy and security of data.

AB The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.

AB Future Sustainability Computing (FSC) is an emerging concept that holds various types of paradigms, rules, procedures, and policies to support breadth and length of the deployment of Information Technology (IT) for abundant life. However, advanced IT-based FCS is facing several sustainability problems in different information processing and computing environments. Solutions to these problems can call upon various computational and algorithmic frameworks that employ optimization, integration, generation, and utilization technique within cloud, mobile, and cluster computing, such as meta-heuristics, decision support systems, prediction and control, dynamical systems, machine learning, and so on. Therefore, this special issue deals with various software and hardware design, novel architectures and frameworks, specific mathematical models, and efficient modeling-simulation for advance IT-based FCS. We accepted eighteen articles in the six different IT dimensions: machine learning, blockchain, optimized resource provision, communication network, IT governance, and information security. All accepted articles contribute to the applications and research in the FCS, such as software and information processing, cloud storage organization, smart devices, efficient algorithmic information processing and distribution.

AB Despite key advances in healthcare informatics and management, little progress to address supply chain process-related problems has been made to date. Specifically, key healthcare supply chain processes include product recalls, monitoring of product supply shortages, expiration, and counterfeits. Implementing and executing these processes in a trusted, secure, efficient, globally accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and impact health outcomes adversely. Blockchain, combined with the Internet of things (IoT), is an emerging technology that can offer a practical solution to these challenges. Accordingly, IoT blockchain offers a superior way to track and trace products via a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger of the blockchain network. This article highlights key challenges related to healthcare supply chains, and illustrates how IoT blockchain technologies can play a role in overcoming these challenges now and in the near future.

AB Blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) is transforming the existing operational models of economy, financial transactions and other government machineries so as to allow these to operate in a much more secure and decentralized manner. This research focuses on providing framework for decentralized and secure P2P infrastructure for handling e-stamp and property registration mechanism along with interface for verification of document originality. The proposed efficient consensus mechanism reduces the overhead of broadcasting a new block by more than 50% coupled with saving CPU computation power along with network bandwidth. To ensure that even people at remote locations with constrained resources are able to participate and harness these benefits, a cloud server architecture & web interface for verification of property registered deed is also proposed.

AB "Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly." - Vitalik Buterin, co-founder Ethereum and Bitcoin Magazine
   Blockchain has evolved to be the most discussed and potentially disruptive technology and is expected to become a driving force for technology-based business innovations. Although blockchain is still in infancy in terms of technological maturity, experimental adoption and customization are already in progress. One of its' early adopters, Supply chain Management is expecting to find fascinating solutions for its most pressing issues like confidentiality and trust, along with those of the inability to share information between supply chain partners, limitations of IT systems and lack of data standards. This paper is an attempt to seek the applicability of blockchain technology in the business process of Supply Chain Management. The Paper provides a comprehensive map for technical feasibility of a blockchain based supply chain through the distributed concepts including proof of work, consensus, and smart contracts.

TI Blockchain-Based Decentralized Trust Management in Vehicular Networks

DT Article
DE Blockchain; data credibility; trust management; vehicular networks
AB Vehicular networks enable vehicles to generate and broadcast messages in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to the nontrusted environments, it is difficult for vehicles to evaluate the credibilities of received messages. In this paper, we propose a decentralized trust management system in vehicular networks based on blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles can validate the received messages from neighboring vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the validation result, the vehicle will generate a rating for each message source vehicle. With the ratings uploaded from vehicles, roadside units (RSUs) calculate the trust value offsets of involved vehicles and pack these data into a "block." Then, each RSU will try to add their "blocks" to the trust blockchain which is maintained by all the RSUs. By employing the joint proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the more total value of offsets (stake) is in the block, the easier RSU can find the nonce for the hash function (PoW). In this way, all RSUs collaboratively maintain an updated, reliable, and consistent trust blockchain. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is effective and feasible in collecting, calculating, and storing trust values in vehicular networks.

AB Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control (AC) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized AC system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control (BlendCAC), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proofof- concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i. e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i. e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained AC solution for space system toward SSA.

   The work facilitates a collaborative medical decision-making scheme among patients, doctors and insurance companies through a blockchain-based architecture.
   Abstract The current healthcare sector is facing difficulty in satisfying the growing issues, expenses, and heavy regulation of quality treatment. Surely, electronic medical records (EMRs) and protected health information (PHI) are highly sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII). However, the sharing of EMRs, enhances overall treatment quality. A distributed ledger (blockchain) technology, embedded with privacy and security by architecture, provides a transparent application developing platform. Privacy, security, and lack of confidence among stakeholders are the main downsides of extensive medical collaboration. This study, therefore, utilizes the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology to establish a collaborative medical decision-making scheme. This study considers the experience, skill, and collaborative success rate of four key stakeholders (patient, cured patient, doctor, and insurance company) in the healthcare domain to propose a local reference-based consortium blockchain scheme, and an associated consensus gathering algorithm, proof-of-familiarity (PoF). Stakeholders create a transparent and tenable medical decision to increase the interoperability among collaborators through PoF. A prototype of PoF is tested with multichain 2.0, a blockchain implementing framework. Moreover, the privacy of identities, EMRs, and decisions are preserved by two-layer storage, encryption, and a timestamp storing mechanism. Finally, superiority over existing schemes is identified to improve personal data (PII) privacy and patient-centric outcomes research (PCOR).

AB The implementation of IP technology in wireless sensor networks has promoted the development of many smart scenarios. To enhance secure access in IP-enabled wireless sensor networks, access control to sensor nodes is a necessary process. However, access control currently faces two challenges, feasibility and preservation of user access privacy. In this paper, we propose eHAPAC, a novel privacy-preserving access control model for IP-enabled wireless sensor networks. The contributions of our paper include three parts. First, this paper integrates the Hidra access control protocol and APAC privacy-preserving model, addressing the issue of privacy-preserving access control in resource-constrained devices. Second, this paper proposes an enhanced Hidra protocol to implement the unlinkability of protocol message exchanges. Third, to solve the problem of third party credibility, this paper improves the group signature-based APAC model and utilizes blockchain technology to manage the storage and publication of public group signature keys. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our protocol is secure and effective.

   sharing
AB Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it's hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem.

AB As fifth-generation mobile communication systems give rise to new smart grid technologies, such as distributed energy resources, advanced communication systems, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, the development of novel platforms and business models that ensure reliability and profitability of microgrid operations become increasingly important. In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services.

AB Traditional voting and bidding systems largely rely on paperwork and human resources throughout the voting process, which can incur high costs in terms of both time and money. Electronic voting and electronic bidding systems can be used to reduce costs, and many new systems have been introduced. However, most systems require a powerful and trusted third party to guarantee system integrity and security. With developments in blockchain technology, research has begun to highlight the core concept of decentralization. In this study, we introduce the first decentralized electronic voting and bidding systems based on a blockchain and smart contract. We also use cryptographic techniques such as oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryptions to improve privacy protection. Our proposed systems allow voters and bidders to participate in the opening phase and improve participant anonymity, the privacy of data transmission, and data reliability and verifiability. Moreover, compared with other electronic voting and bidding systems, our systems are safer and more efficient.

TI Digitalization and Corporate Law - A View from Germany
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Digitalization revolutionizes all legal areas, including corporate law. The article deals with different impacts of digitalization on communication schemes in corporations, such as virtual general assemblies or communication patterns in board of directors, also encompassing communication with third parties, namely investors. The legal framework for these communication patterns refer not only to corporate but also to media regulations, data protections, as well as capital market law. Digitalization also has an impact on liability of directors: As Big Data and new algorithms improve the information base for decision making of directors they are at the same time obliged to make use of it. On the other hand, IT-security has become one of the main tasks for directors as digitalization of all work flows in enterprises requires necessary IT-security standards in order to avoid existential risks in case of attacks. Furthermore, Blockchain as a new technology enables the secure identification of all kind of transactions, including automatized contracts (so-called smart contracts) which could enhance procedures in corporations. New problems arise concerning the use of Blockchain as an investment form such as DAO Ethereum. Finally, the phenomenon of close cooperation between different partners by using digital work flows and semi-intelligent agents (so-called industry 4.0) is discussed.

TI Smart Contract-Based Access Control for the Internet of Things

AB This paper investigates a critical access control issue in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, we propose a smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC), and one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update, and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC, and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices have brought much efficiency and convenience to our daily life. However, the devices may collect a myriad of data from people without their consent. Controlling the large amount of data generated from the devices from being misused is critical to mitigate privacy risks. Therefore, privacy protection on personal data has become an important factor in the development of the IoT. Historically, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) can effectively enhance the privacy and protect users' personally identifiable information. To date, many researchers have stressed the importance of PETs and proposed solutions relevant to different application fields of the IoT. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the research has analyzed the PETs in IoT from the aspects of privacy threat issues and privacy legislation. As a result, this paper surveys on the solutions of PETs in the field of IoT, which has filtered down from the large number of published academic papers to the 120 primary studies published between 2014 and 2017. After collecting the papers, we categorized them based on the functions and the coverage of privacy protection, and analyzed them from different aspects, ranging from high-level principles of general data protection regulations and ISO/IEC 29100:2011 requirements to the actual resolution of privacy threats in IoT. Thus, we aim to identify the current state of development of the PETs in various fields and examine whether the existing PETs comply with the latest legal principles and privacy standards and reduce the threats to privacy. Finally, recommendations for future research are given based on the results.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing blockchain protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We start by describing the blockchains and summarizing the existing surveys that deal with blockchain technologies. Then, we provide an overview of the application domains of blockchain technologies in IoT, e.g., Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Energy, Internet of Cloud, Edge computing, etc. Moreover, we provide a classification of threat models, which are considered by blockchain protocols in IoT networks, into five main categories, namely identity-based attacks, manipulation-based attacks, cryptanalytic attacks, reputation-based attacks, and service-based attacks. In addition, we provide a taxonomy and a side-by-side comparison of the state-of-the-art methods toward secure and privacy-preserving blockchain technologies with respect to the blockchain model, specific security goals, performance, limitations, computation complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the current survey, we highlight open research challenges and discuss possible future research directions in the blockchain technologies for IoT.

TI Distributed Consensus Algorithm for Events Detection in Cyber-Physical

ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; INTERNET
AB In the harsh environmental conditions of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the consensus problem seems to be one of the central topics that affect the performance of consensus-based applications, such as events detection, estimation, tracking, blockchain, etc. In this paper, we investigate the events detection based on consensus problem of CPS by means of compressed sensing (CS) for applications such as attack detection, industrial process monitoring, automatic alert system, and prediction for potentially dangerous events in CPS. The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Delay and Communication Tradeoffs for Blockchain Systems With

AB The emerging blockchain protocols provide a decentralized architecture that is suitable of supporting Internet of Things (IoT) interactions. However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g., state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink from the wireless base station to the IoT device. A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In the conclusion, this paper is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity.

AB In vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, battery-powered vehicle (BV) provides service to the power grid. In order to encourage more BVs to provide the service for power grid, it is necessary to reward the BVs from the power grid. To extensively deploy V2G networks, some security and privacy problems must be solved. In this paper, for the first time, we propose the novel concept of blockchain-based anonymous rewarding scheme (BBARS) for V2G networks. The novel concept comes from the application requirement which has not been solved by now. We give the formal system model and security model of BBARS. Then, we design the concrete BBARS scheme by making use of two different public key cryptosystem. Through security analysis and performance analysis, the designed scheme is provably secure and efficient. The analysis results also show the designed BBARS scheme is practical for secure V2G networks in smart grid.

ID KEY MANAGEMENT; SCHEME
AB As modern vehicles and distributed fog services advance apace, vehicular fog services (VFSs) are being expected to span across multiple geo-distributed datacenters, which inevitably leads to cross-datacenter authentication. Traditional cross-datacenter authentication models are not suitable for the scenario of high-speed moving vehicles accessing VFS, because these models either ignored user privacy or ignored the delay requirement of driving vehicles. This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted lightweight anonymous authentication (BLA) mechanism for distributed VFS, which is provisioned to driving vehicles. BLA can achieve the following advantages: 1) realizing a flexible cross-datacenter authentication, in which a vehicle can decide whether to be reauthenticated or not when it enters a new vehicular fog datacenter; 2) achieving anonymity, and granting vehicle users the responsibility of preserving their privacy; 3) it is lightweight by achieving noninteractivity between vehicles and service managers (SMs), and eliminating the communication between SMs in the authentication process, which significantly reduces the communication delay; and 4) resisting the attack that the database governed by one center is tampered with. BLA achieves these advantages by effectively combining modern cryptographical technology and blockchain technology. These security features are demonstrated by carrying out security analysis. Meanwhile, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency and practicality of BLA.

AB In emerging economies, with the explosion of e-commerce, payment methods have increasingly enhanced security. However, Cash-on-Delivery (COD) payment method still prevails in cash-based economies. Although COD allows consumers to be more proactive in making payments, it still appears to be vulnerable by the appearance of a third party (shipping companies). In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on "smart contract" implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract. We also provided a detailed implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our model.

AB An individual's health data is very sensitive and private. Such data are usually stored on a private or community owned cloud, where access is not restricted to the owners of that cloud. Anyone within the cloud can access this data. This data may not be read only and multiple parties can make to it. Thus, any unauthorized modification of health-related data will lead to incorrect diagnosis and mistreatment. However, we cannot restrict semipublic access to this data. Existing security mechanisms in e-health systems are competent in dealing with the issues associated with these systems but only up to a certain extent. The indigenous technologies need to be complemented with current and future technologies. We have put forward a method to complement such technologies by incorporating the concept of blockchain to ensure the integrity of data as well as its provenance.

AB Based on the influence of block chain technology on information sharing among supply chain participants, mean-CVaR (conditional value at risk) is used to characterize retailers' risk aversion behavior, while a Stackelberg game is taken to study the optimal decision-making of manufacturers and retailers during decentralized and centralized decision-making processes. Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer's order quantity is low, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer's order quantity is high, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved. Finally, the specific numerical simulation is adopted to analyze the weighted proportion, risk aversion and the impact of blockchain technology on the supply chain, and verify the relevant conclusions.

ID INTERMEDIARIES
AB Construction customers want more complex facilities delivered faster and at a lower cost. Transaction costs account for a significant proportion of each new or refurbished facility (a 2017 report from the Infrastructure Client Group in the UK suggests as high as 50%), yet they contribute no value to the customer. Blockchain is being suggested as a way to reduce transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries to build trust as a prerequisite for successfully executed agreements. This study first describes the thinking that underpins blockchain technology, outlining how it works, and the potential limitations of the technology. Second, using a case study, reviews the potential cost savings from the use of blockchain for a real estate company. The results reveal a potential cost savings from blockchain deployment at 8.3% of the total cost of residential construction, with a standard deviation of 1.26%. Third, we explore the implications, risks and applications of blockchain technology for improving flow in the end-to-end design and construction process and we identify opportunities for future research on blockchain applications in construction.

AB Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used in the modeling, design and prediction in energy systems. During the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the advancement and application of various types of ML models for energy systems. This paper presents the state of the art of ML models used in energy systems along with a novel taxonomy of models and applications. Through a novel methodology, ML models are identified and further classified according to the ML modeling technique, energy type, and application area. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature leads to an assessment and performance evaluation of the ML models and their applications, and a discussion of the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research. This paper further concludes that there is an outstanding rise in the accuracy, robustness, precision and generalization ability of the ML models in energy systems using hybrid ML models. Hybridization is reported to be effective in the advancement of prediction models, particularly for renewable energy systems, e.g., solar energy, wind energy, and biofuels. Moreover, the energy demand prediction using hybrid models of ML have highly contributed to the energy efficiency and therefore energy governance and sustainability.

TI Microgrid Group Trading Model and Solving Algorithm Based on Blockchain

AB With the development of the energy Internet and the integration of multi-type energy situations, it is of great significance to study the competition game of a multi-agent microgrid group system for its development. As an emerging distributed database technology, blockchain technology has great application potential in the field of energy trading. Firstly, blockchain technology is coupled with the microgrid group transaction, and the information flow transaction model of a microgrid group based on blockchain technology is established. Aiming at this complex multi-objective optimization problem, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Finally, the competitive trading model and solving algorithm are simulated and analyzed. The relevant results show that the near global optimum price strategy of each time based on the proposed model can effectively balance the efficiency of each subject in the market. In addition, the model ensures that there is no high-income and low-cost phenomenon in the trading process, therefore the security and quality of the market are guaranteed.

TI Bitcoin and the GDPR: Allocating responsibility in distributed networks

ID GENERAL-DATA-PROTECTION
AB This article uses the example of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to show how distributed networks challenge existing legal mechanisms of allocating responsibility. The Bitcoin network stores personal data by automated means. Furthermore, full nodes qualify as establishments and the network offers a service to citizens in the EU. The data processing within the Bitcoin network therefore falls into the material and territorial scope of the GDPR. To protect data subjects, the GDPR allocates responsibility to the controller, who determines the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. However, the distributed structure of the Bitcoin network blurs the lines between actors who are responsible and actors who are worth protecting. Neither the Bitcoin users running lightweight nodes or full nodes nor the miners determine the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. They carry out their network activities according to the Bitcoin protocol, which can only be adopted and enforced by a collective of full nodes and miners. Members of this collective are joint controllers under Article 26 GDPR, which obliges them to clearly and transparently determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR. However, this mechanism fails because of the very structure it aims to eliminate. Therefore, a solution to allocating responsibility for data protection in distributed networks lies outside the GDPR.

DE micropayment; blockchain; bitcoin
AB Cryptocurrencies based on blockchain infrastructures have shown their advantages such as double-spending resistance and decentralization. Each transaction of cryptocurrency requires a certain amount of computation and attracts transaction fees. Often, in practice, many transactions are small; therefore, they add computation and transmission overheads to the system. In this paper, we introduce a cost-saving approach, which significantly reduces transaction time and storage for small amount of payment, i.e. micropayment. In our approach, with the notion of transaction commitment', the computation of each transaction is much more efficient. Therefore, our approach has advantages in comparison of other cryptocurrency systems such as the bitcoin system. Our approach can be applied to other existing cryptocurrency systems.

AB The medical device industry is undergoing rapid change as innovation accelerates, new business models emerge, and artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things create disruptive possibilities in health care. On the innovation front, global annual patent applications related to medical devices have tripled in 10 years, and technology cycle times have halved in just 5 years. Connectivity has exploded-by 2021, the world will have more than three times as many smart connected devices as people-and more and more medical devices and processes contain integrated sensors. In this article, we report on recent McKinsey (McKinsey & Company, New York, New York) work to map start-ups and trends shaping the future of medical imaging. We identify technology clusters with prospects of future growth, look at some of their cutting-edge practices, and consider what the implications may be for our specialty.

AB Genome editing therapies hold great promise for the cure of monogenic and other diseases; however, the application of nonviral gene delivery methods is limited by both a lack of fundamental knowledge of interactions of the gene-carrier in complex animals and biocompatibility. Herein, we characterize nonviral gene delivery vehicle formulations that are based on diblock polycations containing a hydrophilic and neutral glucose block chain extended with cationic secondary amines of three lengths, poly(methacrylamido glucopyranose-block-2-methylaminoethyl methacrylate) [P(MAG-b-MAEMt)-1, -2, -3]. These polymers were formulated with plasmid DNA to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes (polyplexes). In addition, two controls, P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt), were synthesized, formulated into polyplexes and the ex vivo hemocompatibility, or blood compatibility, and in vivo biodistribution of the formulations were compared to the glycopolymers. While both polymer structure and N/P (amine to phosphate) ratio were important factors affecting hemocompatibility, N/P ratio played a stronger role in determining polyplex biodistribution. P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt) lysed red blood cells at both high and low N/P formulations while P(MAG-b-MAEMt) did not significantly lyse cells at either formulation at short and medium polymer lengths. Conversely, P(MAG-b-MAEMt) did not affect coagulation at N/P = 5, but significantly delayed coagulation at N/P = 15. P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt) did not affect coagulation at either formulation. After polymer and pDNA cargo distribution was observed in vivo, P(EG-b-MAEMt) N/P = 5 and P(MAG-b-MAEMt) N/P = S both dissociated and deposited polymer in the liver, while pDNA cargo from P(MAG-b-MAEMt) N/P = 15 was found in the liver, lungs, and spleen. The contrast between P(MAG-bMAEMt) at N/P = 5 and 15 demonstrates that polyplex stability in the blood can be improved with N/P ratio and potentially aid polyplex biodistribution through simply varying the formulation ratios.

AB Litecoin is a peer to peer internet crypto digital currency protocol held electronically that gains fame in the recent days. It is transferred electronically with a very low transaction fees without the help of any financial organizations. In this paper, online transaction from one person to another is studied in peer to peer networks with reduced transaction time. Here, a block chain distribution in bit-torrent network is considered to transact the litecoins. This method aims at gathering information on network size, number of client and network distributions. In this minimal structure network, broadcasted messages and nodes can rejoin or leave the network based on best effort basis. Finally, efforts are considered to avoid double spending attacks on litecoins.

AB Based on blockchain and quantum signature, a novel E-payment protocol is proposed in this paper. Our E-payment protocol could protect user's anonymity as the traditional E-payment systems do, and also have unconditional security which the classical E-payment systems can not provide. Our scheme adopt the techniques of blockchain, quantum key distribution, one-time pad and quantum proxy blind signature. Furthermore, compared with the existing quantum E-payment systems, the blockchain technology is introduced to make our scheme more secure.

TI Transformations, transitions, or tall tales? A global review of the
   uptake and impact of NoSQL, blockchain, and big data analytics on the
   land administration sector
SO LAND USE POLICY

AB Unstructured data, non-relational databases, distributed databases, and big data analytics potentially change the landscape for digital land data creation, use, management, and dissemination. The way land data is governed and the resultant impact on land tenure security delivery is open to substantial re-thinking. Drawing from international cases, this paper provides a state-of-the-art examination of prototypes and demonstrators from the global land sector. The aim is to deliver an insight into the opportunities, challenges, impacts, and future scenarios regarding the application of the emerging technologies. The paper finds that whilst uptake of non-relational and distributed databases is occurring, it remains largely at the level of proof-of-concept, demonstrator or pilot. Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated. Whether these observed embryonic developments lead to sector transformation or orderly transition, is seen to be heavily reliant on the prevailing political, socio-cultural and institutional settings within a jurisdiction.

TI Blockchain based secure data sharing system for Internet of vehicles: A

AB One of the benefits of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is improved traffic safety and efficiency, for example due to the capability to share vehicular messages in real-time. While most of the vehicular messages only need to be shared by nearby vehicles, some messages (e.g., announcement messages) may need to be more broadly distributed, for example to vehicles in a wider region. Finding a single trusted entity to store and distribute such messages can be challenging, and vehicles may not be inclined to participate (e.g., generation and distribution of announcement messages) unless they can benefit from such participation. In addition, achieving both security and privacy can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure data sharing system to address the above challenges in an IoV setting. Specifically, in our system, announcement messages are stored using blockchain. To encourage/incentivize participation, vehicles that faithfully broadcast the announcement messages and/or contribute to the block generation will be rewarded by some cryptocurrency. Our system is also designed to be privacy-preserving and realizes both priori and posteriori countermeasures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI MicroBTC: Efficient, Flexible and Fair Micropayment for Bitcoin Using

AB While Bitcoin gains increasing popularity in different payment scenarios, the transaction fees make it difficult to be applied to micropayment. Given the wide applicability of micropayment, it is crucial for all cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to provide effective support therein. In light of this, a number of low-cost micropayment schemes for Bitcoin have been proposed recently to reduce micropayment costs. Existing schemes, however, suffer from drawbacks such as high computation cost, inflexible payment value, and possibly unfair exchanges. The paper proposes two new micropayment schemes, namely the basic MicroBTC and the advanced MicroBTC, for Bitcoin by integrating the hash chain technique into cryptocurrency transactions. The basic MicroBTC realizes micropayment by exposing hash pre-images on the hash chain one by one, and it can also make arbitrary micropayments by exposing multiple hash pre-images. We further design the advanced MicroBTC to achieve non-interactive refund and efficient hash chain verification. We analyze the complexity and security of the both MicroBTC schemes and implement them using the Bitcoin source code. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate their performance, and the result showed that a micropayment session can be processed within about 18ms for the basic MicroBTC and 9ms for the advanced MicroBTC on a laptop. Both schemes enjoy great efficiency in computation and flexibility in micropayments, and they also achieve fairness for both the payer and the payee.

AB New network technologies are framed as eliminating transaction costs', a notion first developed in economic theory that now drives the design of market systems. However, the actual promise of the elimination of transaction costs seems unfeasible, because of a cyclical pattern in which network technologies that make that promise create processes of institutionalization that create new forms transaction costs. Nonetheless, the promises legitimize the exemption of innovations of network technologies from critical scrutiny.

AB Conventional food trading platforms face several issues, such as quickly to find trading objects and protect the reliability of transaction information. With e-commerce developing rapidly, food trading has also recently shifted to the online domain. Blockchain has changed many industries owing to its robustness, decentralization and end-to-end credibility. This paper proposes a novel Food Trading System with COnsortium blockchaiN (FTSCON) to improve trust and security issues in transactions. It uses consortium blockchain technology to set permission and authentication for different roles in food transaction, which meet the challenge of the privacy protection of multi-stakeholders. The algorithm of optimized transaction combination is designed for the purpose of helping users find suitable transaction objects. It can choose the optimized trading portfolio for buyers. The online double auction mechanism is used to eliminate competition. And the improved PBFT (iPBFT) is used to enhance efficiency of system. Moreover, a smart-contract life- cycle management method is introduced, and security analysis shows that FTSCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Experiment results based on a series of data indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve profit improvement of merchants.

AB To date, there is a considerable lack of transparency in the sales of digital assets between the author and providers of the digital assets, which typically leads to denying the authors from receiving their fair share of royalty. This paper proposes a blockchain-based framework and solution for online publishing and sale of digital assets. The solution is based on utilizing smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain to govern the sales of e-books and ensure that the payment is dispersed in cryptocurrency as agreed among the publisher(s) and the author. Our solution handles cases related to incentives for both publishers and customers to ensure integral delivery of the digital books, failure of downloads, and refunds. We provide the full code of the Ethereum smart contract, and we also performed security vulnerability analysis to ascertain that our smart contract is bug free and secure against known attacks and vulnerabilities.

TI Paris is not enough: Toward an Information Technology (IT) enabled

DT Article
DE Transnational; Carbon surcharge; Climate insurance; Social media;
   Blockchain
AB The 2015 Paris Agreement was undoubtedly an important diplomatic achievement. Organizations and experts have rallied around it, all the more since the attack against the agreement by the current US administration. This rally has led to a collective unwillingness to acknowledge what the evidence already tells us: the Paris Agreement and the currently dominant, international approach to climate change policy will not work. Much faster and more decisive change is needed; a paradigm shift. We need a policy which provides for a realistic yet rapid transition from our dependence on cheap fossil fuels to deep decarbonization and a sustained reliance on renewable sources of energy. We argue in this paper that, thanks to advances in Information Technology (IT) and social media, viable options exist for an alternative global, transnational climate policy. Three key principles have to be followed: (i) gradual expansion across boundaries; (ii) use of economic incentives to compel behavioral change; and (iii) a close link between the price of carbon and the use of raised funds. The funds from the climate risk surcharge collected on fossil fuels at the source, a central piece of the proposal, are to be used for subsidizing adaption to and insurance against damage from climate change. The paper argues that the challenges in terms of information requirements and institutional resistance can be overcome if IT solutions are deployed within a public-private governance framework that protects the public interest.

AB After now nearly 10 years of existence, in recent years cryptocurrencies have undergone a remarkable development. Awareness and market capitalization as well as trading volume have greatly increased in a long-term comparison but recently since the beginning of 2018 they have dropped massively in value. The question must be asked: are cryptocurrencies the future or only a fad, a hype? The blockchain, a technology that found its first main application in cryptocurrencies, will be applied in the future far beyond this field and possible accelerate the way to a cash-free future. The worldwide transfer of money could also be accelerated because a transaction with cryptocurrencies on the other side of the world can reach the recipient after only a few minutes. This obviously happens faster or slower depending on the cryptocurrency. The different currencies generate their own technologies and procedures, which are designed to increase the safety, stability and velocity. Whether banks and governments will also utilize the world of digital currencies in the future, remains to be seen.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can support surveillance even in areas without network infrastructure. However, UAV networks raise security challenges because of its dynamic topology. This paper proposes a technique for maintaining security in UAV networks in the context of surveillance, by corroborating information about events from different sources. In this way, UAV networks can conform peer-to-peer information inspired by the principles of blockchain, and detect compromised UAVs based on trust policies. The proposed technique uses a secure asymmetric encryption with a pre-shared list of official UAVs. Using this technique, the wrong information can be detected when an official UAV is physically hijacked. The novel agent based simulator ABS-SecurityUAV is used to validate the proposed approach. In our experiments, around 90% of UAVs were able to corroborate information about a person walking in a controlled area, while none of the UAVs corroborated fake information coming from a hijacked UAV.

AB The emergence of edge computing has witnessed a fast-growing volume of data on edge devices belonging to different stakeholders which, however, cannot be shared among them due to the lack of the trust. By exploiting blockchain's non-repudiation and non-tampering properties that enable trust, we develop a blockchain-based big data sharing framework to support various applications across resource-limited edges. In particular, we devise a number of novel resource-efficient techniques for the framework: (1) the PoC (Proof-of-Collaboration) based consensus mechanism with low computation complexity which is especially beneficial to the edge devices with low computation capacity, (2) the blockchain transaction filtering and offloading scheme that can significantly reduce the storage overhead, and (3) new types of blockchain transaction (i.e., Express Transaction) and block (i.e., Hollow Block) to enhance the communication efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal.

AB The accelerating investment in artificial intelligence has vast implications for economic and cognitive development globally. However, AI is currently dominated by an oligopoly of centralized mega-corporations, who focus on the interests of their stakeholders. There is a now universal need for AI services by businesses who lack access to capital to develop their own Al services, and independent Al developers lack visibility and a source of revenue. This uneven playing field has a high potential to lead to inequitable circumstances with negative implications for humanity. Furthermore, the potential of Al is hindered by the lack of interoperability standards. The authors herein propose an alternative path for the development of AI: a distributed, decentralized, and democratized market for AIs run on distributed ledger technology. We describe the features and ethical advantages of such a system using SingularityNET, a watershed project being developed by Ben Goertzel and colleagues, as a case study. We argue that decentralizing Al opens the doors for a more equitable development of AI and AGI. It will also create the infrastructure for coordinated action between AIs that will significantly facilitate the evolution of AI into true AGI that is both highly capable and beneficial for humanity and beyond.

AB We propose a construction of the modulus of the RSA public keys for decentralized public-key trust generation like Web-of-Trust, where the modulus has inside structure. The first function of the structure is that it enables a peer to verify that the owner of the public key certainly generated the corresponding secret key. The second function is to tie up the public key with the owner's identity as well as her guarantors identities. Our construction is based on the modified version of the Lenstra's algorithm, by which a related second public key and the identity strings are embedded into the RSA modulus. The second public key is of the elliptic-curve cryptosystem (ECC) which has almost equivalent security level to the RSA cryptosystem. Our construction is applicable to a peer-to-peer network equipped with the blockchain of "consortium" and "trusted" type to yield a flat network that does not depends on PKI of the X.509 type.

AB Ever-increasing transaction costs, serious network congestion, and low transaction rates in the current blockchain systems restrict their extensive use. To relieve from this situation, we present a secure versatile light payment (SVLP) scheme. The SVLP merely employs a digital signature algorithm and a one-way function and has similar security comparing to existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed scheme is of ultra-low power consumption, since the payers and payees only need one-way functions to achieve multiple transactions, instead of the costly digital signature algorithms. Furthermore, the processes of payment and refunding are flexible. This is due to the fact that the denomination in our scheme possesses divisibility and the users need not to verify the preimages on the long chain one-byone. Finally, as the transaction can be taken off-chain and offline, it can be even used in remote areas or geological disasters areas where communication infrastructures are lacked or destroyed. All these features indicate that our scheme is practical and versatile. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the era of big data, the produced and collected data explode due to the emerging technologies and applications that pervade everywhere in our daily lives, including internet of things applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grid, e-commerce applications and social network. Big data market can carry out efficient data trading, which provides a way to share data and further enhances the utility of data. However, to realize effective data trading in big data market, several challenges need to be resolved. The first one is to verify the data availability for a data consumer. The second is privacy of a data provider who is unwilling to reveal his real identity to the data consumer. The third is the payment fairness between a data provider and a data consumer with atomic exchange. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new blockchain-based fair data trading protocol in big data market. The proposed protocol integrates ring signature, double authentication-preventing signature and similarity learning to guarantee the availability of trading data, privacy of data providers and fairness between data providers and data consumers. We show the proposed protocol achieves the desirable security properties that a secure data trading protocol should have. The implementation results with Solidity smart contract demonstrate the validity of the proposed blockchain-based fair data trading protocol. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Blockchain is a shared distributed digital ledger technology that can better facilitate data management, provenance and security, and has the potential to transform healthcare. Importantly, blockchain represents a data architecture, whose application goes far beyond Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain and has popularized the technology. In the health sector, blockchain is being aggressively explored by various stakeholders to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient outcomes, enhance compliance, and enable better use of healthcare-related data. However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as revolutionary' and disruptive', is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is fit-for-purpose' is pivotal. This concept forms the basis for this article, where we share views from a multidisciplinary group of practitioners at the forefront of blockchain conceptualization, development, and deployment.

AB With the development of the vehicular ad hoc network, the security and privacy are now becoming vital concerns, especially when the attacker owns more and more resources. In order to address these concerns, a dynamic anonymous identity authentication scheme is proposed using Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem and blockchain method, which guarantees the security and fast off-line authentication for vehicle-to-infrastructure. Specifically, a dynamic pseudonym key is generated using tamper proof device (TPD) for off-line authentication and anonymity when a vehicle roams among different roadside units' (RSUs) communication ranges. Even if all RSUs are compromised, vehicle's identity is still privacy. Moreover, two additional design goals are more suitable for the practical environment: (1) the reduced assumption of TPD; (2) certification authority can trace vehicle under the authorization by law.

AB (1) Background: Large eHealth systems should have a mechanism to detect unauthorized changes in patients' medical documentation, access permissions, and logs. This is due to the fact that modern eHealth systems are connected with many healthcare providers and sites. (2) Methods: Design-science methodology was used to create an integrity-protection service model based on blockchain technology. Based on the problem of transactional transparency, requirements were specified and a model was designed. After that, the model's security and performance were evaluated. (3) Results: a blockchain-based eHealth integrity model for ensuring information integrity in eHealth systems that uses a permissioned blockchain with off-chain information storage was created. In contrast to existing solutions, the proposed model allows information removal, which in many countries' eHealth systems is a legal requirement, and is based on a blockchain using the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm. (4) Conclusion: A blockchain can be used to store medical data or only security-related data. In the proposed model, a blockchain is mainly used to implement a data-integrity service. This service can be implemented using other mechanisms, but a blockchain provides a solution that does not require trusted third parties, works in a distributed eHealth environment, and supports document removal.

AB Healthcare information exchange is an important research topic, which can benefit both healthcare providers and patients. In healthcare data sharing, many cloud-based solutions have been proposed, but the trustworthiness of a third-party cloud service is questionable. Recently, blockchain has been introduced in healthcare record sharing, which does not rely on trusting a third party. However, existing approaches only focus on the records collected from medical examination. They are not efficient in sharing data streams continuously generated from sensors and other monitoring devices. Today, IoT devices have been widely deployed and sensors and mobile applications can monitor patients' body conditions. The collected data are shared to laboratories and institutions for diagnosis and further study. Moreover, existing approaches are too rigid to efficiently support metadata change. In this paper, an efficient data-sharing scheme is proposed, called MedChain, which combines blockchain, digest chain, and structured P2P network techniques to overcome the above efficiency issues in the existing approaches for sharing both types of healthcare data. Based on MedChain, a session-based healthcare data-sharing scheme is devised, which brings flexibility in data sharing. The evaluation results show that MedChain can achieve higher efficiency and satisfy the security requirements in data sharing.

AB Purpose Smart cities provide fully integrated and networked connectivity between virtual/digital assets and physical building/infrastructure assets to form digital economies. However, industrial espionage, cyber-crime and deplorable politically driven cyber-interventions threaten to disrupt and/or physically damage the critical infrastructure that supports national wealth generation and preserves the health, safety and welfare of the populous. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of cyber-threats confronting critical infrastructure asset management reliant upon a common data environment to augment building information modelling (BIM) implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist, methodological approach to reviewing pertinent literature (that contained elements of positivism) was adopted. The ensuing mixed methods analysis: reports upon case studies of cyber-physical attacks; reveals distinct categories of hackers; identifies and reports upon the various motivations for the perpetrators/actors; and explains the varied reconnaissance techniques adopted.
   Findings The paper concludes with direction for future research work and a recommendation to utilize innovative block chain technology as a potential risk mitigation measure for digital built environment vulnerabilities.
   Originality/value While cyber security and digitization of the built environment have been widely covered within the extant literature in isolation, scant research has hitherto conducted an holistic review of the perceived threats, deterrence applications and future developments in a digitized Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. This review presents concise and lucid reference guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both practitioners and researchers in the AECO field of enquiry.

AB The first commercial transaction with the first cryptocurrency in 2010 marked the start of a revolution in transactions. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success. The research was conducted in Spain with college-educated adults with basic knowledge of the Internet.

TI Blockchain and OECD data repositories: opportunities and policymaking
   implications

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to employ the case of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data repositories to examine the potential of blockchain technology in the context of addressing basic contemporary societal concerns, such as transparency, accountability and trust in the policymaking process. Current approaches to sharing data employ standardized metadata, in which the provider of the service is assumed to be a trusted party. However, derived data, analytic processes or links from policies, are in many cases not shared in the same form, thus breaking the provenance trace and making the repetition of analysis conducted in the past difficult. Similarly, it becomes tricky to test whether certain conditions justifying policies implemented still apply. A higher level of reuse would require a decentralized approach to sharing both data and analytic scripts and software. This could be supported by a combination of blockchain and decentralized file system technology. Design/methodology/approach The findings presented in this paper have been derived from an analysis of a case study, i.e., analytics using data made available by the OECD. The set of data the OECD provides is vast and is used broadly. The argument is structured as follows. First, current issues and topics shaping the debate on blockchain are outlined. Then, a redefinition of the main artifacts on which some simple or convoluted analytic results are based is revised for some concrete purposes. The requirements on provenance, trust and repeatability are discussed with regards to the architecture proposed, and a proof of concept using smart contracts is used for reasoning on relevant scenarios. Findings A combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts can ascertain that the set of artifacts used for the analytics is shared. This enables the sequence underlying the successive stages of research and/or policymaking to be preserved. This suggests that, in turn, and ex post, it becomes possible to test whether evidence supporting certain findings and/or policy decisions still hold. Moreover, unlike traditional databases, blockchain technology makes it possible that immutable records can be stored. This means that the artifacts can be used for further exploitation or repetition of results. In practical terms, the use of blockchain technology creates the opportunity to enhance the evidence-based approach to policy design and policy recommendations that the OECD fosters. That is, it might enable the stakeholders not only to use the data available in the OECD repositories but also to assess corrections to a given policy strategy or modify its scope.
   Research limitations/implications - Blockchains and related technologies are still maturing, and several questions related to their use and potential remain underexplored. Several issues require particular consideration in future research, including anonymity, scalability and stability of the data repository. This research took as example OECD data repositories, precisely to make the point that more research and more dialogue between the research and policymaking community is needed to embrace the challenges and opportunities blockchain technology generates. Several questions that this research prompts have not been addressed. For instance, the question of how the sharing economy concept for the specifics of the case could be employed in the context of blockchain has not been dealt with.
   Practical implications - The practical implications of the research presented here can be summarized in two ways. On the one hand, by suggesting how a combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain, such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts, can ascertain that artifacts are shared, this paper paves the way toward a discussion on how to make this approach and solution reality. The approach and architecture proposed in this paper would provide a way to increase the scope of the reuse of statistical data and results and thus would improve the effectiveness of decision making as well as the transparency of the evidence supporting policy.
   Social implications - Decentralizing analytic artifacts will add to existing open data practices an additional layer of benefits for different actors, including but not limited to policymakers, journalists, analysts and/or researchers without the need to establish centrally managed institutions. Moreover, due to the degree of decentralization and absence of a single-entry point, the vulnerability of data repositories to cyberthreats might be reduced. Simultaneously, by ensuring that artifacts derived from data based in those distributed depositories are made immutable therein, full reproducibility of conclusions concerning the data is possible. In the field of data-driven policymaking processes, it might allow policymakers to devise more accurate ways of addressing pressing issues and challenges.
   Originality/value - This paper offers the first blueprint of a form of sharing that complements open data practices with the decentralized approach of blockchain and decentralized file systems. The case of OECD data repositories is used to highlight that while data storing is important, the real added value of blockchain technology rests in the possible change on how we use the data and data sets in the repositories. It would eventually enable a more transparent and actionable approach to linking policy up with the supporting evidence. From a different angle, throughout the paper the case is made that rather than simply data, artifacts from conducted analyses should be made persistent in a blockchain. What is at stake is the full reproducibility of conclusions based on a given set of data, coupled with the possibility of ex post testing the validity of the assumptions and evidence underlying those conclusions.

AB When an author under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published the paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" in 2008, the first cryptocurrency using the new blockchain technology was introduced. Over the last decade, more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin were developed and Bitcoin's currency had almost reached an equivalent value of 20,000 $/BTC. After recognizing the disrupting momentum that the blockchain technology generated, scientists started to develop blockchain use cases for the energy sector. However, the scientific literature so far offers only rough and incomplete estimations when questions about the current and future energy consumption of the Bitcoin network are raised. This paper introduces a new scenario model to estimate the mining power demand of the Bitcoin and Ethereum network. Six scenarios are developed on the basis of mining hardware efficiency and network parameter data. The results show that an increase of the mining hardware efficiency will only have a limited impact on the overall power demand of blockchain networks. Furthermore, the current power demand of the Ethereum network is in the range from 0.6 to 3 GW and therefore, is similar to the one of Bitcoin. In case of linear growth of the block difficulty and sigmoidal increase of the hardware efficiency until the year of 2025, the mining power demand for the Bitcoin blockchain will be approximately 8 GW. Furthermore, the model and the scenarios are adaptable to other cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-work consensus algorithm to create scenarios for their future power demand.

AB Blockchains are proposed for many application domains apart from financial transactions. While there are generic blockchains that can be molded for specific use cases, they often lack a lightweight and easy-to-customize implementation. In this paper, we introduce the core concepts of blockchain technology and investigate a real-world use case from the energy domain, where customers trade portions of their photovoltaic power plant via a blockchain. This does not only involve blockchain technology, but also requires user interaction. Therefore, a fully custom, private, and permissioned blockchain is implemented from scratch. We evaluate and motivate the need for blockchain technology within this use case, as well as the desired properties of the system. We then describe the implementation and the insights from our implementation in detail, serving as a guide for others and to show potential opportunities and pitfalls when implementing a blockchain from scratch.

ID PRIVACY; RECORDS
AB Purpose This paper aims to explore a paradoxical situation, asking whether it is possible to reconcile the immutable ledger known as blockchain with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and more broadly privacy and data protection. Design/methodology/approach This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR's application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals.
   Research limitations/implications -Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications - Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications - Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces.

AB The widespread computer network has been changing drastically and substantially since blockchain and IoT entered the stage. Blockchain is good at protecting data transactions between logical nodes with a desirable guaranty. Internet of Things (IoT), on the other hand, by providing ultimate convenience to consumers, is expected to give rise to many various merits in a broad business scene. The security of IoT is still an open problem and if blockchain can reinforce IoT security, as many authors have hoped in recent papers, these newcomers appear to make a good collaboration to reinforce IoT security. However, software copes with logical nodes and IoT involves a vast number of physical nodes (IoT devices). Enabling blockchain to protect IoT cannot be brought to reality without respectively identifying logical and physical nodes. This is identical to the Proof-of-Trust problem. In this article, we propose a conceptual solution-Blockchained IoT-and show that this concept is able to be realized on-chip level using mass-produced dynamical random access memory (DRAM). We have completed the first test of longevity and temperature dependence (-40 degrees C to 105 degrees C) to confirm the necessary characteristics for the 5G base stations that are known to have an issue of self-heating. Furthermore, we have coarsely evaluated the probability of two DRAM IC chips being associated with an identical cyber-physical chip identification accidentally. Then, such a probability is minimal.

ID SENSING ALGORITHM
AB Information fusion has been a topic of immense interest owing to its applicability in various applications. This brings to the fore the need for a flexible and accurate fusion algorithm that can be versatile. The Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is one such fusion algorithm. It has since its inception found numerous applications that deal with the fusion of data from multiple sources. The uniqueness of the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is the ease with which the data from multiple sensors in a local system can be fused and also reach consensus in a distributed system with the added capability of fault tolerance. Blockchain has found its use as a distributed ledger and has successfully supported and fueled many crypto-currencies over the years. Information fusion with regards to Blockchains is a topic of great research interest in the past couple of years. Since blockchain has no official node, the introduction of a decentralized network and a consensus algorithm is required in making the interactions and exchanges between multiple suppliers easier and thus leads to business being carried out without any hassles. In this paper, we attempt to understand and describe the deployment of multiple sensors to measure various aspects of the physical world. We discuss a novel technique of employing the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm in the design of the system that would decentralize the data source from the corresponding measurements and thus ensure the integrity of the transactions in the Blockchain. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the performance of the algorithm when used in a blockchain based decentralized environment is also discussed.

ID BIG-DATA; AUDIT; PERSPECTIVE; WELFARE; TRENDS; TIME
AB The emergence of enormous disparate data sources, available in a multitude of alternate formats, and on very different devices, is leading to a business process revolution. This paper argues for a new approach in which these technologies are used to replace outdated blanket government intervention programs. Highly targeted interventions for social programs identified and addressed by Big Data-based methodologies would replace outdated government programs. This approach advocates for original detective methodologies, direct government action, and outcome monitoring all of which utilize Big Data-based frequent examination. The government would be in a privileged situation where it could obtain data not available to most other parties due to privacy laws. The data structures of the government would be protected by encryption and blockchain privacy-protection methodologies that would only reveal targeted outcomes to the direct-action agent. These same methodologies are applicable for business measurement (accounting) and assurance (audit).

AB Blockchain and smart contracts are evolving business practices by enhancing efficiencies and transparency in the value chain. The fusion of these innovations is also likely to transform auditing by automating workflows but more importantly, by enhancing audit effectiveness and reporting. This paper envisions the future financial statement audit by proposing an external audit blockchain that supports smart audit procedures. The external audit blockchain has the potential to improve audit quality and narrow the expectation gap between auditors, financial statement users, and regulatory bodies.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control requires coordinated efforts and collaboration at all levels of governmental bodies, non-for-profit organizations, and private sectors. However, the target is difficult to achieve due to challenges arising from conflicts of interest and lack of trust between stakeholders. Thus, we propose a distributed carbon ledger (DCL) system using blockchain technology. Our analysis suggests that the adoption of DCL not only strengthens the corporate accounting system for carbon asset management but also fits within existing market-based emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Blockchain-enabled DCL allows the integration of national emission trading schemes (ETSs) and corporate carbon asset management into a synthetic single mechanism.

AB This case promotes discussions about blockchain technology. It shows a transaction execution scenario and its tax implications. The case provides (1) an overview of the steps required to install a Digital Wallet; (2) an explanation of the need to add cryptocurrencies to the wallet in order to transact on the blockchain; (3) an overview of executing a transaction, in which an accounting consulting service is provided in the exchange of a cryptocurrency; (4) methods to review the existing transaction, from the service provider side, the service receiver side, and from the blockchain side, with a highlight of the role of both internal and external auditors; (5) clarifies the importance of dealing with cryptocurrencies, given that the IRS identifies cryptocurrencies as properties; and (6) a reflection on the link between a company ERP system and the transaction information on the blockchain.

AB This essay investigates the potential of smart contracts to replace the legal system as an infrastructure for transactions. It argues that (contract) law remains relevant for most transactions even if they are entirely structured by way of smart contract. The reason for this is that the power of smart contracts to create and enforce obligations against attempts by the legal system to thwart their execution is limited. These limitations are most relevant for obligations to perform certain actions outside the blockchain, but also apply to other obligations contingent on facts outside the records stored on the blockchain.

ID MECHANISM DESIGN
AB Democracy requires rules that are designed to prevent the abuse of power and money. Blockchain technology is sometimes heralded as a solution to mitigate the problems associated with voting procedures, such as counting errors, fraud, or the improper use of money to influence the outcome of the collective choice procedure. In this article, I argue that the democratic potential of the blockchain hinges on the specific design of the rules governing the validation of blocks. In support of this argument, I shed light on the governance problems raised by standard protocols such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and on-chain voting.

ID TRACEABILITY; IMPLEMENTATION; SAFETY
AB The use of smart contracts and blockchain tokens to implement a consumer trustworthy ingredient certification scheme for commingled foods, i.e., recipe based, food products is described. The proposed framework allows ingredients that carry any desired property (including social or environmental customer perceived value) to be certified by any certification authority, at the moment of harvest or extraction, using the IGR Ethereum token. The mechanism involves the transfer of tokens containing the internet url published at the authority's web site from the farmer all along the supply chain to the final consumer at each transfer of custody of the ingredient using the Cricital Tracking Event/Key Data Elements (CTE/KDE) philosophy of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). This allows the end consumer to easily inspect and be assured of the origin of the ingredient by means of a mobile application. A successful code implementation of the framework was deployed, tested and is running as a beta version on the Ethereum live blockchain as the IGR token. The main contribution of the framework is the possibility to ensure the true origin of any instance or lot of ingredient within a recipe to the customer, without harming the food processor legitimate right to protect its recipes and suppliers.

DT Article
AB Blockchain technology can increase visibility in supply-chain transactions and lead to more accurate tracing of goods as well as provide evidence of whether a product is authentic or not. A shared, distributed ledger or blockchain alone, however, does not guarantee correct and trustworthy supply-chain traceability. We argue that blockchain technology (and any other digital traceability solution) must be enhanced with methods to "anchor" physical objects into information technology, Internet-of-Things and blockchain systems. Only when trust from the digital domain is extended to the physical domain can the movement of goods be accurately traced (e.g., for callbacks and provenance) and product authenticity determined. In this paper, we introduce the concept of crypto anchors, propose a classification and system architecture, and give implementation examples for different use cases and industries.

TI Supporting private data on Hyperledger Fabric with secure multiparty
   computation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Hyperledger Fabric is a "permissioned" blockchain architecture, providing a consistent distributed ledger, shared by a set of "peers" that must all have the same view of its state. For many applications, it is desirable to keep private data on the ledger, but the same-view principle makes it challenging to implement. In this paper, we explore supporting private data on Fabric using secure multiparty computation (MPC). In our solution, peers encrypt their private data before storing it on the chain and use secure MPC whenever such private data are needed in a transaction. We created a demo of our solution, implementing a bidding system where sellers list assets on the ledger with a secret reserve price, and bidders publish their bids on the ledger but keep secret the bidding price. We implemented a smart contract that runs the auction on this secret data, using a simple secure-MPC protocol that was built using the EMP-toolkit library. We identified two basic services that should be added to Hyperledger Fabric to support our solution, inspiring follow-up work to implement and add these services to the Hyperledger Fabric architecture.

TI Blockchain: An enabler for healthcare and life sciences transformation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
AB Major trends in healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) include huge amounts of and longitudinal patient data, policies on a patient's rights to access and control their data, a move from fee-for-service to outcome-based contracts, and regulatory and privacy requirements. Blockchain, as a distributed transactional system of record, can provide underpinnings to enable these trends and enable transformative opportunities in HCLS by providing immutable data on a shared ledger, secure and authenticated transactions, and smart contracts that can represent rules that are executed with secure transactions. We describe HCLS use cases leveraging these facets of blockchain, including patient consent and health data exchange, outcome-based contracts, next-generation clinical trials, supply chain, and payments and claims. We then describe a blockchain-based architecture and platform for enabling these use cases. Finally, we outline a realization of this architecture in a case study and outline further research topics in this domain.

AB Blockchain records track information about financial payments, movements of products through supply chains, identity verification information, and many other assets. Analytics on this data can provide provenance histories, predictive planning, fraud identification, and regulatory compliance. In this paper, we describe analytics engines connected to blockchains to provide easy-to-use configurable dashboards, predictive models, provenance histories, and compliance checking. We also describe how blockchain data can be combined with external data sources for secure and private analytics, enable artificial intelligence (AI) model creation over geographically dispersed data, and create a history of model creation enabling provenance and lineage tracking for trusted AI.

TI Endorsement in Hyperledger Fabric via service discovery
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise-grade business applications, such as supply chains, financial transactions, asset management, etc. For that end, HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general-purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain applications comprise two tiers: The "platform" tier defines the data schema and embedding of business rules by means of chaincode and endorsement policies; the "client-side" tier uses the HLF software development kit (SDK) to implement client application logic. The client side should be aware of the deployment address of chaincode and endorsement policies within the platform. In past releases, this was statically configured into the client side. As of HLF v1.2, a new feature called service discovery, presented in this paper, provides APIs that allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus improving the reliability of the application layer and making the HLF platform more consumable.

TI Blockchain anchored supply chain automation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Increasing globalization, e-commerce usage, and social awareness are leading to increased consumer demand for variety, value, convenience, immediacy, verifiable authenticity and provenance, ethical materials sourcing and manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and services after sales. Fulfilling this increased complexity of consumer demand has required supply chains to evolve into multienterprise networks with numerous flow paths in production, merchandising, and fulfillment involving many organizational/institutional handoffs, to effectively manage a large number of complex products with shorter life cycles and high transaction volumes. The supply chain management models of today place higher demands on automation and require a transition from the traditional paradigm of planning followed by long-loop execution for a handful of segments to a paradigm of managing a portfolio of end-to-end instrumented data-rich microsegmented supply chains that are monitored and adjusted in near real time. These essential aspects and challenges of supply chain management require the supporting information technology to also evolve. In this paper, we propose a novel reference software architecture to address the complex requirements of modern supply chains that also integrates blockchain into several layers of the stack. We present several examples where this reference architecture is applicable, and then demonstrate through a use case in production that integrating blockchain technology helps with providing visibility, documenting provenance, and allowing permissioned data access to facilitate the automation of many high-volume tasks such as reconciliations, payments, and settlements.

TI Automatic smart contract generation using controlled natural language
   and template
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Smart contracts, which are widely recognized as key components of blockchain technology, enable automatic execution of agreements. Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.

TI Blockchain Solution Reference Architecture (BSRA)
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Enterprise Blockchain network solutions facilitate the extension and optimization of processes across organizational boundaries. This increased level of sharing provides greater visibility, provenance of transactions to all parties involved, and reduces friction that arises due to organizational boundaries. Blockchain Solution Reference Architecture (BSRA) provides comprehensive guidance to architect and build end-to-end solutions based on Blockchain technologies. BSRA was primarily developed based on client engagements across industries such as retail, financial, supply chain, and telco, and addresses two major parts of a Blockchain solution: 1) building a Blockchain business network that receives, builds, and shares blocks in a secure manner; and 2) onboarding members on to the business network with the appropriate level of access and collaboration privileges. BSRA provides a foundational set of architectural artifacts that can help accelerate development of solutions based on Blockchain technologies. It also provides a starter list of architectural decisions that every project will have to set during development.

AB Cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on banking, finance, and monetary systems. Due to the uncertainty as to the possible future trajectories of the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem, governments have taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating such currencies. This approach may be justified within the theoretical information-economics framework of this paper, which draws parallels between the information economics of money and quasi-money creation within the current central banking, commercial banking, and shadow banking systems with that of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In particular, drawing lessons from the literature on the role of information in creating safe assets', in this paper the authors find that by building on symmetric (common) knowledge as to the inner workings of the Bitcoin Blockchain-though in a different way-bitcoin possesses a degree of endogenous information insensitivity typical of safe assets. This endogenous information insensitivity could support bitcoin's promise of maturing into a viable store of value and a niche medium of exchange. This finding should not be overlooked in the policy discussions for potential future regulatory interventions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

AB Blockchain technology is being introduced in all areas and procedures of verification, identification and recording of the virtual world. Some of its applications are simple translations of methods that are already being developed in other technical supports, but most of them provide new utilities that can change the technological context of scientific documentation. In this article we present an updated panorama of the initiatives based on blockchain for the management of scientific and technological documentation, highlighting those aspects that make this new technology a differentiated and authentically novel tool. A critical analysis with theoretical and practical considerations on its potential use completes the content of this work.

TI A Primer for Information Technology General Control Considerations on a
   Private and Permissioned Blockchain Audit
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN AUDITING
LA English
DT Article
DE blockchain; permissioned blockchain; private blockchain; ITGCs; audit
AB Blockchain is a disruptive technology that offers advantages to the audit profession such as transparency into all transactions, an immutable ledger, and the potential for real-time auditing. However, to realize these benefits, the profession must be prepared to gain comfort over blockchains as a component of organizations' information technology infrastructure. This paper considers risks to private and permissioned blockchains through the lens of information technology general controls (ITGCs) as part of an audit of internal control over financial reporting. I discuss new ITGC areas of focus for auditors to consider, along with areas of risk that blockchain could eliminate. To help readers better understand this emerging topic, I provide illustrations, a summary table of key points, and a glossary of blockchain-related terms used throughout the paper. This paper should be viewed as a primer of ITGC considerations on blockchain audits, as more nuanced concerns will emerge as the technology evolves.

TI Legal Consequences of the Invalidity of a Transaction made by Using
   Information 'Technology: Problems of Theory and Practice
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
LA English
DT Article
DE IT-transactions; Blockchain; IT sphere; legal regulation; invalid
   transactions; legal norm; modern information technologies; restitution
AB The article deals with the problem of determination of the peculiarities of legal consequences of invalidity of transactions committed with the use of modern information technologies. The authors believe that the development of modern information technologies has led to the emergence of "new" and "transitional" transactions. The object of the study is completely "new" transactions (for example, IT-transactions that are concluded on the Internet, including using the Blockchain technology) and "transitional transactions", which are only partially different in form and/or manner than traditional ones (for example, electronic transactions, transactions where the object is related to the IT-environment, etc.). As to the consequences of the recognition of transactions invalid, then, in the opinion of the authors, the basis is to take the general model of recognition of invalid transactions, which provides for restitution and compensation for damage. Particular attention should be paid to the recognition of invalid IT-transactions to the "a priori validity" of such transactions, which can create significant risks for users of the blockade software platform and make it difficult to protect their rights in the future. The results obtained is seen in the creation of a new concept of the law in the information society with the development of an appropriate legal mechanism for the protection of the rights of their participants, in particular, the concept of the invalidity of IT-transactions and their legal implications.

AB Although the fintech subject has been widely discussed in the press and communications media, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term in the scientific literature and the key research topics and trends. Aiming to narrow this gap, the objective of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out new routes and opportunities in the field. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation. Finally, subjects related to financial services operation particularly deal with risks of financial loss related to different factors involved in the business environment of these organizations.

AB Geoengineering is a proposed response to anthropogenic global warming (AGW). Conventionally it consists of two strands: Solar Radiation Management (SRM), which is fast-acting, incomplete but inexpensive, and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), which is slower acting, more expensive, and comprehensive. Pairing SRM and CDR offers a contractually complete solution for future emissions if effectively-scaled and coordinated. SRM offsets warming, while CDR takes effect. We suggest coordination using a blockchain, i.e. smart contracts and a distributed ledger. Specifically, we integrate CDR futures with time and volume-matched SRM orders, to address emissions contractually before release. This provides an economically and environmentally proportionate solution to CO2 emissions at the wellhead, with robust contractual transparency, and minimal overhead cost.
   Our proposal offers a 'polluter pays' implementation of Long & Shepherds SRM 'bridge' concept. This 'polluter geoengineers' approach mandates and verifies emissions linked payments with minimal friction, delay, or cost. Finally, we compare alternative market designs against this proposal, finding that this proposal offers several advantages. We conclude that blockchain implementation of the 'polluter geoengineers' approach is attractive and feasible for larger wellhead contracts. We also identify a handful of advantages and disadvantages that merit further study.

AB The article titled "Defining Supply Chain Management" published in 2001 in the Journal of Business Logistics has been cited over 4,900 times in the last 17 years. In this paper, we first provide a historical review of how the article originated and the contributions the article made to both the theory and practice of supply chain management (SCM). Next, we highlight the key market and technological changes that have emerged in SCM followed by how the theory proposed in the 2001 article can still be relevant to support SCM research and practice going forward. We also propose ways of configuring a supply chain and partnering across companies to serve customers in an optimal way. We conclude with a call for research on developing new frameworks to better describe, explain, predict, and shed light on the evolving nature of SCM.

TI Blockchain technology: development and prospects
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB It has been more than 10 years since Satoshi Nakamoto published his famous paper entitled Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, which set the foundation of blockchain technology. Accompanied by the price volatility of bitcoins from 2017 to 2018, blockchain has been a hot word on the internet, and particularly hot in China. Blockchain offers a distributed and secure system for data storage and value transactions. Its applications are springing up in multiple fields.
   The Chinese government is considering these trends with great caution. Initial coin offering has been banned in China since September 2017. By contrast, an official white paper on China's blockchain technology, which was released in May 2018, said that blockchain technology will be widely applied in the real economy of China within 3 years. In a recent panel discussion held by National Science Review, experts talked about related topics. Their opinions may provide a quick view of the future development of blockchain in China and abroad.

ID BIG DATA
AB The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and behavioral/predictive analytics, and blockchain are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech start-ups. The impact from the smartification' of public services and the national infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector given government's function and importance to every institution and individual. Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public engagement, Robo-advisors to support civil servants, real-time management of the national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain, automated compliance/regulation, public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers, online judicial and dispute resolution systems, and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart contracts. Government is potentially the major client' and also public champion' for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform public services and support the work of civil servants.

AB Currently, there is no consensus on the real properties of Bitcoin. The discussion comprises its use as a speculative or safe haven asset, while other authors argue that the augmented attractiveness could end up accomplishing money's properties that economic theory demands. This paper explores the association between Bitcoin's market price and a set of internal and external factors by employing the Bayesian structural time series approach (BSTS). The idea behind BSTS is to create a superposition of layers such as cycles, trend, and explanatory variables that are allowed to vary stochastically over time, additionally, it is possible to perform a variable selection through the application of the Spike and Slab method. This study aims to contribute to the discussion of Bitcoin price determinants by differentiating among several attractiveness sources and employing a method that provides a more flexible analytic framework that decomposes each of the components of the time series, applies variable selection, includes information on previous studies, and dynamically examines the behavior of the explanatory variables, all in a transparent and tractable setting. The results show that the Bitcoin's price is negatively associated with the price of gold as well as the exchange rate between Yuan and US Dollar, while positively correlated to stock market index, USD to Euro exchange rate and diverse signs among the different countries' search trends.
