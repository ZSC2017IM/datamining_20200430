AB The rapid development of Internet of Things technology has led to the sharp increase of the number of interconnected devices. A large amount of data is generated by large-scale IoT devices. In this paper, we propose PDash with parallel distributed architecture, a scalable blockchain-based platform for IoT data storage and sharing. PDash aims to solve the bottleneck problem of blockchain system: scalability, and makes it possible for users to keep ownership of their own data as well as share data securely with economic feedback. PDash integrates decentralized blockchain network and distributed storage network to achieve secure data storage, validation and sharing, and utilizes multiple encryption technologies to enable efficient interaction between two parallel distributed networks.

AB Despite that the cloud computing is considered as the panacea of processing and analyzing IoT data, it shows drawbacks in many other aspects like latency, bandwidth, and mobility when transferring data from connected devices to the cloud. The fog computing paradigm extends the cloud and refers to a geographically distributed computing paradigm at the edge of IoT networks. However, realizing fog computing still has a long way to go, especially when it comes to security in the context of IoT unconventional characteristics such as scalability, heterogeneity, mobility and limited resources. In addition, applying social network principles to the IoT seems to be appealing to build the Internet of Things as a network of peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid architecture for the Internet of things, combing fog computing to ensure security in the trustless IoT environment. By enabling our fog computing architecture with blockchain-based social networks, users could easily manage smart objects via establishing tamper-proof digital identities in a trustless environment and build a new class of authentication and authorization mechanisms for the IoT. We also demonstrate and analyze the feasibility of our architecture with a prototype.

AB In recent years, the advancement in modern technologies has not only resulted in an explosion of huge data sets being captured and recorded in different fields, but also given rise to concerns in the security and protection of data during storage, transmission, processing, and access. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure, flexible, verifiable and permanent way. Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record. In this paper, we have developed a blockchain access control ecosystem that gives asset owners the sovereign right to effectively manage access control of large data sets and protect against data breaches. The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is used to run the business network while the Hyperledger composer modeling tool is used to implement the smart contracts or transaction processing functions that run on the blockchain network.

AB This paper presents a new design approach for Access Control services leveraging smart contracts provided by blockchain technology. The key idea of our proposal is to codify Access Control policies as executable smart contracts on a blockchain. This transforms the policy evaluation process into completely distributed smart contract executions. In our fully blockchain based approach also the Attribute Managers required for the evaluation of the Access Control policies are managed by the blockchain, i.e., they are implemented as smart contracts as well. To study the feasibility of our proposal we present a working reference implementation using XACML policies and Solidity written smart contracts deployed on Ethereum. Finally we evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of the proposal, making also use of experimental results of our reference implementation.

AB We present a distributed ledger application for the world of citizen philanthropy and social entrepreneurship, with stakeholder incentives designed to increase social good through accountability, transparency, and flexibility. In this system, called Directed Cash, individual donors specify conditions (the "Directed" part) attached to their donation or investment ("Cash"), that are then efficiently paired with interested recipients or aggregators of recipients (charities, social entrepreneurs) using distributed consensus so that the intent and pairing are open while maintaining donor anonymity. Furthermore, Directed Cash flows both ways to promote accountability and transparency: after receipt, a validation flows backwards to return to the donor so that the donor receives a report of how their donation was spent. While some elements of the system borrow from existing cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, we propose alternative incentives for distributed consensus that are better aligned with the application and promote social good through the stakeholders. This paper describes the goals and concepts, and a system design to achieve these goals, a primary feature of which is a simple SQL-like language to enable specifying conditions, pairing, aggregation and publicly-verifiable reporting.

AB With the development of information and communication technology, the amount of data in the world is increasing dramatically every day. Now data has been recognized as a valuable asset, and monetization from valuable data becomes an urgent need. In light of this, many data trading platforms have emerged in recent years. Existing data trading schemes, however, generally rely on a third party to trade data. These schemes suffer from complex transaction process, high transaction cost, and possibly unfair exchange. In this paper, we propose two secure, fair and efficient data trading schemes that do not rely on any third party using blockchain. The first scheme achieves direct raw data exchange for large amount of data, while the second scheme achieves data statistics trading. We implement both our schemes with smart contracts, and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate their performance. The experiment results show that they are highly efficient in trading data: the first scheme can trade 100,000 data records within 1.51s, while the second scheme can process a statistic over a data set of 1,024 records within 1.99s.

AB For decades it has been acknowledged that sharing security information and collaboration between security practitioners are a necessity. Yet, effective sharing and collaboration are rare. A gamut of legislative acts, executive orders, academic works, and private sector initiatives have discussed aspects of the problem and aimed to be the catalyst needed to fix the situation. But almost 30 years since these efforts started, the state of sharing and collaboration is still technically complicated, slow, untrusted, and impeded by bureaucratic woes.
   This work identifies the challenges of sharing security artifacts and uses real-world examples to illustrate our findings. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new model for sharing and collaboration, CARE. The CARE architecture eases many of the privacy, secrecy, lineage, and structure issues that plague current sharing communities and platforms. We then build upon this foundation to introduce a marketplace based on smart contracts with transactional privacy over a distributed blockchain. Therefore, CARE incentivizes sharing, combats free riding, and provides an immutable ledger for the attribution of events. This paradigm shift, overcomes the challenges of sharing while providing new opportunities for business models, insurance risk assessments, and government backed incentivisation.

AB The emerging data-driven techniques have greatly increased the demand for effective data sharing infrastructure, which is our fundamental motivation in designing effective data trade paradigms. One of the critical challenges of data sharing is to achieve a good trade-off between the privacy and data utility. To address this challenge, in this paper we exploit the Blockchain techniques and contract theory to design a Blockchain-based peer-to-peer data trading mechanism. In our proposed mechanism, the data trading is supported by Ethereum Blockhain technique. To effectively capture and regulate the complex interaction between the data aggregators (AGG) and the data owners, we propose a contract theoretic approach to design the smart contract that is the essential component of Ethereum Blockchain. The performance of our proposed Blockchain-enabled data trading mechanism is evaluated.

AB Blockchain technology is a ledger system that is popularly known as the backbone of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Since its conception, the potential beneficial applications of blockchain in other digital sectors have been lauded in the literature, and related challenges have been disputed. In this study, the literature is reviewed for frameworks and use cases that fully realize the applicability of blockchain beyond financial applications and cryptocurrencies. A network analysis of the literature was performed to identify the most popularly documented digital sectors in this context, which include the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, supply chain management, and government sectors. For each sector, this review documents use cases in which an attempt is made to implement blockchain solutions. The main purpose of this paper is to probe each sector for the growing maturity of blockchain technology and to document the unique benefits and challenges arising from the use of this technology. The findings show that despite the growing reputation of blockchain technology, its implementation within these four sectors remains in infancy because the use cases lack concrete evaluations of its effectiveness and plausibility. Nevertheless, the categorization of current blockchain use cases demonstrates current applications and sector-specific concerns that suggest future directions for further research.

ID SECURITY
AB This publication explores global problem areas where properties offered by Blockchain provide workable solutions for the existing widely unsolved problems of Accountability, Traceability, Identification, Visibility vs. Privacy, and Connection of Non-Deterministic to Deterministic timed events. Using BlockChain-based transactions, we demonstrate that operations related to trust are reducible to five directly implementable cryptographic actions, which then create relationships to five categories of trust that we define in this document. The solution outlined will take the approach that the identified global problems will be solved by blockchain as cybersecurity of the future moves in a direction of individualized transactional-based security & privacy. Developers and organizations looking to implement new solutions or integrate blockchain into existing applications would be interested in this publication. Methods described provide workable solutions for implementing trust relationships using blockchain for positive use cases which can be related directly to cyber security industry solutions.

AB Trust management is extremely important for sensor networks, and the emerging vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) does not represent an exception. In fact, it allows to realize a dynamic access control needed to cope with internal attacks conducted by compromised nodes, which are likely to occur in real world. However, trust management implies a considerable consumption of energy, due to the amount of messages exchanged to collect reputation scores. Consumption is further exacerbated by the means needed to protect from attacks the trust management entities themselves.
   This work proposes a suitable trust management for the IoT by exploiting the eventual consistency and security guarantees of blockchain. The design of a solution based on such a technology is described, and a qualitative assessment of its protection degree is provided.

AB In Bitcoin, it is well known that the confirmation of a transaction issued by a user takes a longer time than the mean block-generation time of 10 minutes. In order to understand the stochastic behavior of the transaction-confirmation process, we consider a queueing model with batch service and general input. In our queueing model, we assume that the transaction interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and follow a general distribution, and that the transactions waiting in the queue are served in a batch manner. We define the number of transactions in queue just before a transaction arrival as the system state, deriving the steady-state distribution and the mean transaction-confirmation time by matrix analytic method. In numerical examples, we compare analytical results with trace-driven simulation, discussing the applicability of our queueing model to the prediction of the transaction-confirmation time. It is found that exponential-type distributions such as exponential distribution and hyper-exponential one can accurately estimate the mean transaction-confirmation time for the current maximum block-size limit of 1 Mbyte.

AB The immense promise of reinventing business processes has led to the development of alternative blockchain technologies, such as consortium blockchain, that can deal with some of the issues of public blockchains such as used in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. However, a consortium blockchain, where its tokens have no market value, suffers from a lack of a method for payment for services, since the authority is concentrated with the entities that secure payment. Here, we describe Niji, a new cross-chain payment protocol that allows parties to perform Bitcoin payment securely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediator. Niji introduces templatization of a transaction to validate Bitcoin payments efficiently on different consortium blockchains. The process from payment to service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties. An experiment measuring the computational cost and latency demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of our implementation.

AB The presence of forks in permissionless blockchains is a recurrent issue. So far this has been handled either a posteriori, through local arbitration rules (e.g., "keep the branch which has required the most computational power") which are applied once a fork is present in the blockchain, or a priori, via a Byzantine resilient agreement protocol periodically invoked by a committee of well identified and online nodes. In the former case, local arbitration rules guarantee that if they are correctly applied by a majority of users, then with high probability forks are progressively resolved, while in the latter case, the sequence of Byzantine resilient agreements decide on the unique sequence of blocks to be appended to the blockchain. The question we may legitimately ask is the following one: To prevent the period of uncertainty inherent to optimistic-based solutions, are we doomed to rely on the decisions made by a unique committee whose members are already actively involved in the creation of blocks ? We negatively answer this question by presenting a solution that combines the best features of optimistic and pessimistic approaches: we leverage the presence of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) owners and "the public-key as identities" principle to make UTXO owners (i.e. users) self-organize in small Byzantine resilient committees "around" each new object (i.e., blocks and transactions) to decide on their validity. Validated objects are conflict-free, which guarantees the absence of blockchain forks and allows for fast-payment transactions facility. This is achieved without fearing Sybil attacks and selfish mining attacks. We are not aware of any solutions enjoying such features.

ID CONSENSUS
AB As an alternative to the energy greedy proof-of-work, new blockchains constrain the set of participants whose selection is debatable. These blockchains typically allow a fixed consortium of machines to decide upon new transaction blocks.
   In this paper, we introduce the community blockchain that bridges the gap between these public blockchains and constrained blockchains. The idea is to allow potentially all participants to decide upon "some" block while restricting the set of participants deciding upon "one" block.
   We also propose an implementation called ComChain that builds upon the Red Belly Blockchain, the fastest blockchain we are aware of. It runs a consensus among the existing community to elect a new community. This reconfiguration speeds up as the number of removed nodes increases.

AB Removing the need for a trusted third party, blockchain technology revolutionizes the field of identity management. Service providers rely on digital identities to securely identify, authenticate and authorize users to their services. Traditionally, these digital identities are offered by a central identity provider belonging to a specific organisation. Trust in the digital identity mainly originates from the identity provider's reputation, organizational functioning and contractual obligations. Blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralized identity management without a central identity provider as trusted third party. Therefore, the derivation of trust in digital identities within this paradigm requires a distinct approach. In this paper we propose a novel general quantifiable trust model and a specific implementation variant for blockchain-based identity management. Applying the model, trust is deduced in a decentralized manner from attestations of claims and applied to the associated digital identity. This concept replaces trust with a central identity provider by aggregated trust into attestation issuers. Thus, promoting self-sovereign identities to be fit for purpose. The calculated numerical trust metric serves as independent basis for the definition of assurance levels to simplify and automate reasoning about trust by service providers without requiring a dedicated evaluation of a trusted third party.

AB Since Bitcoin and Blockchain became popular, various industries have been interested in applying Blockchain technology to their business. Companies have been working on many Proof-of-Concepts to find good use cases. To find use cases quickly in the fast-changing environment around Blockchain, companies repeat short-term Proof-of-Concepts many times. There is some work on evaluation methods for Blockchain-based systems like the evaluation form validating the feasibility of Blockchain-based systems with comprehensive evaluation items and prototypes. However, the previous evaluation methods do not satisfy the tight time constraints of Proof-of-Concepts conducted by companies. It takes a long time to define evaluation indices, implement measurement tools and run a series of tests for all evaluation items. It also takes more time to repeat the evaluation to compare multiple Blockchain-based systems using different Blockchain software products.
   In this paper, we propose a practical screening method for Blockchain-based systems. To reduce time spent on Proof-of-Concepts, the screening phase with a simple check form is introduced before the prototyping phase. Throughout the screening phase, a screening form selects a few Blockchain software products which demonstrate good coverage of requirements for a use case in terms of network topology, settlement finality, governance, privacy/confidentiality and application architecture. After choosing a few promising Blockchain software products, the prototyping phase follows. Prototypes using selected Blockchain software products are evaluated by filling comprehensive evaluation items like the previous methods. The time required for Proof-of-Concepts decreases due to eliminating unpromising Blockchain software products in the screening phase. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we had a case study. The result showed that the estimated workload of a Proof-of-Concept decreased by 59% compared to the previous method.

AB The financial industry is faced with attractive business opportunities to adopt blockchain. To make such an investment, decision makers need answers to a number of questions including: what existing business problems will be solved, will blockchain solve them, and what long term benefits and new business opportunities blockchain can create. In this paper we analyze security aspects of these questions, focusing on the protection of integrity of data and financial transactions. We start from the analysis of an essential security architecture of financial systems which is based on the perimeter protection and traditional business process safeguards such as maker-checker. Subsequently, we look at the options on how to improve such an architecture to provide protection against malicious internal users and malware implanted inside the system; the vulnerabilities that have been exploited by organized criminal teams of attackers in the attacks seen lately. We show that the improvements based on the preventive safeguards, inherent to blockchain security architecture, provide strong protection against those attacks. Finally, we argue that in comparison with typically used detective measures (e.g. monitoring), security architecture based on the blockchain model provides superior protection against attacks using attack scenarios never seen before.

AB Large files cannot be efficiently stored on blockchains. On one hand side, the blockchain becomes bloated with data that has to be propagated within the blockchain network. On the other hand, since the blockchain is replicated on many nodes, a lot of storage space is required without serving an immediate purpose, especially if the node operator does not need to view every file that is stored on the blockchain. It furthermore leads to an increase in the price of operating blockchain nodes because more data needs to be processed, transferred and stored. IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain. Nonetheless, IPFS does not permit users to share files with selected parties. This is necessary, if sensitive or personal data needs to be shared. Therefore, this paper presents a modified version of the InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS) that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to provide access controlled file sharing. The smart contract is used to maintain the access control list, while the modified IPFS software enforces it. For this, it interacts with the smart contract whenever a file is uploaded, downloaded or transferred. Using an experimental setup, the impact of the access controlled IPFS is analyzed and discussed.

AB Insurances are a way of financial risk mitigation that pay the user in case of damage. However, once the event happens, the user does not get paid immediately due to the large degree of human interaction required. In this paper, we automate insurance payment by using smart contracts. As additional contribution, our design supports integration of IoT devices to register events that trigger insurance contracts and offers additional privacy-protection even on public blockchains. In order to allow users to retrieve their payment from the insurance contract anonymously we remove the linkability and traceability between events that triggers the contract and the insurance holder by applying ring signatures. Using a prototypical implementation based on Ethereum, we study the additional overhead and cost that our design incurs and can show that exploiting latest features of Ethereum, gas cost can be driven down substantially compared to earlier approaches. In sum, we propose, implement, and evaluate a design for smart insurance contracts integrating IoT sensors and including additional privacy protection using ring signatures.

AB The idea to digitally facilitate contract law and business practices through computer programs has led to the notion of smart contracts. Today's most prominent smart contract ecosystem is Ethereum, a blockchain based distributed computing platform. Due to the inherent nature of blockchain based contract execution, missing low level programming abstractions, and the constant evolution of platform features and security considerations, writing correct and secure smart contracts for Ethereum is a difficult task. Based on a Multivocal Literature Research and an analysis of the gathered data based on qualitative research methods, we mined a number of design patterns providing design guidelines. We describe those patterns in detail and provide exemplary code for better illustration. Our research shows that the patterns are widely used to address application requirements and common problems. We expect generalizability of some or all of the patterns for other smart contract ecosystems, but this is outside of the scope of this study, which studied only smart contract patterns in Ethereum.

AB A review system is a valuable component in E-commerce applications. Existing centralized review systems are prone to review frauds and manipulations. A decentralized, immutable and auditable blockchain system is a natural fit to prevent fraudulent and manipulated reviews. We develop and implement ReviewChain, a decentralized review system using Ethereum smart contract. ReviewChain validates new reviews by querying the identity of purchasers from a supply chain system. We assume that the supply chain system is based on blockchain technology. We develop and implement a mechanism to tie two disparate Ethereum based blockchain networks. Ethereum smart contract code is limited and cannot make external procedure calls. Therefore, we introduce multi-blockchain gateway nodes called notaries. Our proposed smart contracts and notaries allow us to interface two blockchains effectively. We run ReviewChain and discuss how various design parameters impact the system performance.

AB Poverty alleviation loan plays an important role in the poverty alleviation strategy of China. To improve the loan service efficiency and reduce service cost, it is necessary to build a management system for this business. However, current management systems for the loan are usually deployed in single service mode, also the transactions are not transparent and traceable to most of the roles participating in the process. Its data privacy protection mechanism is not robust enough facing various cyber attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose loan on blockchain (LoC), a novel poverty alleviation loan management system based on smart contracts. A digital account model is designed for the transfer of assets between centralized and decentralized ledgers, and locking and unlocking algorithms are introduced for smart contracts. Digital signature and oracle are introduced to protect the data privacy.

DE blockchain; permissioned; data asset; application
AB The set of distributed ledger architectures known as blockchain is best known for cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These permissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the financial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by the maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and the increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating nodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become centralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a dominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted environments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus mechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands and non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper describes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain that uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a standard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger framework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data management.

AB While smart contracts are praised widely, it should be noted that they have their disadvantages: lack of control over data protection and executive correctness or consistency. Aiming at this problem, we propose SMPC-based smart contract platform with three-layer structure: contract, computing, and group communication layer. In contract layer, we put forward SMPC-based smart contract framework, which gives the implementation process, language structure and grammar specification of smart contracts. In computing layer, fair SMPC algorithms based on general linear secret sharing scheme are designed to implement verifiable collaboration computing with input privacy and computation correctness. In group communication layer, the non-blocking broadcast is developed from non-blocking message passing interface (MPI) in order to ensure secure group communication in asynchronous networks with node and link failures. Finally, the results of simulation experiments with private currency transfers indicate that our platform is efficient and secure enough for common smart contracts.

AB The distributed consensus problem has been extensively studied in the last four decades as an important problem in distributed systems. Recent advances in decentralized consensus and blockchain technology, however, arose from a disparate model and gave rise to disjoint knowledge-base and techniques than those in the classical consensus research. In this paper we make a case for bridging these two seemingly disparate approaches in order to help transfer the lessons learned from the classical distributed consensus world to the blockchain world and vice versa. To this end, we draw parallels between blockchain consensus and a classical consensus protocol, Paxos. We also survey prominent approaches to improving the throughput and providing instant irreversibility to blockchain consensus and show analogies to the techniques from classical consensus protocols. Finally, inspired by the central role formal methods played in the success of classical consensus research, we suggest more extensive use of formal methods in modeling the blockchains and smartcontracts.

AB As more and more data is collected for various reasons, the sharing of such data becomes paramount to increasing its value. Many applications ranging from smart cities to personalized health care require individuals and organizations to share data at an unprecedented scale. Data sharing is crucial in today's world, but due to privacy reasons, security concerns and regulation issues, the conditions under which the sharing occurs needs to be carefully specified. Currently, this process is done by lawyers and requires the costly signing of legal agreements. In many cases, these data sharing agreements are hard to track, manage or enforce. In this work, we propose a novel alternative for tracking, managing and especially adjudicating such data sharing agreements using smart contracts and blockchain technology. We design a framework that generates smart contracts from parameters based on legal data sharing agreements. The terms in these agreements are automatically adjudicating by the system. Monetary punishment can be employed using secure voting by external auditors to hold the violators accountable. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposed framework is efficient and low-cost.

AB Technology has positive impacts on many aspects of our social life. Designing a 24 hour globally connected architecture enables ease of access to a variety of resources and services. Furthermore, technology like the Internet has been a fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One such disruptive innovation is blockchain - a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is presented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging technologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation factor to the current parity between consumers and large corporations/governments. One potential application of the blockchain is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open, fair, and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose a potential new e-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The protocol has been designed to adhere to fundamental e-voting properties as well as offer a degree of decentralisation and allow for the voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period). This paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from a practical point view in both development/deployment and usage contexts. Concluding the paper is a potential roadmap for blockchain technology to be able to support complex applications.

AB The Internet of Things aims at connecting everything ranging from individuals, organizations, companies to things in the physical and virtual world. The digital identity has always been considered as the keystone for all online services and the foundation for building security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, current literature still lacks of a comprehensive research on the digital identity management for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we identify digital identity challenges and solutions for the Internet in general. We then focus on how existing solutions cope with IoT requirements such as scalability, interoperability, mobility, security and privacy. We also investigate recent surging blockchain sovereign identity solutions and enumerate some projects and startups which are focusing on IoT identity problems. Furthermore, we elaborate challenges of building identity management systems for the IoT, including access control, privacy preserving, trust and performance respectively. At last, we conclude with the promising future research trends in building IoT identity management systems.

AB Recently, we have witnessed a trend that many industries are forming consortiums and attempting to accelerate efficiency and reduce cost by using blockchain technology. Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industryscale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.

AB Current blockchains often are designed with one use case in mind, such as currency transfer in Bitcoin or record storage in Namecoin. While application-specific blockchains are powerful tools for fulfilling their niche use cases, there are blockchains like Ethereum that have a set of use cases comprising a superset of the use cases of many blockchains. These generalized blockchains are powerful tools for extending decentralization to new use cases without designing entirely new blockchains.
   This paper considers tradeoffs in the design and implementation of blockchain systems that intend to deliver general functionality and examines various current and Merged-mining, fragmentation, the network effect, scalability, and generalized blockchain approaches are all considered and put into context. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Rootstock are considered in various aspects of the current limitations, and potential future solutions to problems noted.
   This paper weighs the chances of success of various generalized blockchain paradigms, including the network effect scalability and potential client-side use. We conclude that the network effect likely favors a Bitcoin/sidechain solution while scalability favors a direct Ethereum solution. The likelihood of success of mainstream adoption of any single decentralized application appears to favor an Ethereum solution.

AB Many studies have been done to improve the performance of centrally controlled business processes and enhance the integration between different parties of these collaborations. However, the most serious issues of collaborative business processes remained unsolved in these studies - lack of trust and divided data on various confidential ledgers. Blockchain technology has enormous potential to become a new substantial integration method for untrusted collaborative businesses. Using the governing consensus mechanism, blockchain eliminates the necessity of the trusted third party. It provides a distributed shared ledger which facilitates the job of the process monitoring for the parties. The smart contract, as a crucial tool, is used to define the guaranteed autonomous programs. In addition, the privacy of the data can be ensured by using a permissioned blockchain that handles the access control because, in this way, only verifiable participants can have access to the state of the business process and its related information. In this study, the applicability of execution of a real-world untrusted business process on the permissioned blockchain is investigated. Moreover, we determine the advantages of using the permissioned access-controller blockchain as the infrastructure for the collaborative business processes, through implementing the process of Order Processing on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.

AB Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality requirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when multiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches attempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they currently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing processes. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost, limiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In such contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of recipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a nonfungible token that corresponds to a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are consumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability of product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our evaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of products considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the solution can handle complex use cases.

AB Blockchain-based systems such as cryptocurrencies are achieving widespread usage, with a market capitalization of $150B (USD) as of September 2017. However, the most prominent platforms that account for over 70% of this market - Bitcoin & Ethereum - are exhibiting increasingly lower levels of decentralization. This poses the problem of concentrating levers of consensus to a select group of agents in the system. At the same time, attempts at higher levels of decentralization poses the problem of limiting scalability of such systems. In this paper, using mechanism design we propose a way of designing payoffs in order to disincentivize certain exhibited behaviors and incentivize desired behaviors of miners in such systems. Our approach indicates potential for research in this area for solving the much larger problem of centralization in decentralized systems such as blockchain.

AB Mass penetration and market dominance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are expected in the upcoming years. Due to their frequent charging needs, not only public and private charging stations are being built, but also V2V charging options are considered. This forms a charging network with various suppliers and EV customers which can communicate to schedule charging operations. While an app can be designed to develop matching algorithms for charging schedules, the system also needs a convenient payment method that will enable privacy-preserving transactions among the suppliers and EVs. In this paper, we adopt a Bitcoin-based payment system for the EV charging network payments. However, Bitcoin has a transaction fee which would be comparable to the price of the charging service most of the time and thus may not be attractive to users. High transaction fees can be eliminated by building a payment network in parallel to main ledger, with permission and signatures. In this paper, we design and implement such a network among charging stations and mobile EVs with flow, connectivity and fairness constraints, and demonstrate results for the feasibility of the scheme under different circumstances. More specifically, we propose a payment network optimization model for determining payment channels among charging stations. We present numerical results on the characteristics of the network model by using realistic use cases.

AB Most of the existing RFID based ownership transfer protocols are in need of TTP or require reader to reader communication in a centralized system. In the post supply chain, the products are to be tracked to prove their originality in a distributed environment. This paper aims to provide a verifiable ownership transfer of products attached with an RFID tag using blockchain technology to address various security requirements. The proposed protocol consists of two phases; in the first phase the buyer commits to buy the product and in the second phase actual ownership is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Analysis of the proposed protocol is carried out and it shows that our protocol is relatively better than the existing related schemes with respect to security requirements.

AB The concept of a decentralized ledger usually implies that each node of a blockchain network stores the entire blockchain. However, in the case of popular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount of data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight clients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can result in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is contrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain.
   To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced amount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The properties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily rebuilt from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low storage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain decentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This system paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by low capacity nodes.

AB Enabling keyword search directly over the data stored on the blockchain is a desirable technique that can help in the effective utilization of the data while preserving the privacy. Searchable Encryption (SE) is a well-known technique that allows search queries over the encrypted Cloud data, however, existing solutions are based on the assumption of the Cloud Server being "trusted-but-curious" or "honest-but-curious". This leads to a compelling case to use permissioned blockchain technology to ensure greater levels of security when the Cloud Server is malicious. The amalgamation of SE and permissioned blockchain empowers a client to place complete trust on the Cloud Server and the services it has to offer. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving framework to facilitate keyword search over encrypted data stored on the blockchain network. The framework for the first time studies SE over a permissioned blockchain network i.e., Hyperledger-Fabric. The SE scheme is privacy-preserving as it is based on probabilistic trapdoors. As a result the framework guarantees prominent security and privacy gains.

DE Blockchain; HIPAA; insurance claims; privacy
AB According to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), the medical insurance claim process is carried out by healthcare providers, insurance companies, and clearinghouses. The clearinghouse coordinates the medical insurance claims between providers and insurance companies. As centralized communication hubs, clearinghouses may maliciously or unintentionally leak patient information. In this work, we propose a distributed solution to replace the role of clearinghouses during health insurance claim process and mitigate the risk of data leakage among parties in Healthcare sector. Our solution enhances the patients' privacy protection through developing a HIPAA compliance system for the medical insurance claim process in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. Blockchain ensures transaction integrity and anonymity of cryptocurrencies by using distributed immutable ledgers. We first design data structures for patient information, medical service record, insurance payment, and insurance agreements within the ledger. We then focus on defining smart contracts for privacy assurance, as well as automating the insurance claim process. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework with Hyperledger Fabric, showing promising performance and response time.

AB In this paper we use a case study of a proof-of-concept blockchain system for management of the consent process in sharing of participant health research data. The solution is assessed for the evidentiary value of the records it produces. Based on an archival theoretic evaluation framework, recommendations are provided as to how to increase the evidentiary quality of both on-and off-chain records through design changes or enhancements that would bring the solution into compliance with archival requirements for preservation of trustworthy records.

AB Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) allows multiple organizations to share transaction data while protecting data integrity without the need for a central authority. However, there is a strong need to protect the privacy of transactions from parties that are not stakeholders of each transaction. Since DLT is a technology for sharing replicas of the same ledger data across multiple parties, protecting confidentiality and data privacy is essentially difficult. In this paper, we first define the properties of integrity and privacy requirements and discuss the requirements in typical use cases. Finally, we review how the requirements are addressed in existing implementations.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a name coined to the digital ecosystem of numerous internet connected devices. It brings the physical world closer to the digital one and as a result, allows for new applications and services. The emergence of Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, presents a possible solution to ensure trust in decentralized systems. Blockchain brings trust, immutability, and verifiability of a distributed ledger in a decentralized network which could be useful to build trust in IoT. However, the integration of IoT with Blockchain involves a number of challenges. The use of Blockchain within the IoT is a recent and a fast paced topic. Therefore, conducting a systematic literature review is essential to understand what has been proposed on the topic. Recent work has provided a systematic review with a focus on Bitcoin. In this paper, we present a systematic review of more recent work on Blockchain and IoT, with a broader focus on Blockchain platforms beyond Bitcoin. Our work provides an overview of what has been done so far on the use of Blockchain and IoT.

AB Blockchain and smart contract technology provide a means of decentralised computational agreements that are trusted and automated. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices with blockchain systems and smart contracts, agreements can not only be confined to in-blockchain manipulation of state, however can enable agreements to interact on the physical world. This integration is non-trivial due to the limited resources on IoT devices and the heterogeneity of such an architecture. Such blockchain connected IoT devices typically require programming of smart contracts, edge blockchain nodes and the IoT devices.
   IoT embedded systems require expertise in low level development. Similarly, smart contract programming requires expertise with an extensive attention to detail, as even minor bugs can have catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a macroprogramming approach for developing the different system components required for blockchain connected IoT devices including smart contracts, edge nodes and IoT devices from a monolithic description. In this manner, one can use a higher level of abstraction to develop an application, while still being able to generate code automatically which can be deployed on different nodes.

AB As the deployments of IoT systems grow for a wide range of applications, there are new use-cases emerging where the organizations or individuals that own sensor devices are different from the individuals or organizations that have use for the data from those devices. In such settings it is helpful for the data consumer to be able to effortlessly get data streams in return for monetary payments. The advent of cryptocurrency technologies have made the establishment of bidirectional automatic data micro-payment channels (with data flowing in one direction and micro-payments in the other) feasible. We present an application layer protocol called the streaming data payment protocol (SDPP) which embodies this very idea. The protocol also makes provisions for the data provider to send automated invoices and the data consumer to provide signed receipts for data to be stored on an immutable distributed ledger for auditing and dispute resolution purposes. We present an implementation of SDPP using TCP for data transport and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger.

AB Edge computing has emerged as an effective offloading strategy for constrained devices. It enables low-capability devices to leverage nearby resources for assistance with computationally-intensive tasks. We envision a future where Internet of Things (IoT) devices may autonomously transact with other more powerful devices to request such offloading services. We believe blockchain-based technologies can help facilitate this process by tracking usage and managing payments. In this work we introduce SmartEdge, an Ethereum-based smart contract for edge computing and show that it is a low-cost, low-overhead tool for compute-resource management.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies, people find more and more blockchain applications in the IoT domain. While it is reasonable that IoT systems use hierarchical network structures, their sheer large scales may lead to hundreds or even thousands of non-leaf nodes, which may serve as full nodes when participating in IoT blockchains. From IoT blockchain design perspective, it is important to understand the scalability of the energy consumption feature of IoT blockchains. In our research we have collected real-world data that reflect the energy consumption features of several consensus algorithms of blockchain. In this work-in-progress paper, we report our results based on linear regression models. These models provide reference estimations of the energy consumption impact in designing blockchains for IoT systems.

AB The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has spurred the research interest in technologies associated with it, for instance batteries, and charging mechanisms. Moreover, the recent advancements in autonomous cars also encourage the enabling technologies to integrate and provide holistic applications. To this end, one key requirement for EVs is to have an efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure and framework for charging, billing, and auditing. However, the current manual charging systems for EVs may not be applicable to the autonomous cars that demand new, automatic, secure, efficient, and scalable billing and auditing mechanism. Owing to the distributed systems such as blockchain technology, in this paper, we propose a new charging and billing mechanism for electric vehicles that charge their batteries in a charging-on-the-move fashion. To meet the requirements of billing in electric vehicles, we leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), a distributed peer-to-peer technology for micro-transactions. Our proof-of-concept implementation of the billing framework demonstrates the feasibility of such system in electric vehicles. It is also worth noting that the solution can easily be extended to the electric autonomous cars (EAVs).

AB The recent advancement in Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has captured interest of many researchers in academia and industry. Since its advent, the Blockchain was inherently supposed to be used in combination with cryptocurrencies but currently this technology is being used in other areas as well. One particular area based on the distributed ledger technology that has grabbed the attention of many technologist and financial marketers is "Smart Contracts". Based on a cryptocurrency framework known as Ethereum, these smart contracts can be used for different applications such as Option Pricing, Currency Exchange, Revenue Management System, Crowd-funding and Peer-to-Peer networking. In our current effort, we have designed a smart contract and demonstrate that this smart contract could be used to take various possible positions in an European style option. We have analyzed the contract for potential security vulnerabilities when implemented in Blockchain. These option based smart contracts could be used for collateral contract services among finance industries.

AB The perennial shortage of capital for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups is a critical issue in the policies of many governments. However, due to an atmosphere of public mistrust toward financial systems, governments throughout the world have exerted effort to tighten regulations of financial activities after the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Thus, SMEs and start-ups face increased difficulty in raising capital through traditional financing channels. In this study, we explore how blockchain technology could be applied to capital markets through an angel fund. Blockchain data structure and its consensus algorithm create trust among untrusted entities. This condition enables untrusted parties to interact without the involvement of middlemen, thereby reducing transaction costs and promoting efficiency and transparency of transactions. Furthermore, smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are used to reduce agency problems caused by third-party matching service providers. Based on these ideas, this paper proposes a distributed angel fund matching platform based on blockchain.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) interconnects thousands of sensor nodes to support the services of Internet of Things (IoT). However, data collected from sensor nodes may be tempered, forged and divulged. Traditional WSN data process platform handle the data centralized in terminal devices which is vulnerable to attacks and reduce the security of the system. Blockchain is a kind of distributed databases. It has been successfully applied in finance, securities, digital currency and other fields. We first propose a blockchain-based distributed collocation storage architecture for data security process platform of WSN with consensus protocol and asymmetric signature scheme. The security and efficiency are verified on the simulation to enable blockchain as a good solution.

DE blockchain; UDDI; data replication; SOA
AB Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI), as the main technical support of Web service, plays an increasingly important role in SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). Smart contract technology based on blockchain is used to solve the problem of data replication and sharing between UDDI registries. The UDDI registry only stores the information of simple service description and reference to the blockchain, and provides identity management, authority management, and other functions. The detailed information of the service provider and the services it provides is stored in the blockchain. The cost of the UDDI registry is greatly reduced, and the sharing and storage of data can be easily realized. Meanwhile, the security and auditability of data are guaranteed by the characteristics of the blockchain. This paper innovatively introduces the blockchain into the field of service computing, which provides a new idea for future research.

AB Improving efficiency and performance is an important topic in the world today. As it is well-known, cooperative computing is an effective and traditional approach, and it is widely used in various fields. Inspired by this idea, take E-commerce for example, Security is one of its important indicators. In E-commerce, the security technology has become a major issue restricting the rapid development and popularization of E-commerce. Existing solutions leverage blockchain protocols to improve the credibility of transactions, but most of them have some limitations, such as a lower throughput and higher consensus latency, and these problems make blockchain technology difficult to be widely used. This paper presents a trusted framework (ETTF) using blockchain protocol in E-commerce to achieve a higher credible trading. ETTF includes a peer blockchain protocol (PBP) based on a peer blockchain architecture to support the storage of massive transactions and instant transactions. In PBP, the throughput scales are nearly linearly increased with the computation: the more computing power available, the more blocks are selected per unit time. Besides, in order to ensure a higher security of transactions we have introduced a strong consensus algorithm(ECA) in E-commerce. ETTF is also efficient because the number of messages it requires is nearly linear in the network size. Compared to Bitcoin-derived blockchain, ETTF shows better performance on throughput, latency, and capacity in E-commerce.

AB Blockchain platform has given information system scholars research opportunities in understanding dynamics of convergence of technology and social context. The information system research issues are complex and require taxonomies to understand the similarities and uniqueness among objects. Developing taxonomies is a complex process that needs systematic approach. This paper is a research-in-progress. We proposed taxonomy for Blockchain platform using existing method of developing taxonomies in information systems. With the unprecedented growth led to several companies to develop the varieties of Blockchain platforms. The complexity in the implementation and understanding the technical protocols leading to difficulty face by researchers and practitioners to access their full potentials. To bridge the gap, we proposed a taxonomy of Blockchains distributed ledger platforms in order to provide a mechanism for researchers and practitioners to understand the phenomenon. Final of taxonomy contains five (5) dimensions with fifteen (15) characteristics. Our analysis discovered Blockchain platforms are designed with specific goals, which prescribe its features, i.e FinTech Blockchain platforms for financial domain.

AB This study reports empirical results of a survey on consumer trust in trustless trust facilities provided by distributed ledger technologies, using the example of an app that obtains product-related information from a blockchain. We report results from 82 respondents who were familiarized with the features of the app under consideration. The novelty of this study is that we provide an assessment of consumers' trust regarding the concept of trustless trust. The relevance for practitioners arises from the abundance of quality certifications, eco-labels and product reviews that add confusion rather than orientation to consumer decision processes at the moment of truth (on- or off-line buying decisions) in combination with the increasing popularity of smart contracts, which can be used to store all the relevant information about product details and processing along the supply chain.

AB currently, government identification systems are still underdeveloped. The government has adopted computer technology to serve the policy of Thailand 4.0. Thai national ID still segmented and distributed between government agencies and has no centralization, and it brings bad experience to the users because each service must be registered and the users have to remember the username and password for every service. We demonstrated Thailand national Digital ID Framework based on Blockchain (NIDBC) to help improve digital identity government service to simple single sign-on and kept preserving privacy by providing personal information to service only when users grant permission for each service. In addition, the system is secure because the data is distributed to each node, making the attackers hard to attack or edit information. The security properties of the proposed protocol have been verified using Scyther tool and are presented here with results.

AB Blockchain normalizes applications that run on the internet through the standardization of decentralized data structure, computational requirements and trust in transactions. This new standard has now spawned hundreds of legitimate internet applications in addition to the cryptocurrency revolution. This next frontier that standardizes internet applications will dramatically increase productivity to levels never seen before, especially when applied to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The blockchain framework relies on cryptographic private keys to sign digital data as its foundational principle. Without the security of private keys to sign data blocks, there can be no trust in blockchain. Central storage of these keys for managing IoT machines and users, while convenient to implement, will be highly detrimental to the assumed safety and security of this next frontier. In this paper, we will introduce decentralized and device agnostic cryptographic signing solutions suitable for securing users and machines in blockchain and IoT applications.

AB At present, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECD-SA) is extensively used because its implementation can be achieved more efficiently with the same security level compared to RSA and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). In particular, blockchain and Fast IDentity Online (FIDO), which are attracting attention as key infrastructure technologies to lead the fourth industrial revolution, use ECDSA. However, scalar multiplication, which is the main operation of ECDSA, has been reported to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that use only a single-trace. Notably, there is no perfectly secure countermeasure against Collision Attack (CA), which is the main form of attack using a single-trace. As the attacks become more and more sophisticated and powerful, such as CA, taking countermeasures against them is required. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new scalar multiplication algorithm called the T_SM method. It is secure against Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Key Bit-dependent Attack (KBA). In particular, the T_SM method can fully cope with CA. To the best of our knowledge, the T_SM method is the first countermeasure against SPA, CA, and KBA. Although it requires memory for pre-computation tables, it has a computational advantage when we apply it to cryptosystems, such as ECDSA, which use ordinary scalar multiplication based on a fixed point P and random scalar k. The main operation consists of the smallest number of operations compared with existing scalar multiplication algorithms in which P is fixed.

AB Blockchain, as a mechanism to decentralize services, security, and verifiability, offers a peer-to-peer system in which distributed nodes collaboratively affirm transaction provenance. In particular, blockchain enforces continuous storage of transaction history, secured via digital signature, and affirmed through consensus. In this study, we consider the recent surge in blockchain interest as an alternative to traditional centralized systems, and consider the emerging applications thereof. In particular, we assess the key techniques required for blockchain implementation, offering a primer to guide research practitioners. We first outline the blockchain framework in general, and then provide a detailed review of the component data and network structures. Additionally, we consider the breadth of applications to which blockchain has been applied, broadly implicating Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Cloud and Edge computing paradigms, along with many other emerging applications. Finally, we assess the various challenges to blockchain implementation for widespread practical use, considering the security vulnerabilities to majority attacks, selfish mining, and privacy leakage, as well as performance limitations of blockchain platforms in terms of scalability and availability.

AB This paper explores the contrasting notions of "permanance and disposability," "the digital and the physical," and "symbolism and function" in the context of interaction design. Drawing from diverse streams of knowledge, we describe a novel design direction for enduring computational heirlooms based on the marriage of decentralized, trustless software and durable mobile hardware. To justify this concept, we review prior research; attempt to redefine the notion of "material;" propose blockchain-based software as a particular digital material to serve as a substrate for computational heirlooms; and argue for the use of mobile artifacts, informed in terms of their materials and formgiving practices by mechanical wristwatches, as its physical embodiment and functional counterpart. This integration is meant to enable mobile and ubiquitous interactive systems for the storing, experiencing, and exchanging value throughout multiple human lifetimes; showcasing the feats of computational sciences and crafts; and enabling novel user experiences.

AB Ethereum, as the first Turing-complete blockchain platform, provides various application program interfaces for developers. Although blockchain has highly improved security, faulty configuration and usage can result in serious vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on the security vulnerabilities of the official Go-version Ethereum client (geth). The vulnerabilities are because of the insecure API design and the specific Ethereum wallet mechanism. We demonstrate attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities in an Ethereum testbed. The vulnerabilities are confirmed by the scanning results on the public Internet. Finally, corresponding countermeasures against attacks are provided to enhance the security of the Ethereum platform.

   Network Performance Collapse
AB Blockchain technology has been showing its strong performance on decentralized security when integrating with Internet of Things network. However, the trilemma of scalability-security-decentralization exists in Blockchain-based IoT. Therein the typical round-robin scheduling implemented in the Byzantine Faulty Tolerance (BFT) proposed by Neo's Blockchain has a significant delay when consecutive faulty miners exist. This paper proposes a novel analysis model for evaluating the network performance collapse in general, followed by an optimized round-robin scheduling for the case when the mutual latency difference is not significant enough for ranking. Based on the model, the optimized mechanism is able to increase the block rate for a specific subset of consecutive faulty miners by nearly 50% and provide a linearly positive growth rate of the mitigation with respect to the fail rate of a single miner, which strongly promotes the efficiency of the P2P-based BFT consensus algorithm.

AB A typical analytical lifecycle in data science projects starts with the process of data generation and collection, continues with data preparation and preprocessing and heads towards project specific analytics, visualizations and presentations. In order to ensure high quality trusted analytics, every relevant step of the data-model-result linkage needs to meet certain quality standards that furthermore should be certified by trusted quality gate mechanisms.
   We propose "blockchain-backed analytics", a scalable and easy-to-use generic approach to introduce quality gates to data science projects, backed by the immutable records of a blockchain. For that reason, data, models and results are stored as cryptographically hashed fingerprints with mutually linked transactions in a public blockchain database.
   This approach enables stakeholders of data science projects to track and trace the linkage of data, applied models and modeling results without the need of trust validation of escrow systems or any other third party.

   Blockchain; Spectrum visualization
AB The management and utilization of spectrum resources has always been an important issue. The data of radio signals from the time domain, frequency domain, and space domain is tremendous. The current spectrum databases are mainly centralized and the disaster recovery capacity of centralized database is insufficient. In the future, cognitive radio network (CRN) will be the development trend of mobile communications. The access to the spectrum database by a large number of cognitive radio (CR) terminals and the uploading of spectrum detection data by the spectrum detection terminal in real time will exert tremendous pressure on CRN. This paper proposes use of distributed spectrum databases instead of centralized database architectures in the spectrum big data to improve the fault tolerance of spectrum databases. Multi-node collaborative electromagnetic detection method with source parameter is proposed to replace the traditional wide-band energy detection method. The traditional spectrum database stores spectrum data with energy values, and the redundancy of data is really high. We propose to store the instantaneous parameters of signal source with the structure of blockchain. The timestamp is used as the link ID of the block to connect each block end-to-end, and a distributed spectrum database is established. With the timestamp as a unique identifier, the nodes locally interact with real-time detection data. Secondary user (SU) achieve the complete electromagnetic spectrum data by access each node. SUs can analyze the electromagnetic spectrum environment, and formulate appropriate strategies for rapid dynamic spectrum access (DSA).

AB Most of medical institutions only store their medical data in their own system, which brought the problem of medical data isolated island. It makes secure medical data storage, privacy protection and data share in collaborative institutions difficult tasks. A novel blockchain architecture of secure health information storage system, which is decentralized, secure and trusted, tamper-resistant, is proposed to handle those difficult tasks. The proposed model combined consortium blockchain and fully private blockchain as a hybrid blockchain to improve the delay of data validation. Furthermore, some schemes were designed to improve the performance of blockchain technology in medical data storage. By comparing the existing problems in medical information storage, we analyzed the advantages and influence of the proposed model.

AB Cloud storage is now a hot research topic in information technology, which has changed the technical architecture and implementation method of electronic record management. However, due to loss of physical control of the electronic record in cloud storage environment, it is more difficult to guarantee the consistency of record owner.
   The blockchain is a distributed decentralized ledger, in which data cannot be forged or tampered. In the paper, the consistency guarantee method of electronic record based on Blockchain is proposed. To ensure the consistency of the electronic record in the cloud storage servers, this paper replaces the skip list to store the electronic record in the blockchain with the traditional Merkle tree. Moreover, we use the hash values generated by tags and array to ensure the integrity of the tags, reduce the computation and communication cost of update and to search for the electronic record.

AB The internet has a great development, but the cyber crimes are lack of effective supervision. Furthermore, the network congestion is still a common phenomenon in our daily life. This paper proposes a decentralized web system based on blockchain to solve the above problems. In this scheme, web content publisher uploads the web contents to the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) net which is a peer to peer storage network, and gets the hashes of the web contents from IPFS system, then writes these hashes to the smart contract which has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain; thousands of web users can read the hashes of these web contents on this smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, and browse the corresponding web contents by hashes on the decentralized IPFS network. The experimental results show that the decentralized web system based on Ethereum blockchain and IPFS network can provide faster access to web contents than the traditional HTTP web. Further more, this web system has strong ability to withstand large-scale concurrent based on IPFS network which is the decentralized web content storage system without centralized web server and can fight against the malicious tampering attack based on Ethereum blockchain which can resist 51% attack and record all transactions including tampering behaviors on the Ethereum blockchain with timestamp.

DE Cloud storage; Behavior auditing; Customizable log; Blockchain
AB Cloud storage is one of the most important service of cloud computing. Since cloud service providers can not be completely trusted, traditional auditing methods can't guarantee the security of data sources. This paper proposes a security framework for cloud data audit using blockchain technology. User's operational information on the file is formed to a block after validated by all checked nodes in the blockchain network, and then to be put into the blockchain. Any modification or fake to the operational information can be inspected through the chain structure of block, thus ensuring the security of auditing data source. We construct a prototype in an Ethereum-based blockchain using Aliyun as data storage service, then test the time overhead of uploading file, broadcasting operation information and packing information into block chain. The results show that the time for packaging block remains unchanged from an overall viewpoint, and as the file size increasing, packaging block occupies less percentage in the entire process of file uploading or downloading.

DE Proxy re-encryption; Threshold secret sharing; Blockchain
AB Since the proxy re-encryption has the limitation of distributed applications and the security risk of collusion attacks in semi-trusted distributed environments (e.g. cloud computing), the novel definition of threshold proxy re-encryption is proposed based on secret sharing and proxy re-encryption. According to the definition, the threshold proxy re-encryption scheme can be flexibly created with the standard cryptographic prototype. An efficient, secure, and implementable unidirectional threshold proxy re-encryption scheme is constructed by the combination of Shamir's secret sharing, and is proved secure by using the intractability of discrete logarithms. This paper presents a consortium blockchain access permission scheme, which is built on the threshold proxy re-encryption scheme. When a new node joins a consortium blockchain, an access permission is achieved by the agreement on other existing nodes, instead of a centralized CA.

DE Blockchain; Video evidence; Trust
AB We are living in the age that crisis events happen everywhere and every day. Video evidence plays an important role in restoring the truth of the incident. The credibility of video evidence is gradually declining. On the one hand, the credibility of the government has been questioned. On the other hand, malicious attackers will distort the video and publish it on the Internet to mislead public. Inspired by the blockchain, this paper proposes a model based on blockchain to ensure the credibility of video evidence, which is called Video-Chain. VideoChain is essentially a blockchain system, but different from digital currency such as Bitcoin. It records the hash of the surveillance video. This paper takes the campus Video Surveillance as an example to describe the architecture and operation of VideoChain. We also give a consensus protocol based on the proof of stake according to the application scenario. The analysis shows that VideoChain is traceable and non-tampering, which can effectively ensure the credibility of video surveillance data. It also has good operational efficiency. This research is of great significance to enhance the trust between the government and citizens, which will improve the credibility of the government.

AB Tor hidden services have grown too rapidly so that anonymous users cannot verify the authenticity of Hidden Services. Meanwhile, there are many unsafe factors in the centralized directory management mode, and the service content and configuration can be detected and monitored by automated scripts. Faced with the above problems, this paper based on the current Tor domain name communication management model, proposed a new Hidden Service Domain Name System-HSDNS, which using SOR node decentralized management, then replace the top-level domain name as ".hs" to increase the anti-scanning property of the original domain name, introduces the PoW competition mechanism to enable registrants to get readable unique domain name among the whole network. On this basis, the random number provided by the BTC blockchain guarantees random competition and enhances the anti-registration attack, in the meantime, Merkle Tree hash detection mechanism is used to open verification service of domain authenticity, and finally verify model analysis results through the ExperimenTor simulation platform, and it shows that HSDNS model has decentralized management, service anti-scanning, domain name uniqueness and authenticity verification and so on.

AB This paper introduces a platform development and implementation method which is based on block chain to protect mobile phone privacy. It is applied to collective maintenance, programmable, safety and reliability, and the requirements of personal privacy protection. The platform consists of the manufacturer node, market node, mobile phone node and user node, which is connected by a star topology construction. All nodes include data collection module, data storage module, target detection module and data application module, which is matched by the publish/subscribe mode. Each node will match a distributed storage database for storing various transaction data. The data storage module realizes the communication between nodes and completes the building of mobile phone protection platform. This method can solve the problems such as get the usage right by flashing root, user information leakage and so on. Finally, we give the application scenario of mobile phone protection platform, aiming at realizing the privacy protection on the block chain.

DE BlockChain; Distributed systems; Decentralized features; Internet of
   things
AB BlockChain (BC) technology is the digital currency-the underlying technology of Bitcoin, which has attracted more and more attention in recent years. BC is a distributed database system with decentralized and unfalsified features that make it be expected to lead a new revolution in the technology industry. The prominent feature of BC makes it break away from currency applications and gradually enter into non-monetary applications. The distributed and anti-attack characteristics of BC technology can be well integrated into Internet of things (IoT). The existing technical features of BC enable it to realize distributed privacy and security in IoT. This paper introduces the main problems in the development of IoT and the characteristics of BC in the application of IoT. We also discusses the main direction of BC in the application of IoT. But BC can't be applied directly to IoT, and the fusion of two technologies will face many challenges. Based on these, this paper analyzes the challenges of BC in the application of IoT.

AB Under some applications, identity-authentication must be involved into block-chain systems. However, the introduction of traditional PKI mechanism in block-chain systems is not proper for 3 reasons: (1) a centralized certification authority (CA) represents a single point of failure in the network; (2) the numbers and locations of nodes vary in time; (3) it introduces additional centralized factors in the block-chain system that is already decentralized. For the sake of decentralization multi-CA scenario is considered to distribute CA-functionality to nodes. Further, armed with secret sharing scheme, a practical distributed CA-based PKI scheme is proposed that is well-associated with existed mechanisms (such as POW) in the original system. Finally, solutions of verification and multi-level assigning issues are constructed via verifiable secret sharing and multilevel secret sharing tools.

AB Nowadays, home Internet has attracted a lot of interest. Dynamic-enabled Defense Strategy can reduce the possibility of being hacked to become the mining systems for blockchain. In order to reflect the status of the smart home system more accurately, this paper proposed a method to improve the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) and make CVSS more suitable for the smart home system. The proposed method can obtain vulnerabilities scores, reflecting the security status of the system accurately and providing strong support for system security defense and reinforcement. For dynamically-enabled defense with constantly changing state, it is hard for the attacker to obtain all the information in a short time, since it requires too many resources when the changing frequency is too high. Whereas the attacker has enough time to analyze the system with low changing frequency. Combining with the improved vulnerability scoring system, we propose a dynamic-enable defense strategy based on Markov chain and stochastic Petri net to calculate the attack detection probability and the vulnerability value of the system, and obtain the best dynamic switching interval to ensure the security of the system.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects lots of smart devices around the world. As a revolutionary technology, it has been developing rapidly in recent years. This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner's authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.

DE Sharing economy; Blockchain; Blind signature; Smart contract
AB Blockchain, as the core technology of cryptocurrency, provides a novel idea for the sharing economy. A user pays the agreed money to the property owner without any trust third party in blockchain, which leads to the leakage of privacy due to openness of the blockchain. To alleviate the privacy concern, a protocol is proposed to not only protect privacy through breaking the link between the user and the property owner but also ensure the fairness among parties joined in transaction. In addition, double-spending and double-usage are detected and prevented by applying smart contract in the protocol. Compared with the existing related works, the proposed protocol is secure, effective and practical.

DE Ethereum; Smart contract; Sealed-bid auction; zk-SNARK
AB The recently growing tokenization process of digital and physical assets over the Ethereum blockchain requires a convenient trade and exchange mechanism. Sealed-bid auctions are powerful trading tools due to the advantages they offer compared to their open-cry counterparts. However, the inherent transparency and lack of privacy on the Ethereum blockchain conflict with the main objective behind the sealed-bid auctions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract protocol for a succinctly verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we utilize various cryptographic primitives including zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme, and commitment scheme for our approach. First, the proving and verification keys for zk-SNARK are generated via an MPC protocol between the auctioneer and bidders. Then, when the auction process starts, the bidders submit commitments of their bids to the smart contract. Subsequently, each bidder individually reveals her commitment to the auctioneer using the PKE scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer claims a winner and generates a proof off-chain based on the proving key, commitments which serve as public inputs, and their underlying openings which are considered the auctioneer's witness. Finally, the auctioneer submits the proof to the smart contract which in turn verifies its validity based on the public inputs, and the verification key. The proposed protocol scales efficiently as it has a constant-size proof and verification cost regardless of the number of bidders. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.

ID PROTOCOL
AB Lots of traditional applications can be redefined thanks to the benefits of Blockchain technologies. One of these services is the provision of fair certified notifications. Certified notifications is one of the applications that require a fair exchange of values: a message and a non-repudiation of origin proof in exchange for a non-repudiation of reception evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first blockchain-based certified notification system. We propose two solutions that allow sending certified notifications when confidentiality is required or when it is necessary to register the content of the notification, respectively. First, we present a protocol for Non Confidential Fair Certified Notifications that satisfies the properties of strong fairness and transferability of the proofs thanks to the use of a smart contract and without the need of a Trusted Third Party. Then, we also present a DApp for Confidential Certified Notifications with a smart contract that allows a timeliness optimistic exchange of values with a stateless Trusted Third Party.

DE Smart contracts; Turing-completeness; Blockchain; Cellular automata
AB Turing-completeness of smart contract languages in blockchain systems is often associated with a variety of language features (such as loops). On the contrary, we show that Turing-completeness of a blockchain system can be achieved through unwinding the recursive calls between multiple transactions and blocks instead of using a single one. We prove it by constructing a simple universal Turing machine using a small set of language features in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, with explicitly given relations between input and output transaction states. Neither unbounded loops nor possibly infinite validation time are needed in this approach.

AB Traditional blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin, focus on transactions in which entire amount is transferred from one owner to the other, in a single, atomic operation. This model has been re-used in the context of payment networks such as Lightning network. In this work, we propose and investigate new payment model, called split payments, in which the total amount to be transferred is split into unit-amounts and is transferred independently through the same or different routes. By splitting the payments this way, we achieve an improved total liquidity of the payment network, simplify the route advertising, reduce the amount of funds needed to be locked in the channels, and improve the privacy properties.

AB Payment channels are the most prominent solution to the blockchain scalability problem. We introduce the problem of network design with fees for payment channels from the perspective of a Payment Service Provider (PSP). Given a set of transactions, we examine the optimal graph structure and fee assignment to maximize the PSP's profit. A customer prefers to route transactions through the PSP's network if the cheapest path from sender to receiver is financially interesting, i.e., if the path costs less than the blockchain fee. When the graph structure is a tree, and the PSP facilitates all transactions, the problem can be formulated as a linear program. For a path graph, we present a polynomial time algorithm to assign optimal fees. We also show that the star network, where the center is an additional node acting as an intermediary, is a near-optimal solution to the network design problem.

AB Public Blockchains on their own are, by definition, incapable of keeping data private and disclosing it at a later time. Control over the eventual disclosure of private data must be maintained outside a Blockchain by withholding and later publishing encryption keys, for example. We propose the Atomic Information Disclosure (AID) pattern based on threshold encryption that allows a set of key holders to govern the release of data without having access to it. We motivate this pattern with problems that require independently reproduced solutions. By keeping submissions private until a deadline expires, participants are unable to plagiarise and must therefore generate their own solutions which can then be aggregated and analysed to determine a final answer. We outline the importance of a game-theoretically sound incentive scheme, possible attacks, and other future work.

AB With billions of dollars spent on blockchain, there clearly is a need to determine if this technology should be used, as demonstrated by the many proposals for decision schemes. In this work we rigorously analyze 30 existing schemes. Our analysis demonstrates contradictions between these schemes - so clearly they cannot all be right - and also highlights what we feel is a more structural flaw of most of them, namely that they ignore alternatives to blockchain-based solutions. To remedy this, we propose an improved scheme that does take alternatives into account, which we argue is more useful in practice to decide an optimal solution for a particular use case.

AB Proof-of-work (PoW) is used as the consensus mechanism in most cryptocurrencies. PoW-based puzzles play an important part in the operation and security of a cryptocurrency, but come at a considerable energy cost. One approach to the problem of energy wastage is to find ways to build PoW schemes from valuable computational problems. This work proposes calibration of public key cryptographic systems as a suitable source of PoW puzzles. We describe the properties needed to adapt public key cryptosystems as PoW functions suitable for decentralised cryptocurrencies and provide a candidate example.

DE Economic modeling; Performance; Cryptocurrencies
AB Abrupt changes in the miner hash rate applied to a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at least a day, with a peak delay of 100%.

DE Coloured coins; Privacy; Confidential ring signature; Commitments
AB Privacy in block-chains is considered second to functionality, but a vital requirement for many new applications, e.g., in the industrial environment. We propose a novel transaction type, which enables privacy preserving trading of independent assets on a common block-chain. This is achieved by extending the ring confidential transaction with an additional commitment to a colour and a publicly verifiable proof of conservation. With our coloured confidential ring signatures, new token types can be introduced and transferred by any participant using the same sized anonymity set as single-token privacy aware block-chains. Thereby, our system facilitates tracking assets on an immutable ledger without compromising the confidentiality of transactions.

AB In the upcoming evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is anticipated that billions of devices will be connected to the Internet. Many of these devices are capable of collecting information from individual users and their physical surroundings. They are also capable of taking smart actions, which are usually from a backend cloud server in the IoT system. While IoT promises a more connected and smarter world, this pervasive large-scale data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis raise many privacy concerns.
   In the current IoT ecosystem, IoT service providers have full control of the collected user data. While the original intended use of such data is primarily for smart IoT system and device control, the data is often used for other purposes not explicitly consented to by the users. We propose a novel user privacy protection framework, PrivacyGuard, that aims to empower users with full privacy control of their data. PrivacyGuard framework seamlessly integrates two new technologies, blockchain and trusted execution environment (TEE). By encoding data access policy and usage as smart contracts, PrivacyGuard can allow data owners to control who can have what access to their data, and be able to maintain a trustworthy record of their data usage. Using remote attestation and TEE, PrivacyGuard ensures that data is only used for the intended purposes approved by the data owner. Our approach represents a significant departure from traditional privacy protections which often rely on cryptography and pure software-based secure computation techniques. Addressing the fundamental problem of data usage control, PrivacyGuard will become the cornerstone for free market of private information.

AB One of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology is the consensus protocol. Most of the current consensus protocols are PoW (Proof of Work) based, or fixed-validators based. Nevertheless, PoW requires massive computational effort, which results in high energy and computing resources consumption. Alternatively, fixed-validators protocols rely on fixed, static validators responsible for validating all newly proposed blocks, which opens the door for adversaries to launch several attacks on these validators such as DDoS and eclipse attacks. In this paper, we propose a truly decentralized consensus protocol that does not require PoW and randomly employs a different set of different size of validators on each block's proposal. Additionally, our protocol utilizes a game theoretical model to enforce the honest validators' behavior by rewarding honest validators and penalizing dishonest ones. We have analyzed our protocol and shown that it mitigates various attacks that current protocols suffer from.

AB We introduce our solution developed for data privacy, and specifically for cognitive security that can be enforced and guaranteed using blockchain technology in SAAL (Smart Ambient Assisted Living) environments. Using our proposal the access to a patient's clinical process resists tampering and ransomware attacks that have recently plagued the HIS (Hospital Information Systems) in various countries. One important side effect of this data infrastructure is that it can be accessed in open form, for research purposes for instance, since no individual re-identification or group profiling is possible by any means.

However, in such electronic voting systems, the public bulletin board that is hosted by the third party for publishing and auditing the voting results should be trusted by all participants. Recently a number of blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to address this issue. However, these systems are impractical to use due to the limitations on the voter and candidate numbers supported, and their security framework, which highly depends on the underlying blockchain protocol and suffers from potential attacks (e.g., force-abstention attacks). To deal with two aforementioned issues, we propose a practical platform-independent secure and verifiable voting system that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports an execution of a smart contract. Verifiability is inherently provided by the underlying blockchain platform, whereas cryptographic techniques like Paillier encryption, proof-of-knowledge, and linkable ring signature are employed to provide a framework for system security and user-privacy that are independent from the security and privacy features of the blockchain platform. We analyse the correctness and coercion-resistance of our proposed voting system. We employ Hyperledger Fabric to deploy our voting system and analyse the performance of our deployed scheme numerically.

ID SECURITY MODELS; CONSTRUCTION
AB Ring signature is a variant of digital signature, which makes any member in a group generate signatures representing this group with anonymity and unforgeability. In recent years, ring signatures have been employed as a kind of anonymity technology in the blockchain-based cryptocurrency such as Monero. Recently Malavolta et al. introduced a novel ring signature protocol that has anonymity and unforgeability in the standard model [33]. Their construction paradigm is based on non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments of knowledge and re-randomizable keys.
   In this work, for the purpose of lower bandwidth cost in blockchain, we improve their ring signature by proposing a compact NIZK argument of knowledge. We show our NIZK holds under a new complexity assumption Compact Linear Knowledge of Exponent Assumption. Without the expense of security, our proposed ring signature scheme is anonymous and unforgeable in the standard model. It saves almost half of storage space of signature, and reduces almost half of pairing computations in verification process. When the ring size is large, the effect of our improvements is obvious.

AB We study key leakage in the context of cryptocurrencies. First, we consider the problem of explicit key leakage occurring on opensource intelligence platforms. To do this, we monitor the Pastebin feed from Sep 2017-Mar 2018 to find exposed secret Bitcoin keys, revealing that attackers could have stolen 22.40 BTC worth roughly $178,000 given current exchange rates. Then, we focus on implicit key leakage by exploiting the wrong usage of cryptographic primitives and scan Bitcoin's blockchain for ECDSA nonce reuse. We systematically outline how an attacker can use duplicate r values to leak nonces and secret keys, which goes beyond the simple case where the same nonce and the same key have been used in conjunction more than once. Our results show that ECDSA nonce reuse has been a recurring problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem and has already been exploited by attackers. In fact, an attacker could have exploited nonce reuse to steal 412.80 BTC worth roughly $3.3 million.

AB One of the biggest challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) is to bridge the currently fragmented trust domains. The traditional PKI model relies on a common root of trust and does not fit well with the heterogeneous IoT ecosystem where constrained devices belong to independent administrative domains.
   In this work we describe a distributed trust model for the IoT that leverages the existing trust domains and bridges them to create end-to-end trust between IoT devices without relying on any common root of trust. Furthermore we define a new cryptographic primitive, denoted as obligation chain designed as a credit-based Blockchain with a built-in reputation mechanism. Its innovative design enables a wide range of use cases and business models that are simply not possible with current Blockchain-based solutions while not experiencing traditional blockchain delays. We provide a security analysis for both the obligation chain and the overall architecture and provide experimental tests that show its viability and quality.

DE SLA score; AS ranking; blockchain
AB We tackle the problem of enabling Autonomous Systems to evaluate network providers on the basis of their adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) regarding interconnection agreements. In current Internet practices, choices of interconnection partners are driven by factors such as word of mouth, personal relationships, brand recognition and market intelligence, and not by proofs of previous performance. Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimentary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore.
   Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently-emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements. We propose the concept of SLA score to evaluate network providers and introduce a privacy-preserving protocol that allows networks to compute and verify SLA scores.

AB In the recent years, there has been a boom in the number of connected devices due to developments in the field of Internet of things. This has also increased the requirements of security specification. The proposed method is introducing a secure information transmission system by using Blockchain technology. Blockchain is a relatively new technology which was introduced by stoshi nakamoto, which was also the basis for developing crypto currency [bitcoin]. Crypto currencies are made transparent and secure using their network architecture, which is a combo of a decentralized and distributed network. In this paper is try to exploit the same methodology used in crypto currencies to develope an IOT network, where the devices can talk to their peers in a secure manner. They explored all the different networks and features of developing a Decentralized application that is named as Dapp.

   response code
AB As technology develops, there arises a need to take control of personal data. One of the most important benefits of block chain is that, it can store data permanently and in an immutable manner. And another one aspect is that block chain is decentralized i,e there is no central hub to store data. Using this technology to store important documents of an individual makes the documents more secured and they cannot be tampered once uploaded and the individual can have the advantage of accessing their documents anytime without the need of middle men. Smart contracts are used to exchange data in a transparent and in a trusted manner. Documents of the users are converted into e-docs along with a unique quick response code. Each individual's code forms a block with a specific hashed value and helps in forming a continuous blocks. These blocks cannot be altered once formed and hence it is not possible to retrieve the documents unless the user's permission. It is secured using the user's fingerprint which is dissolved into text using steganography. Thus the documents are kept secure and can be used whenever needed without any constraints and can also be never tampered or manipulated

DE Blockchain; data storage; database; decentralization; single points of
   failure
AB It's has been years and we still have a lot of downtimes in the major online platforms we use. When we go deep down and understand the problem, it's all because of SPOF i.e. Single point of failure (which is a part of a system that, if it fails, it will stop the entire system from working). By this there is a possibility of downtime or hack or tampering of data or loss of data. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain, then a lot of communities like Ethereum, etc. have been developing dApp protocols and frameworks to build applications in blockchain. Also a world renowned framework called Hyperledger Project is also in development made by an open source community consisting of people from large organisations. Early days and also now we have been using a technology called Torrent which is also decentralized. And now the question why to use decentralized systems in regards of issues with the largest social media company the problem was with the data that it had stored. Imagine a network that gives you the full control and privacy of data you share, send and get. Also not having a single second of service unavailability. The main aim of the project is to build a database system to achieve the goal of decentralized internet.

This paper will draw clarity over the transaction by blockchain system and methods. The focus of paper contemplates the different association with the transaction, and concludes towards the high relished transaction system and functioning of the complete working and levelled system. The blockchain is another layer to run the existing stack of the Internet protocols, adding a new entire table of the given protocols and generated consensus by other user or participants. The advanced data isn't duplicated however is disseminated in various blocks and when the block consolidates they frame blockchain. In this day and age, the blockchain innovation is considered as the most secure path for exchanges.

AB We present an application of Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts to the management of Agile projects, using Scrum or Lean-Kanban processes. In our application the duties of the Product Owner for certifying the correctness of the outcomes are delegated to one or more Smart Contracts deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain and written in Solidity. An agreement with the Customer can also allow the Smart Contracts to automatically enable payments, to introduce penalties or grants on the basis of the outcome. Product Owner duties and work can thus be relieved allowing to allocate resources on more profitable and productive tasks. Other possibilities are examined as well.

AB The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. Firstly, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Secondly, a reputation based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (DBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Furthermore, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs from energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

AB Diabetes is one of the most common disease over the world which requires a daily self-care in order to be controlled. Nowadays, diabetes self-management can benefit from the recent advanced technologies such as Internet of things (wearables and medical sensors) to take measurements and track health data. In this paper, we present a platform architecture based on the IoT and Blockchain to facilitate the follow-up of diabetes and to help patients to self-manage it properly. Our architecture combines the IoT with the Blockchain technology in order to collect patients' data, share it with their healthcare teams in a near real-time and in a secure manner while preserving patient's privacy.

AB The main advantage of Blockchain technology is the immutability of data maintained by decentralized systems. Earlier studies introduce the probability of attackers succeeding in modifying legitimate data in the blocks. We propose "immutability measure", a metric that indicates the degree of difficulty in modifying existing data in Blockchain. We propose different blockchain structures that can be more appropriate for different applications. There are several parameters that determine the difficulty of modifying data in Blockchain. We analyze the impact of each of these parameters on the immutability measure of various blockchain structures. We also study the required computational and electrical power as well as the time for a successful attack in various blockchain structures. We demonstrate that our proposed blockchain structures can exponentially improve the immutability measure with a nominal increase in computing resources.

AB The main utility of blockchain networks stem from their ability to offer a trusted platform for execution of processes. The default blockchain implementation, where an immutable log of all transactions is maintained by every participant, is i) inefficient, and ii) does not scale well. This paper outlines several strategies to improve the scope and scale of processes that can be executed in a blockchain.

AB Current off-the-shelf Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Flight Data Recorders do not address liability and accountability in the event of an accident. This limitation makes it difficult for necessary stakeholders to determine parties at fault, especially when future operations are expected to be conducted Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLoS). While both on-board and off-board recorders currently exist, the data collected is unsuitable for insurance claims and other legal matters since non-repudiation and tamper-proof mechanisms are not implemented. At the same time, with ongoing developments and improvements to Internet of Things (IoT) telecommunications infrastructure such as LTE-M, 5G, SigFox and NB-IoT protocols, usage of TCP/IP channels and cloud services for UAV Command and Control systems is increasing. This research proposes a real-time, off-board flight logging service using a secure graph database scheme for storage and analysis of flight data recordings. By representing series of logs as an encrypted block chain in graph nodes of a database, it is possible to construct accurate time-lines and enable non-repudiation of operator-UAV and UAV-UAV interactions that provide irrefutable evidence. For proof of concept, this design integrates into the UAV as a Service architecture for BVLOS operations we have proposed in previous publications. The details of the recording protocol, integration into the UAV as a Service platform, data generation simulation and performance results are discussed.

AB The blockchain is a state of the art technology which is directly associated with the process of mining cryptocurrencies. However, this technology can be practically applied in many areas of the national economy, including oil and gas industry. For example, the blockchain can be useful in solving problems related to the confirming the integrity of primary geological and geophysical data during remote monitoring of the well construction process by excluding the influence of human factor. This technology is referred to as the industrial blockchain and requires consistent encryption and data distribution on storage locations in peer-to-peer network. Any modification of the primary geological and geophysical data in the blockchain system, on any of the computers/equipment in any block, will automatically detected by all participants of the blockchain network. The system of ensuring the integrity and invariability of the received and transmitted data will work as long as at least a single of the network is operated. Hacking such a system is not feasible and cost-effective because the potential attackers have to break through every block, as well as copies of the database on every computer and equipment in the network. This requires a potential attacker to have unique computing resources, which is currently not available. In practice, the reliability of blockchain platforms is confirmed by many years of experience in the bitcoin mining system based on the blockchain principles. The implementation of the blockchain platform in the oil and gas service allowed to ensure and guarantee the reliability of primary geological and geophysical data obtained from wells in real time, to reduce the risks of unauthorized changes. The reliability of the primary data reduces the risks of erroneous management decisions, made by the processing and analysis of these primary well data.

AB The rising digital publishing industry highlights the current problems of digital copyright protection, such as "difficult to confirm rights, difficult to make profits and difficult to protect rights". Admittedly, block chain technology integrates several core technical advantages and has been gradually put into practice in finance, notarization, voting and other fields. However in fact, block chain still has many technical problems which need to be further solved. In this paper, block chain technology and smart contract are introduced into the digital works copyright management. The copyright information storage protocol of this model is based on block chain, which ensures that copyright information can not be tampered falsified. Copyright control agreement based on smart contract, automatic execution and non-interference mechanism ensure the efficient and transparent operation of the model. This model provides copyright registration and copyright query for digital works on the Internet.

AB With the rapid development of information technology, blockchain, big data and cloud computing has gradually been emerging from lab experiments to real world applications. When implementing blockchain technology, international trade is performing much better in terms of transparency, security, cost reduction and efficiency when compared with traditional trade mode. Based on the discussion of concept and features of blockchain technology, this paper analyses the main areas in international trade where blockchain technology could be implemented, such as international cargo transportation, cross -border payment and liquidation, trade financing, letter of credit, product traceability, and international trade supply chain. A good start has been noted with the application of blockchain technology in international trade. Although still with defects and shortcomings, blockchain technology is still believed to bring international trade with ecological innovation and model innovation.

AB Popularly known for powering cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchains is seen as a disruptive technology capable of impacting a wide variety of domains, ranging from finance to governance, by offering superior security, reliability, and transparency in a decentralized manner. In this tutorial presentation, we first study the original Bitcoin design, as well as Ethereum and Hyperledger, and reflect on their design from an academic perspective. We provide an overview of potential applications and associated research challenges, as well as a survey of ongoing research projects. We mention opportunities blockchain creates for event-based systems. Finally, we conclude with a walkthrough showing the process of developing a decentralized application (DApp), using a popular Smart Contract language (Solidity) for the blockchain platform of Ethereum.

DE Blockchain; Distributed Ledger; Service Discovery
AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform released to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, financial transactions, asset management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid.
   Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the first tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (chaincode) and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic.
   However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically configured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more difficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the design and implementation of Service Discovery.
   Service Discovery provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain applications.

AB The recent success of electric vehicles leads to unprecedentedly high peaks of demand on the electric grid at the times when most people charge their cars. In order to avoid unreasonably rising costs due to inefficient utilization of the electricity infrastructure, we propose EVA: a scheduling system to solve the valley filling problem by distributing the electricity demand generated by electric vehicles in a geographically limited area efficiently over time spans in which the electric grid is underutilized. EVA is based on a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain in combination with off-chain computational nodes performing the schedule calculation using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This allows for a high degree of transparency and verifiability in the scheduling computation results while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency. In order to interact with the scheduling system, we developed a decentralized app with a graphical frontend, where the user can enter vehicle information and future energy requirements as well as review upcoming schedules. The calculation of the schedule is performed on a daily basis, continuously providing schedules for participating users for the following day.

AB This paper describes the proof of concept of a blockchain based organization of a local low voltage energy community. The focus of the concept is efficient use of shared resources to minimize external dependence, and not energy trading. A previously proposed control algorithm, which exploits the power dependency of the efficiency of electrical energy storages, is implemented as a smart contract on a private instance of an Ethereum blockchain to coordinate the operation. It is implemented using four connected Raspberry Pis representing the participating households with pre-given electrical load and photovoltaic conversion as well as a battery. Each household runs an Ethereum full node and an interfacing software. Only the energy technology components are simulated, while the blockchain is actually running on the Raspberry Pis in order to mind the full complexity of the technology. The practicability is proved in a test run and positive effects on the efficiency and the self-sufficiency within the community are observed. A first cost-benefit estimate is given and a further research agenda is presented.

AB Despite the very high volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, the interest in the development and adaptation of existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as well as new distributed ledger technologies is increasing. Therefore, understanding the security and vulnerability issues of such blockchain systems plays a critical role. In this work, we propose a configurable distributed simulation framework for analyzing Bitcoin-like blockchain systems which are based on Proof-of-Work protocols. The simulator facilitates investigating security properties of blockchain systems by enabling users to configure several characteristics of the blockchain network and executing different attack scenarios, such as double-spending attacks and flood attacks and observing the effects of the attacks on the blockchain network.

AB Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) such as IOTA Tangle has been proposed to address the inefficiencies of traditional blockchains, including the issues with scalability, high resource consumptions, and the increasing transaction fees. Despite the promising features introduced by IOTA, the properties of DAG-based distributed ledgers are not yet comprehensively studied. In this work, we propose CIDDS, a configurable and interactive DAG-based DLT simulation framework. CIDDS enables the user to perform large-scale simulations with thousands of nodes and to investigate different characteristics of the network under controlled conditions.

AB Cryptocurrencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies, such as Ethereum have received extensive attention over the past few years. With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, comprehensive understanding of its various properties plays a critical role in the widespread adaptation. However, due to the significant requirements for deploying a full Ethereum blockchain and high running costs, it is challenging to study the dynamic properties of the Ethereum. In this work, we propose eVIBES, a configurable simulation framework for gaining empirical insights into the dynamic properties of Ethereum.

AB Blockchain technology has been evolved in the last years and its area of utilization has been increased, also. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between organizations using the above mentioned technology and value, to identify the general and specific sources of value, respectively. The evaluation of value perceptions is a long-term research while the blockchain-based projects are very recent. Therefore, the value creation and value added concepts are very helpful for start-ups, entrepreneurs as well as stakeholders. Considering the untraditional management of such organization the paper presents the traditional approach of value- created and added and adapts them in the area of information technology through the specific instrument of these businesses- smart contract. Also, how other aspects like decentralized management or virtual coin could develop value for business are discussed. The outcome is that the paper offers some conclusions which could be helpful for investors but, more important for those who want to develop projects using this new technology.

AB The application of mu MPMU in the fault diagnosis of distribution network is increasingly widespread. In addition to the waveform data of the mu MPMUs near the fault point, some existing fault diagnosis algorithms require the waveform of mu MPMU at other locations. However, the mu MPMU measurement signal far from the fault location may not reach the trigger recording condition. Aiming at the difficulty of cooperative fault recording of mu MPMU, this paper proposes a new collaborative trigger recording scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, every mu MPMU acts as a node and a blockchain network is constructed. The smart contract is used to stipulate the rule of coordinated trigger recording. The mu MPMUs that spontaneously start the recording inform others to perform coordinated fault recording, and the waveform data are stored in a blockchain structure for the master station summoning. In this paper, the pros and cons of the blockchain-based scheme and the existing master station based coordinated fault recording scheme are analyzed, which provides a new research approach for the coordinated start-up of mu MPMU fault recording in the distribution network.

AB Era of digitalisation introduced new art of fast growing virtual currencies known as cryptocurrencies. To date November 2018, some 2100 cryptocurrencies are listed on renowned portal CoinMarketCap, growing at high pace of 100-200 new increments per month. Many global financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank believe that the invention of Bitcoin and Blockchain has the most disruptive potential since invention of the Internet. But where are other potential areas of cryptos and what are the chances to supplement fiat currencies? This paper synthetises the satus-quo on Bitcoin knowledge while analysing selected monetary aspects such as role and value of money, impact of regulatory constraints, necessity of political sponsorship but also it's volatile market dynamics and speculative nature of investors. In this paper, we present a professional point of view that covers the security and privacy of people and property aspects of Bitcoin.

DE Blockchain Technology; Internet; Marketing; Decentralization
AB Under the background of Internet +, the application of enterprise marketing based on blockchain technology is infinite in the future. Through the sharing of consumer data among enterprises, user segmentation and target consumer images become clearer, making it possible to achieve precision marketing. The blockchain technology provides an effective way for consumers to verify the authenticity of products. Enterprises can also enhance customer experience and brand trust and reduce consumption risk. Besides, the business credit system based on blockchain technology makes the transactions among B2B, B2C, and C2C more secure and reliable and promotes the establishment and development of personal credit, corporate social responsibility marketing, and social honesty. At the same time, as a new product of economic development, the application of blockchain technology is still at risk. On the one hand, the risk exists in blockchain technology itself, that is, the breakthrough of new technology may lead to the loss of efficiency of original technologies and the reduction of security, which will make the data be exposed to the possibility of leakage. On the other hand, it comes from the moral hazards of the people who use the technology. If all the people involved in verifying the information admit the "authenticity" of false data, the whole chain will fall into a false trap. The core idea of the block chain is decentralization, but the profit-driven information possession has made the organizations that are already in data oligopoly to realize the complete monopoly of data by establishing the status of main chain and attracting regional links in other fields. It is contrary to the core idea of decentralization of the block chain. This paper analyzes the influence of the blockchain technology on enterprise marketing and the risks of blockchain technology, as a new product of economic development from the perspective of technology, morality and centralization.

AB Recently, Blockchain is considered as one of the main powerful techniques in security and privacy domains. It is considered as the promised security concept for replacing the current third parities trusting solutions. This could be achieved by mixing some cryptography techniques, consensus algorithms alongside with some peer-to-peer communication protocols. In this paper, to meet the requirement of distributed structure in the eHealth Records (EHRs) system, we propose a novel protocol to achieve a perfect privacy preserving for the patient namely Pseudonym Based Encryption with Different Authorities (PBE-DA) by applying the concept of Blockchain on the healthcare communication entities in an e-health platform. Therefore, PBE-DA will be used to help the patient anonymously to access, check or update his sensitive data on EHRs system. Moreover, we analyzed not only the public blockchain tier between the different EHRs cloud provider but also another Blockchain tier between the patient sensors (IoT devices used to do some patient measurements) and the patient system as a gateway for the whole healthcare platform.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems, and/or other connected devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT data collected from different sensors, nodes and collectors are transferred to the cloud over the internee IoT devices are used by consumers, healthcare, businesses as well as by the governments. It is being forecast that 31 billion IoT devices will be deployed all over the world by the year 2020. As the use of IoT devices is increasing every moment several IoT vulnerabilities are introduced. The results and analysis indicate that massive deployment of IoT with an integration of new technologies are introducing new security challenges in IoT paradigm. In this paper, IoT security challenges and open issues are discussed which provides a ground for future research. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging technologies like Deep Learning based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architectures, Block Chain, Artificial Intelligence, new computer-human interfaces and interactions based on Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, Autonomous Software, etc. are creating new opportunities to transform classic e-learning systems through innovation. This paper presents a modern e-learning project intended to re- architecture an Image Processing e-learning system using Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Service solutions. Facerecognition applications and computer vision applications such as self-driving vehicles which rely heavily on Convolutional Neural Networks can be seamlessly and easily build from scratch, or use a pre-trained model with a very large particular dataset. Cloud Storage Service proved to be the ultimate solution for this e-learning system re-architecture.

AB The proposed paper presents a literature review regarding the status of integrating the dynamic blockchain technology in the educational field. Blockchain is a relatively new technology and the same is its implementations in education. The emerging need in this area of research, which still is in its infancy, is justified by the possible use cases; some of these cases are in piloting phase, while others have already been adopted by educational institutions. This paper focuses on extending knowledge about blockchain and on identifying the benefits, risks and the associated challenges regarding the successful implementation of blockchain-based solutions in the field of education, fully in line with standards and guidelines for quality assurance.

ID SECURITY
AB This paper discusses the application of the blockchain technology to wireless communications, in particular, for enhancing the security of vehicular communications. The idea that the blockchain will become a key solution for ensuring security and data consistency has long been controversial, even in more traditional areas such as finance or real-estate, for example. In this paper, an analysis of the two opposing sides is put forward and a review of the key aspects that need further evolution to ensure the blockchain's survival is presented. In the context of vehicular communications existing blockchain applications are examined with focus on certificate and reputation management, and message forwarding promotion. In this scope, the future of the blockchain is debated with emphasis on the key limitations of public implementations.

AB Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) show many potential benefits to the way we travel today. The security requirements to be matched in this kind of systems are challenging and they show technical, societal, legal, and economical concerns (e.g. anonymity, accountability, non-repudiation). To address security, standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2, ETSI) and harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC)) have proposed a Certification Authority-based (CA-based) Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) which still suffers of Single Point of Failure (SPoF) locate in CAs and does not provide transparency in the certificate issuance.
   We propose IOTA-VPKI, a Distributed Ledger Technology based (DLT-based) VPKI that improve the state-of-the-art eliminating SPoF with seamless scalability with respect to the users. IOTA-VPKI also guarantees transparency in the issuance of certificates as well as historical proof-of-possession by storing signed and hashed certificates on the IOTA ledger to facilitate verification procedure. The use of IOTA DLT assure also the feasible deploy in Internet of Things (IoT) domain, where the devices involved have limited computational resources. The effectiveness of our DLT-based VPKI will be measured in testbed for EU Horizon 2020-funded AUTOmated driving Progressed by Internet Of Things (AUTOPILOT) project.

AB Selfish nodes can collapse autonomous distributed network systems, such as ad hoc network systems or peer-to-peer network systems. In our previous work [1], [2], we proposed an autonomous distributed collaborative messaging system model utilizing blockchain technology. An intermediate node obtains tokens of sending a message like a postage stamp if the node relays a message which is not from the node neither to the node. We revealed that communication by multiple relaying nodes can be executed, and selfish node cannot commit fraud. In this paper, we evaluate our proposed method to reveal its effectiveness.

   Clustering
AB Blockchain technology which is the fundamental system of Bitcoin running on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, has attracted a lot of attention. This enables a practical P2P electronic money system with Byzantine fault tolerance and stability with all participating nodes having the same transaction ledger and using a distributed consensus algorithm called Proof of Work (PoW) that performs calculation work called mining. Many studies have proposed methods of enhancing scalability in terms of transaction processing of blockchain, however few studies have proposed them in term of network load in a P2P network architecture. To solve these problems, we propose a method in which all nodes are separated into mining nodes in a pure P2P network and blockchain data having nodes in a distributed hash table (DHT) network. Kademlia is incorporated as DHT network for processing responsible blocks' data for each node cluster and broadcasting efficiently. The results of a broadcast simulation show that our method improved the redundancy rate and average number of messages in the networks.

DE PGP; Pretty Good Privacy; Blockchain; Ethereum; Key server; PKI; Public
   key infrastructure
AB Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is one of the most prominent cryptographic standards offering end-to-end encryption for email messages and other sensitive information. PGP allows to verify the identity of the correspondent in information exchange as well as the information integrity. PGP implements asymmetric encryption with certificates shared through a network of PGP key servers. Many recent breaches show that certificate infrastructure can be compromised as well as exposed to operational errors. In this paper we propose a new PGP management framework with the key server infrastructure implemented using blockchain technology. Our framework resolves some problems of PGP key servers focusing in particular on fast propagation of certificate revocation among key servers and elimination of man-in-the-middle risk. We also provided user access right control where only the certificate holder can change information related to the certificate. We designed and developed a prototype for key server deployment on permissioned Ethereum blockchain. Permissioned blockchain should allow to control the costs of PGP key server infrastructure maintenance at the present level.

AB Blockchain can be the base for an evolution in several digital services. Fair Certified Notification is one of these and requires a fair exchange of values: a message and a non-repudiation of origin proof in exchange for a non-repudiation of reception evidence. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a blockchain-based Multiparty Fair Certified Notification system allowing the simultaneous fair notification to a set of receivers. We present and evaluate a smart contract for an optimistic multiparty protocol that achieves the properties of confidentiality, fairness and timeliness with a stateless TTP.

DE Swarm robotics; P2P; Blockchain
AB Swarm robotics is a research field in which a group of autonomous robots execute tasks through cooperative works. Sharing information among robots is a central function for an optimal performance of the system. Given that the swarm network structure constantly changes when robots move, it becomes difficult to guarantee on information sharing by all swarm members. We, in this work, propose an approach for information sharing on swarm robotic systems by using Blockchain technology. A function of distributed ledger in Blockchain technology has possibility to solve the information sharing problem and to easily synchronize their state. However, because Blockchain persistently keeps past transactions, the increase of its chain size is one of the serious issues to manage Blockchain technology. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to share information among autonomous robots and demonstrate through experiments that how the differences in data size recorded in the blockchain affect the chain size. As a result, compared with our previous approach, we succeeded in suppressing increase in chain size by using the proposal approach; it was reduced the amount of increase in chain size about 73.0% when each node repeatedly shared about 2.8KB image data by 100 times.

AB Establishing a root-of-trust is a key early step in establishing trust throughout the lifecycle of a device, notably by attesting the running software. A key technique is to use hardware security in the form of specialised modules or hardware functions such as TPMs. However, even if a device supports such features, other steps exist that can compromise the overall trust model between devices being manufactured until decommissioning. In this paper, we discuss how blockchains, and smart contracts in particular, can be used to harden the overall security management both in the case of existing hardware enhanced security or when only software attestation is possible.

DE Blockchain; Smart contract; Patterns
AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables new forms of decentralized software architectures, where distributed components can reach agreements on shared system states without trusting a central integration point. Blockchain provides a shared infrastructure to execute programs, called smart contracts, and to store data. Since blockchain technologies are at an early stage, there is a lack of a systematic and holistic view on designing software systems that use blockchain. We view blockchain as part of a bigger system, which requires patterns for using blockchain in the design of their software architecture. In this paper, we collect a list of patterns for blockchain-based applications. The pattern collection is categorized into four types, including interaction with external world patterns, data management patterns, security patterns and contract structural patterns. Some patterns are designed considering the nature of blockchain and how it can be specifically introduced within real-world applications. Others are variants of existing design patterns applied in the context of blockchain-based applications and smart contracts.

DE Permissioned Blockchain Systems; Hyperledger Fabric; Resource Fairness;
   Prioritization; Weighted Fair Queueing
AB In this paper, we consider the problem of fair scheduling of transactions of multiple types that are submitted to a permissioned blockchain system. Permissioned blockchains are being increasingly used for enterprise applications and by design are heterogeneous in nature, with different peer organizations performing different business functions. Transactions execute different smart contract operations that may have widely varying business importance. In such a setting, we argue that the typically adopted First-In-First-Out ordering mechanism for transactions in a blockchain system, which is a performance-limited resource, is inefficient and unfair. We propose a weighted fair queueing strategy for ordering transactions that can support differentiated quality of service for submitted transactions on the blockchain. The main challenge we address in this paper is to support fair allocation and differentiation in a decentralized manner, as there is no single authority that can facilitate this as in traditional systems. We demonstrate such a fair scheduling strategy and support multiple transaction types with different priorities on Hyperledger Fabric.

AB This paper introduces BcWAN, a roaming solution for an IoT LoRa-based network that allows IoT end-devices to deliver data to their home network going through foreign 1 gateways.
   Our architecture removes the central core network and replaces it with a blockchain that handles the network access control. Any gateway in the system can communicate directly with another gateway in a peer-to-peer manner while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and soundness. Our work solves the fair exchange problem introduced in such architecture where no third party is involved thanks to a combination of encryption and specific blockchain techniques like custom script operators. We implement a proof of concept of the BcWAN architecture to gather an insight of the performance of the solution. We outline that BcWAN itself does not add any significant overhead to a near real-time IoT application by presenting preliminary test results.

DE trust; privacy; blockchain; cloud security
AB In 2038 we have lived though a decade during which the world's global computational infrastructure undermined privacy and trust in virtually every aspect of our lives. The problems were seen far in advance, but it was commonplace belief that a combination of cryptography and more distributed responsibilty in systems-blockchains for everything, and all hail the cloud'-would together restore what had been lost in the first decades of the 21st century. As it turned out, it was these very technologies that ended up destroying the privacy and trust we had left.
   In this review, we argue that the mistake collectively made was to think of privacy and trust as technological problems, when in fact they are properties of social and political systems. If we are to recover from what we call the BlockCloud Apocalypse, humans and machines are going to have to figure out how to build systems that support privacy and trust in society, rather than attempt to replace it with trust in technical validations. We propose a return to trust in humanitarian motives rather than technological supremacy.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way in which we do a number of things including in-home medical care. An in-home care system that uses IoT technology offers a number of benefits; it enables remote monitoring by the caregivers and the physicians, empowers the patient, allowing them to be more independent, offers loved ones peace of mind and reduces costs. This paper through a literature study explores possibilities for the architectural design of an in-home medical care system (IHMCS) that integrates smart devices used for the monitoring of the vitals of a patient. This work proposes using the microservices architectural style and Blockchain technology for the architectural design of the in-home care system. In support of this work, a preliminary proof of concept explores this theoretical framework.

DE value exchange; Blockchain; cross-chain communication
AB Blockchain is distributed ledger with the advantage of high security, tamper resistant and traceability. However, in the process of the growth of Blockchain, network isolation hinders the cooperative operation among different Blockchains and greatly restricts the development of Blockchain. There is an urgent need to break the barriers among Blockchains[1], thus cross-chain communication become a new trend of the Blockchain technology[2]. In this paper, we propose CVEM, a value exchange mechanism which supports different kind of tokens transfer cross-chain. First, we put the main exchange process execute off-chain and the final result on-chain. Then, we combine Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract (RSMC) with the idea of cross-token exchange of Blockchain, and use the mechanism of multi-signatures address to constrain the users' behaviors. In addition, we introduce the Simple Payment Verification Proof (SPV Proof) to verify transactions. Our work, to some degree, shortens the transaction process delay and also ensures the security and scalability of the value exchange.

DE Blockchain; cryptocurrencies; social good
AB The rise of blockchain technologies has given a boost to social good projects, which are trying to exploit various characteristic features of blockchains: the quick and inexpensive transfer of cryptocurrency, the transparency of transactions, the ability to tokenize any kind of assets, and the increase in trustworthiness due to decentralization. However, the swift pace of innovation in blockchain technologies, and the hype that has surrounded their "disruptive potential", make it difficult to understand whether these technologies are applied correctly, and what one should expect when trying to apply them to social good projects. This paper addresses these issues, by systematically analysing a collection of 120 blockchain-enabled social good projects. Focussing on measurable and objective aspects, we try to answer various relevant questions: which features of blockchains are most commonly used? Do projects have success in fund raising? Are they making appropriate choices on the blockchain architecture? How many projects are released to the public, and how many are eventually abandoned?

DE Aggregate Programming; Blockchain; Security; Byzantine fault tolerance
ID SERVICES
AB Aggregate Computing is a promising paradigm for coordinating large numbers of possibly situated devices, typical of scenarios related to the Internet of Things, smart cities, drone coordination, and mass urban events. Currently, little work has been devoted to study and improve security in aggregate programs, and existing works focus solely on application-level countermeasures. Those security systems work under the assumption that the underlying computational model is respected; however, so-called Byzantine behaviour violates such assumption. In this paper, we discuss how Byzantine behaviours can hinder an aggregate program, and exploit application-level protection for creating bigger disruption. We discuss how the blockchain technology can mitigate these attacks by enforcing behaviours consistent with the expected operational semantics, with no impact on the application logic.

AB IoT utilization in daily lives is very potential and can be applied in various fields, unfortunately the implementation in the social field still lacking. The large number of orphanages in Indonesia caused information distribution not easily available, however donors find it difficult to get the right information about food reserves, especially rice stock in orphanages. This paper proposes an IoT-based system where rice stocks in orphanages can be detected by Raspberry pi which is connected to sensors, data information from raspberry-pi connected to the network that can be accessed and monitored by mobile applications. This application designed for service providers, donors and rice suppliers. Donors send rice through financial transactions with service providers, and rice suppliers will ship items to the orphanage. Blockchain technology is applied to all parties in order to he transparent and reduce transaction manipulation.

AB Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise education in a number of ways. In this paper, we explore the applications of Smart Blockchain Badges on data science education. In particular, we investigate how Smart Blockchain Badges can support learners that want to advance their careers in data science, by offering them personalised recommendations based on their learning achievements. This work aims at enhancing data science accreditation by introducing a robust system based on the Blockchain technology. Learners will benefit from a sophisticated, open and transparent accreditation system, as well as from receiving job recommendations that match their skills and can potentially progress their careers. As a result, this work contributes towards closing the data science skills gap by linking data science education to the industry.

AB Various types of cryptocurrency e.g. BitCoin, Ethereum, Zcash, and more, are broadly accepted and used in many different forms of business but a typical problem that the cryptocurrency users are faced with is the delay of coin transfer. For example, it takes several hours for BitCoin and several minutes for Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies also consume a high quantity of electricity for transaction validation. Even though there currently is a type of cryptocurrencies, Ripple, that can be quickly transferred in 4 seconds but still it is a closed system with an owner, not a public cryptocurrency. Similarly, an algorithm "Proof of Stake" used by new coins that are more energy-saving but several problems are still found including (1) 51% attack, (2) a richer with more coins gains higher rewards, and (3) a problematic node for block validation that is not currently active. This research presents a model of an open cryptocurrency system that is able to transfer a coin within 3 seconds in which an algorithm called "Random-Checkers Proof of Stake" (RCPoS) was proposed to randomly select the inspectors for validation processes which can avoid those three problems of the Proof of Stake.

AB In recent years, blockchain technology has become widespread, and there are now many related open source blockchain projects and services around the world. However, although blockchain are based on decentralized mechanisms, the permission management of current systems is privileged and can only be accessed by users with "admin" authority, who (in turn) manage all of the general users. Therefore, current blockchain structures are not ideal because most users cannot take full advantage of their features, and current access control methods cannot safeguard against compromised admins. With those points in mind, this paper proposes a novel method for decentralized authority management in blockchain that is based on Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws. The results of a simulation using the proposed method written in the Prolog programming language are also demonstrated.

ID NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS
AB Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and trustable ledger for recording and storing digital transactions. The mining process of blockchain, however, requires to consume heavy computation-resources to solve the proof-of-work puzzle, which is prohibitive from the perspective of the conventional mobile terminals (MTs). In this work, we investigate the mobile edge computing (MEC) assisted Blockchain, in which a group of MTs exploit MEC to enhance their computing-powers for solving the proof-of-work puzzle. In particular, we consider the recent advanced multiple-access MEC (MA-MEC) which enables each MT to acquire the computing-powers from several edge servers (ESs) simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization problem which aims at maximizing the total reward of all MTs, while keeping the fairness among the MTs. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose efficient layered algorithms to compute the optimal solution. Extensive numerical results have been provided to validate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

AB The security issue is one of the greatest challenges in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) attracting a great deal of attention. Malicious onboard units (OBUs) can attack other OBUs with various manners to obtain illegal gains, such as jamming, eavesdropping spoofing and so on. To reduce the potential attackers in the network, we propose an indirect reciprocity security framework with a scalar reputation assigned to each OBU to evaluate their dangerous level to the VANET. A blockchain technique that uses consensus mechanism and encryption algorithms to protect information from being tampered is applied for the transmitter to record the behaviors of other OBUs. We also propose a reinforcement learning based action selection strategy for an OBU in the VANET to choose a reliable relay OBU or determine whether to follow the request of a source OBU or not. A hotbooting technique is applied for the OBUs with prior knowledge to accelerate the learning speed. Simulation results show that the proposed action selection strategy can efficiently increase the packet delivery ratio, the reputation and the utility of the each OBU.

AB With the explosive growth of smart IoT devices at the edge of the Internet, embedding sensors on mobile devices for massive data collection and collective environment sensing has been envisioned as a cost-effective solution for IoT applications. However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated middleware for (semi-)centralized task dispatching, data storage and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use the power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission and the transaction fee incurred by the blockchain's distributed ledger services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize their individual payoff. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the existence of the Nash equilibria as well as a series of insightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.

DE blockchain; DAO; e-government; transparency; auditability
AB E-government system has greatly improved the efficiency and transparency of daily operations of a government. However, most of existing e-government services are provided in a centralized manner and heavily rely on human individuals to control. The highly centralized IT infrastructure is more vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, it is relatively easy to compromise the data integrity by inside rogue users. Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced. We provide a concrete use case to demonstrate the usage of DAO e-government and evaluate its effectiveness.

ID ATTACK
AB Peer to Peer (P2P) is a dynamic and self-organized technology, popularly used in File sharing applications to achieve better performance and avoids single point of failure. The popularity of this network has attracted many attackers framing different attacks including Sybil attack, Routing Table Insertion attack (RTI) and Free Riding. Many mitigation methods are also proposed to defend or reduce the impact of such attacks. However, most of those approaches are protocol specific. In this work, we propose a Blockchain based security framework for P2P network to address such security issues. which can be tailored to any P2P file-sharing system.

DE Decentralized Machine Learning; Blockchain; Differential Privacy;
   Byzantine Attack
AB With the onset of the big data era, designing efficient and effective machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale data is in dire need. In practice, data is typically generated by multiple parties and stored in a geographically distributed manner, which spurs the study of distributed machine learning. Traditional master-worker type of distributed machine learning algorithms assumes a trusted central server and focuses on the privacy issue in linear learning models, while privacy in nonlinear learning models and security issues are not well studied. To address these issues, in this paper, we explore the blockchain technique to propose a decentralized privacy-preserving and secure machine learning system, called LearningChain, by considering a general (linear or nonlinear) learning model and without a trusted central server. Specifically, we design a decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to learn a general predictive model over the blockchain. In decentralized SGD, we develop differential privacy based schemes to protect each party's data privacy, and propose an l-nearest aggregation algorithm to protect the system from potential Byzantine attacks. We also conduct theoretical analysis on the privacy and security of the proposed LearningChain. Finally, we implement LearningChain on Etheurum and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through extensive experiments.

AB Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed storage that stores chronological series of transactions in a tamper-resistant manner. Blockchain became popular in various industries due to its decentralized trust ecosystem. When integrating blockchain with big data, one encounters many challenges. Current public blockchain does not support high transaction throughput; it does not scale in terms of big data storage and management; it does not provide keyword-based search and retrieval; and so on. As a result, it is hard to incorporate existing blockchain systems for big data applications. In this research, we propose a new blockchain storage "Mystiko" that is built over the Apache Cassandra distributed database to incorporate big data. Mystiko supports high transaction throughput, high scalability, high availability and full text search features. With Mystiko, we make big data more secure, structured and meaningful, and allows further data analytics on big data to be more easily performed.

DE Log system; the blockchain; block synchronization; nodes discovery
AB The logging system records the logs generated by the software so that the administrator can handle the problems that occur. However, the traditional log system is not secure enough and the stored logs are easily falsified. As a decentralized distributed storage technology, the blockchain can ensure that the blockchain network works normally in the presence of a few malicious nodes or failed nodes. So we use the blockchain to store the logs, which improves the security of the log system. In order to improve the performance of the blockchain, we use a voting-based consensus algorithm as a blockchain consistency protocol. This article introduces the architecture and implementation of the log system and verifies the feasibility of the system through experiments.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB In recent years, there has been a growing research attention and practitioner interest in exploring the suitability of Blockchain technology for decentralised applications in multiple domains. This paper investigates the application of Blockchain technology to address some of the key challenges faced by the domain of Social Business (SB). SB is a business model for investments in social causes for the socio-economic development of under-privileged communities. We have modelled a small example of micro-credit use-case from microfinance activities of SB using a semi-formal modelling approach using Blockchain technology. We identified that the Blockchain technology provide solutions that enhance trust, transparency and auditability in SB activities. However, we have also identified challenges related to creating a native cryptocurrency for SB, and barriers to infrastructure and technology adoption by the different stakeholders in SB.

AB Smart Grids is an emerging technology promising significant changes in the economy and the social sphere. One among many challenges in their development and distribution is security. Considering recent hackers attacks on energy grids and taking into account the distributed structure of these systems the use of traditional means of computer protection and the search for a crime figure becomes more difficult or impossible. In this article, we introduce some application areas of smart grid forensic science, discuss the opportunities, and outline the open issues in the topic. We summarized challenges for forensic in Smart Grids in connection with a Blockchain and proposed a decentralized transaction platform based on Blockchain tailored to the energy sector with all the latest technology such as advanced metering infrastructure, distributed generation, etc.

   Resolution
AB In this paper, we analyze the value of smart contracts and blockchains as an alternative to traditional contractual obligations. In particular, we start by exploring some of the advantages of these technologies, specifically the immutability of blockchains and automated contract remittance. We also discuss two critical shortcomings of decentralized smart contracts, namely regulatory uncertainty and a lack of confidential execution. With these issues in mind, we next explore how American legislators have begun to address smart contracts and blockchains. Though quite limited, there have been a few provisions clarifying the status of these technologies. We break down some of the language expressed in these bills so as to understand the current legal status of smart contracts and blockchains. Given this foundation, we consider the next steps that should be taken as smart contracts mature. This pertains to both the continued improvement of the underlying technology as well as the progress taken by regulators. Finally, assuming a futuristic scenario where there are no technological or regulatory barriers to smart contract adoption, we discuss how the process of contract remittance can be expedited in a world fully committed to the use of smart contracts.

AB The state-of-the-art approaches for tracking data provenance on high-performance computing (HPC) systems are either supported by file systems or relational databases. These techniques shared the same critique on the provenance data's fidelity and the associated I/O overhead. This paper envisions to track the HPC data provenance using a distributed inmemory ledger-the core technique leveraged by blockchains and proven to be highly trustworthy by many large-scale applications. We pinpoint two system challenges-storage architecture and consensus protocol-for adopting blockchains to HPC and make the following contributions: (i) We design a new in-memory blockchain architecture for HPC systems, exploiting the high-performance network infrastructure InfiniBand and greatly reducing the I/O overhead; and (ii) We develop a new consensus protocol, namely proof-of-reproducibility (PoR), crafted for the new architecture, which takes into account both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms. The correctness of PoR is both theoretically proven and experimentally verified. A prototype system is implemented and evaluated with more than one million transactions, showing 32x speedup compared to the filesystem-based provenance service and four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the database-based provenance service.

DE scientific workflow; blockchain; provenance; experiment reproducibility;
   transaction verification
AB In a research community, the provenance sharing of scientific workflows can enhance distributed research cooperation, experiment reproducibility verification and experiment repeatedly doing. Considering that scientists in such a community are often in a loose relation and distributed geographically, traditional centralized provenance sharing architectures have shown their disadvantages in poor trustworthiness, reliabilities and efficiency. Additionally, they are also difficult to protect the rights and interests of data providers. All these have been largely hindering the willings of distributed scientists to share their workflow provenance. Considering the big advantages of blockchain in decentralization, trustworthiness and high reliability, an approach to sharing scientific workflow provenance based on blockchain in a research community is proposed. To make the approach more practical, provenance is handled on-chain and original data is delivered off-chain. A kind of block structure to support efficient provenance storing and retrieving is designed, and an algorithm for scientists to search workflow segments from provenance as well as an algorithm for experiments backtracking are provided to enhance the experiment result sharing, save computing resource and time cost by avoiding repeated experiments as far as possible. Analyses show that the approach is efficient and effective.

   Adoption Rate
AB Railways around the world are moving towards digitalization to enhance their operations. The integration of railway data with other transport modes data becomes a vital part of the next generation of digital transport systems. One of the challenges for further digitization is data integration and security. This situation remains a challenge across organizations and industry boundaries. The blockchain is a new technology that might have the potential for acting as an enabler for the data integration and security challenge. In this paper a moderate literature review on the use of blockchain around different industries, in particular IoT applications, and in the railway context has been demonstrated. Opportunities and challenges that the blockchain technology can offer for the railway industry has been outlined.
   The paper has also looked at railway related blockchain current and potential applications. A simple analysis of the technology for the potential adoption rate has also been discussed. It was found that the blockchain can offer a number of benefits including added security and decentralization, however it will have a moderate technology adoption rate before it reaches it is transformative impact. In order to overcome some the adoption rate barriers in the railways, the author has developed a speech recognition and mobility based interface that can be utilized across different transport organizations, which can help in the data collection and pave the way for block chain applications. The solution was given the name of "inspectro".

AB This paper addresses the problem of uploading large quantities of sensitive industrial data to a public distributed network by proposing a new framework. The framework combines the existing technologies of the distributed web and distributed ledger to provide a mechanism of encrypting data and choosing whom to share the data with. The framework is designed to work with existing platforms; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum blockchain platforms are used as examples within this paper, though it is stated that similar platforms are capable of providing the requirements for the framework to operate. The framework uses the concept of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE), and is implemented in three different mechanisms of the DHKE: one-step Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH); two-step ECDH; and Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (SIDH). The paper discusses the security of each along with individual advantages and disadvantages, and concludes that the SIDH is the most appropriate implementation for future use due to it being post-quantum secure.

AB Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.

AB This paper introduces a system for providing integrity, authenticity, and privacy of data transactions for resource-limited Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices using blockchain (BC) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). In particular, we introduce two mechanisms: one provides privacy and integrity protections on the data being collected by the smart devices, such as medical records or diagnostic data, and the other provides authenticity and integrity of data going into the smart devices, such as software updates. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed mechanisms incur small overhead in terms of storage, communication, and computation, indicating their feasibility to IoT devices with limited storage, computational, and communicational capabilities.

AB Energy conservation measurements in buildings are more and more popular as they benefit from an intelligent contractual framework called Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), where energy savings are measured as the difference between a predictive baseline model and the actual consumption. While modern predictive models make use of large amounts of data from external sources and increasingly complex algorithms, these two aspects make their use difficult in practice because they need mutual understanding and transparency, requiring the involvement of a third-party for auditing. In this sense, we designed and developed a prototype that overcomes these issues by storing the predictive models and the data in an immutable blockchained data structure using the Ethereum framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first working prototype using the blockchain technology applied to EPCs. This paper presents and discusses the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in this prototype.

AB The construction of smart city involves multiple corporate organizations and government agencies, while smart city operations often require data across organizations. This paper describes a blockchain-based approach to exchange information in smart cities that assists sharing data across multiple, nontrusted organizations. The proposed method enables an organization safely use data from another organization to participate in business operations without accessing the data. The data that participates in operations is in an encrypted form stored only in the executor sandbox. Consensus calculations are performed on multiple nodes by smart contract. After the confirmation through multiple nodes, the result of the calculation will be returned to the applicant. Thus, the risk of data leakage could be avoided. Our proposed method can effectively prevent the access to the information from being illegally obtained, used, and tampered. Also it ensures the reliable use of the data which enables the effective information sharing and protection of information among multiple organizations in the smart city applications.

AB Background: The application of the blockchain technology has shown promises in various areas, such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things, land registry management, identity management, etc. Although Github currently hosts more than three thousand active blockchain software (BCS) projects, a few software engineering research has been conducted on their software engineering practices. Aims: To bridge this gap, we aim to carry out the first formal survey to explore the software engineering practices including requirement analysis, task assignment, testing, and verification of blockchain software projects. Method: We sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that standard software engineering methods including testing and security best practices need to be adapted with more seriousness to address unique characteristics of blockchain and mitigate potential threats.

AB Enterprise Architecture (EA) represents both business and Information Technology (IT) perspectives, which must be constantly updated in response to the transformations of the company; this update is difficult to achieve. The problem has been addressed on different fronts and there are still ways to explore, one of them is the blockchain technology, especially the way to extend the logic of smart contracts to the company. In this study the authors propose to implement a new type of operational processes activity through smart contracts, which could detect that, the process in which they are operating, has an unexpected behavior and, in turn, warn of possible needs to update the AE and the same smart contract.

ID MODEL CHECKER; VERIFICATION
AB The decentralized trading market approach, where both autonomous agents and people can consume and produce services expanding own opportunities to reach goals, looks very promising as a part of the Fourth Industrial revolution. The key component of the approach is a blockchain platform that allows an interaction between agents via liability smart contracts. Reliability of a service provider is usually determined by a reputation model. However, this solution only warns future customers about an extent of trust to the service provider in case it could not execute any previous liabilities correctly. From the other hand a blockchain consensus protocol can additionally include a validation procedure that detects incorrect liability executions in order to suspend payment transactions to questionable service providers. The paper presents the validation methodology of a liability execution for agent-based service providers in a decentralized trading market, using the Model Checking method based on the mathematical model of finite state automata and Temporal Logic properties of interest. To demonstrate this concept, we implemented the methodology in the Duckietown application, moving an autonomous mobile robot to achieve a mission goal with the following behavior validation at the end of a completed scenario.

ID TRACEABILITY
AB Complexity in automotive electrics/electronics development increases steadily due to new technologies, e.g. autonomous driving. Knowledge and hence development is more distributed among equal engineering partners and suppliers who become more and might join ad hoc, e.g. a start-up provides a new software faster and cheaper. Development artifacts have to be reconciled and traceability between E/E systems and their components has to be ensured to avoid errors, incompatibilities, and high coordination effort. Model -based systems engineering (MBSE) starts early in the development process by defining formal models which link and trace all system elements. However, there still is a gap between MBSE and later product data and lifecycle management (PD1VI/PLM) because these disciplines have different meta models. This paper presents a framework, methodologically and technologically, to bridge this gap. Therefore, the Blockchain technology provides valuable mechanisms for engineering collaboration. MBSE methodologies are assessed, aligned with PDM/PLM, and prototypically implemented.

AB Businesses and organizations have for long been trying to tackle the most prominent issues regarding identity management and systems. Traditionally, the proof of trust concerning the identification of a citizen, a customer or a participant in any business or transaction consisted always in a physical evidence (e.g., a signature, fingerprint, photo or other) whose value would rely on a trusted third-party such as a notary or attorney that confirmed the veracity of that physical evidence. More recent approaches include novel types of evidence such as digital certificates, but still these have no value unless they are issued and signed by a trusted centralized third-party that confirms the authenticity of the certificate. These are then often used by businesses to identify and trace their parties and stakeholders, in a process known as "Know Your Customer" (KYC). This process is often slow and requires costly human intervention. This paper presents WalliD, a decentralized approach of a secure protocol to handle customer identification using Blockchain. The paper then shows a proof of concept workflow implementation of this protocol developed using an Ethereum Wallet.

AB In the last few years, novel approaches for using blockchain to solve Internet of Things (IoT) security and dependability issues have been proposed. Currently, different solutions were applied to Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Grids, Supply Chains, Industry, and Vehicular Networks scenarios. Despite of that, the main advantages on the adoption of different architectures, models and algorithms proposed in the state of art of blockchain in IoT scenarios are not yet clear. This paper presents some discussion about the usage of blockchain technology in IoT environments and proposes a layer model of blockchains for IoT. In addition, we present an overview of the latest research regarding network architectures, consensus algorithms, data management, and applications. Finally, this paper presents open issues and future trends about blockchain in IoT.

DE Blockchain; Security; Risk Assessment; Threats
AB Recently, blockchain has attracted a great interest, and today it is considered not only as an innovative technology, but as a potential revolution for the world of business. The motivation of this enthusiasm is due to its capability of enabling new forms of records-keeping, transactions, and interactions between decentralized and mistrusting entities. Indeed, blockchain is driving companies to huge investments and strategic acquisitions, and it is raising innovation and research across industries and academia. However, besides the opportunities offered, this technology may expose institutions and interacting parties to new risks that have to be discovered, understood, and, where possible, eliminated or at least reduced. In this paper we identify the main threats of blockchain and assess their related impact. Then, applying a NIST-compliant approach, we perform a qualitative risk assessment. Finally, we review the possible countermeasures, where existing, for each threat analyzed, and discuss open challenges and future directions.

AB We propose a new way to organise both transactions and blocks in a distributed ledger to address the performance issues of permissionless ledgers. In contrast to most of the existing solutions in which the ledger is a chain of blocks extracted from a tree or a graph of chains, we present a distributed ledger whose structure is a balanced directed acyclic graph of blocks. We call this specific graph a SYC-DAG. We show that a SYC-DAG allows us to keep all the remarkable properties of the Bitcoin blockchain in terms of security, immutability, and transparency, while enjoying higher throughput and self-adaptivity to transactions demand. To the best of our knowledge, such a design has never been proposed so far.

AB People are increasingly connected to the Internet through their smartphones and each of these mobile devices has a wide range of sensors. The users themselves can be asked short questions about what they see. This crowdsensing has the potential to improve our daily lives by providing actual data about the environment and the use of services. However, there are significant obstacles to user participation like resource consumption and privacy concerns. There is a need for incentives to motivate the users.
   In this paper, we propose a tamper-proof incentive scheme for a mobile crowdsensing system that supports open sensing, with both automated and manual participation. We implemented a prototype of the system with server components and a mobile application. The proposed incentive scheme implements a tit-for tat approach: positive user participation is rewarded with points that are stored in a shared record. This incentive ledger uses a Blockchain so that it can be trusted by every participant. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme is practical and can be used to motivate increased participation in crowdsensing.

AB This paper introduces a new leaderless Byzantine consensus called the Democratic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) for blockchains. While most blockchain consensus protocols rely on a correct leader or coordinator to terminate, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty.
   The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message from a coordinator that may be slow. The resulting decentralization is particularly appealing for blockchains for two reasons: (i) each node plays a similar role in the execution of the consensus, hence making the decision inherently "democratic"; (ii) decentralization avoids bottlenecks by balancing the load, making the solution scalable.
   DBFT is deterministic, assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. We first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus whose fast path terminates in 4 message delays.

AB An increased incidence of food mislabeling and handling in recent years has led to consumers demanding transparency in how food items are produced and handled. The current traceability solutions suffer from issues such as scattering of information across multiple silos and susceptibility in recording erroneous data and thus are often unable to produce reliable farm to fork stories of products. Blockchain (BC) is a promising technology that could play an important role in providing data transparency and integrity due to its salient features which include decentralisation, immutability and auditability. In this paper, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework which is governed by a consortium of key Food Supply Chain (FSC) entities including government and regulatory bodies to promote food provenance. We propose to use a sharded, three-tiered architecture which ensures availability of data to consumers, limits access to competitive partners and provides scalability for handling transaction load. We also propose a transaction vocabulary and access rights to manage read and write privileges to BC supported by the consortium. The framework, ProductChain, ensures that trade flows are kept confidential when provenance information is retrieved by consumers and stakeholders. Simulation results show that query time for a product ledger is of the order of a few milliseconds even when the information is collated from multiple shards. ProductChain is generalised and applicable to supply chains in diverse industries.

   Stochastic Reward Nets
AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is an open-source implementation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts in a modular architecture. In this paper, we present a performance model of Hyperledger Fabric v1.0+ using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN). From our detailed model, we can compute the throughput, utilization and mean queue length at each peer and critical processing stages within a peer. To validate our model, we setup an HLF network in our lab and run workload using Hyperledger Caliper. From our analysis results, we find that time to complete the endorsement process is significantly affected by the number of peers and policies such as AND ( ). The performance bottleneck of the ordering service and ledger write can be mitigated using a larger block size, albeit with an increase in latency. For the committing peer, the transaction validation check (using Validation System Chaincode (VSCC)) is a time-consuming step, but its performance impact can be easily mitigated since it can be parallelized. However, its performance is critical, since it absorbs the shock of bursty block arrivals. We also analyze various what-if scenarios, such as peers processing transactions in a pipeline, and multiple endorsers per organization.

DE Crowdsourcing; decentralization; blockchain; smart contract; Ethereum
AB With the gradual promotion, crowdsourcing has become an efficient way to solve problems that are very complicated for computers and simple for human crowd intelligence in recent years. Traditional crowdsourcing is based on a central system where requesters post tasks on a crowdsourcing central server or platform, however, this centralized model currently faces various challenges such as prohibitive cost, single point of failure, and vulnerability to malicious attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a smart contract-based decentralized online crowdsourcing mechanism, which includes task assignment rules and reward payment rules, etc. The mechanism has the characteristics like decentralization, unalterable, truthfulness and so on. In addition, the corresponding smart contract is designed, so that the mechanism can really run and process the actual data, and the effectiveness is shown by experiments. In this way, the entire crowdsourcing process no longer requires the participation of trusted third-party agencies, information and privacy security is guaranteed, and the cost is lower.

AB In order to solve the problems occurring in the current data collection apps, the methodologies of blockchain including decentralized data transmission, transaction security, data privacy, and permanent data storage are adopted in the Exercise and Diet Architecture (EDA). In EDA, personal data is stored and transferred under the secure mechanism in the blockchain network In which, all data are protected through secure hash algorithm and digital signature, which could be decrypt only through the corresponding key. Moreover, all transactions are transmitted in privacy because of the peer to peer transmission method. Thus, EDA is designed for storing data in a fully privacy and security environment.

AB Smart contracts play an advent role in automated business participation by rendering collaboration processes more time efficient, cost-effective and establishing more transparency. Smart contracts facilitate trust-less systems, without the need for intervention from third-party intermediaries. Existing smart contract languages mainly focus on technical utility and do not take into consideration social and legally relevant issues, e.g., lack of semantics, ontological completeness, and so on. In this research, we address the gap by developing with rigorous means a smart contract's language that aims to be legally relevant, and that comprises socio-technical utility for cross organizational business collaboration. The proposed language seeks to retain the strengths of the already existing languages of different generations while eluding their limitations. We aim to identify and implement abstract grammar patterns for a smart-contract language that has the expected application utility and verifiability. We evaluate the developed language based on automating industry-collaboration cases with our novel smart contract language to test the suitability, utility and expressiveness.

AB Distributed Ledgers, such as blockchains implement business collaboration processes in the form of smart contracts (SCs). Blockchain technology and smart contracts have received significant attention as they exhibit autonomy, decentralization, trust, and transparency over peer-to-peer networks while moving the assets digitally among peers without a third-party such as lawyers in conventional contracts (CCs). Smart contracts are computerized scripts or protocols that execute contractual clauses when certain pre-defined conditions meet and thereby digitally enforce the negotiation and performance of a contract. Smart contracts, although, being self-executable and self-enforceable, are irreversible once written and lack contractual flexibility in the face of a contingency. A high degree of automation is sought to manifest blockchain enabled smart contracts into the so-called self-aware contracts (SAC) that can be aware of its internal contextual environment and the external environment or real world events. This Ph.D. work aims to develop the belief-desire intention (BDI) model based multi-agent system (MAS) on the top of the smart contracts to yield the so-called self-aware human readable contracts for legal viability. This research follows the guidelines of the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology.

ID HEALTH DATA; COOPERATIVES; MODEL
AB Health-related data analysis plays an important role in self-knowledge, disease prevention, diagnosis, and quality of life assessment. With the advent of data-driven solutions, a myriad of apps and Internet of Things (IoT) devices (wearables, home-medical sensors, etc) facilitates data collection and provide cloud storage with a central administration. More recently, blockchain and other distributed ledgers became available as alternative storage options based on decentralised organisation systems. We bring attention to the human data bleeding problem and argue that neither centralised nor decentralised system organisations are a magic bullet for data-driven innovation if individual, community and societal values are ignored. The motivation for this position paper is to elaborate on strategies to protect privacy as well as to encourage data sharing and support open data without requiring a complex access protocol for researchers. Our main contribution is to outline the design of a self-regulated Open Health Archive (OHA) system with focus on quality of life (QoL) data.

AB As research on blockchain continues to grow, blockchain technology was adopted to develop several information systems. There are many opportunities to examine the utilization of blockchain technology to be used in developing systems as needed. This paper summarizes the conditions of blockchain research in terms of technology and its implementation. This paper was written using a systematic literature review (SLR) as one of the methodologies used to solve problems by tracing the results of previous studies. The problem that you want to study in SLR is usually referred to as a research question (RQ). The defined RQ is related to the topic and clarifies each question by tracing previous research papers indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springerlink, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 41 articles, the result is: blockchain can be used in many applications, some applications that adopt blockchain technology are banking applications, e- voting applications and digital forensic applications. Often, applications that use blockchain technology only focus on developing one of the blockchain technologies that suits their needs. Some developers maximize the components of the contract on the blockchain, some further develop the data structure of the blockchain itself. The use of blockchain technology is still wide open for the implementation of other information systems. The expected contribution of this paper is to provide a general overview for researchers who want to build applications that use blockchain as a basis for researching so they can conduct further studies to better understand whether the applications they will develop are suitable for using blockchain technology as a basis.

AB In 21st century one of the revolutionary technologies is Blockchain. It can bring regularity ideas to public and private sectors which improve the present management failures.To permit peer-to-peer transactions, Blockchiain maintains continuously growing list of records as a distributive database. In future, the existing conventional energy sources cannot meet the electricity demand. The renewable electricity generation is growing to balance supply and demand and accounts to share in the overall power supply. In the concept of smart cities development, The energy distribution without any intermediaries has a major concern. This emerging blockchain technology provides distributive and decentralized solutions for energy transactions. In this paper, a permissioned blockchain that uses hyperledger fabric to provide a peer-to-peer energy transacting network in order to accommodate the growing volume of renewable energy supply.

AB The ubiquitous deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices enhances connectivity and communication, and benefits almost every aspect of our lives from manufacturing to retail to smart homes. However, low levels of security protection in these devices due to their limited resources open opportunities for malicious users. An IoT forensics system collecting, processing, analyzing and reporting evidence of attack is required to mitigate the IoT security issues. Although such system has been studied over the past decade and solutions such as cloud-based IoT forensic were proposed, limitation still exist. In this paper, leveraging on the blockchain technology, we propose a permissioned blockchain-based IoT forensics framework to enhance the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation properties for the collected evidence. We formally define the system architecture, provide framework details, and propose a cryptographic-based approach to mitigate identity privacy concern.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) applications require heavy computations, so an embedded device with limited hardware such as an IoT device cannot run the apps by itself. One solution is to offload DNN computations from the client device to nearby edge servers [1] to request an execution of the DNN computations with their powerful hardware. However, there are several issues with the solution. One is an availability issue that how we can provide the edge server with some incentives to run the client' apps. The other is a scalability issue that how we can use more servers when there are more DNN requests. Finally, there is an integrity issue that how the client can trust the result coming from anonymous edge servers. We think the blockchain technology can solve these issues to make edge computing more practical. This paper proposes a novel architecture for DNN edge computing based on the blockchain technology. Existing blockchains such as Ethereum do not support execution of a complex program, so we propose a modified blockchain structure and protocol to overcome the limitation.

AB Bitcoin has created a new exchange paradigm within which financial transactions can be trusted without an intermediary. This premise of a free decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.

AB Airdrops are a popular method of distributing cryptocurrencies and tokens. While often considered risk-free from the point of view of recipients, their impact on privacy is easily overlooked. We examine the Clam airdrop of 2014, a forerunner to many of today's airdrops, that distributed a new cryptocurrency to every address with a non-dust balance on the Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains. Specifically, we use address clustering to try to construct the one-to-many mappings from entities to addresses on the blockchains, individually and in combination. We show that the sharing of addresses between the blockchains is a privacy risk. We identify instances where an entity has disclosed information about their address ownership on the Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains, exclusively via their activity on the Clam blockchain.

AB The security of web communication via the SSL/TLS protocols relies on safe distributions of public keys associated with web domains in the form of X.509 certificates. Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted third parties that issue these certificates. However, the CA ecosystem is fragile and prone to compromises. Starting with Google's Certificate Transparency project, a number of research works have recently looked at adding transparency for better CA accountability, effectively through public logs of all certificates issued by certification authorities, to augment the current X.509 certificate validation process into SSL/TLS.
   In this paper, leveraging recent progress in blockchain technology, we propose a novel system, called CTB, that makes it impossible for a CA to issue a certificate for a domain without obtaining consent from the domain owner. We further make progress to equip CTB with certificate revocation mechanism. We implement CTB using IBM's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. CTB's smart contract, written in Go, is provided for complete reference.

AB The recently emerged blockchain (in particular smart contract) technology offers an enticing opportunity for decentralized sharing economy. Machine learning can be one important subroutine in such a decentralized ecosystem. Unfortunately, machine learning programs are usually computational intensive as well as randomized, which fall into the inherent limitations of open blockchain where complex and randomized programs cannot be executed by the underlying nodes collectively.
   Given also the limitations of existing verifiable computing techniques, we propose a crowdsourcing idea from the game theoretic perspective to resolve the tension. We design a simple incentive mechanism so that the execution of a wide range of complex programs can be crowdsourced via the blockchain, and any false computing result could be deterred. In particular, our protocol works in the scenarios that there is no trusted thirdparty involved; Moreover, our protocol not only works in the classical model of non-colluding service providers, but also can tolerate any potential coalition up to n - 1, where n is the total number of service providers. We also showcase how to use our protocol to crowdsource two typical kinds of machine learning tasks via open blockchain.
   We envision that our solution is not only promising to launch decentralized applications involving a wide range of machine learning programs, but also a stepping stone towards a general way to empowering intensive and randomized computations atop the open blockchain.

DE blockchain; sustainability; funding; treasury
AB Blockchain technology has pioneered a new consensus approach to building a distributed public ledger globally. A key feature expected from cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems is the absence of a centralized control over the operation process. That is, blockchain solutions should neither rely on "trusted parties or powerful minority" for their operations, nor introduce such centralisation tendencies into blockchain systems.
   On the other hand, real-world blockchain systems require steady funding for continuous development and maintenance of the systems. Given that blockchain systems are decentralized systems, their maintenance and developmental funding should also be void of centralization risks. Therefore, secure and "community-inclusive" long-term sustainability of funding is critical for the health of blockchain platforms.
   In this work, for the first time, we provide a systematic exposition of blockchain development funding, planning, management, and disbursement mechanisms aka "treasury systems" (for cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems). Drawing from existing literature, we identify and categorise various treasury models, thereby enabling an exploration of their properties, benefits and drawbacks. Particularly, we perform an evaluation of real-world cryptocurrency treasury system of top cryptocurrencies e.g., Dash governance system, and ZCash Foundation. Finally, we briefly discuss desired properties of decentralised treasury systems and provide suggestions for improvement or alternative solutions to existing systems or implementations.

AB A decentralized ride-or carsharing application is among the early proposals of what smart contracts on blockchains may enable in the future. To facilitate use cases in the field of location-based services (LBS), smart contracts need to receive trustworthy positioning information, and be able to process them. We propose an approach on how geofences can be defined in smart contracts, and how supplied positions can be evaluated on whether they are contained in the geofence or not. The approach relies on existing location encoding systems like Geohashes and S2 cells that can transform polygons into a grid of cells. These can be stored in a smart contract to represent a geofence. An oracle run by a mobile network provider can submit network-based positioning information to the contract, that compares it with the geofence. We evaluate the location encoding systems on their ability to model city geofences and mobile network cell position estimates and analyze the costs associated with storing and evaluating received oracle-positions in an Ethereum-based smart contract implementation. Our results show that S2 encodings perform better than Geohashes, that the one-time cost of geofence definition corresponds linearly with the number of grid cells used, and that the evaluation of oracle-submitted locations does not incur high costs.

AB This paper describes BlockPKI, a blockchain-based public-key infrastructure that enables an automated, resilient, and transparent issuance of digital certificates. Our goal is to address several shortcomings of the current TLS infrastructure and its proposed extensions. In particular, we aim at reducing the power of individual certification authorities and make their actions publicly visible and accountable, without introducing yet another trusted third party. To demonstrate the benefits and practicality of our system, we present evaluation results and describe our prototype implementation.

ID INVERSE COVARIANCE ESTIMATION
AB This paper proposes a framework for collaborative anomaly detection on Blockchain. Taking condition-based management of industrial asset as a practical example, we extend the notion of Smart Contract, which has been implicitly assumed to be deterministic, to be able to handle noisy sensor data. By formalizing the task of collaborative anomaly detection as that of multi-task probabilistic dictionary learning, we show that major technical issues of validation, consensus building, and data privacy are naturally addressed within a statistical machine learning algorithm. We envision Blockchain as a platform for collaborative learning rather than just a traceable, immutable, and decentralized data management system, suggesting the direction towards "Blockchain 3.0".

AB Blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger technology which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications to address lack-of-trust issues in business. Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. The existing BaaS solutions mostly focus on easier and faster deployment of blockchain applications. However, design of blockchain applications is challenging to developers as it requires development experiences and deep understanding of blockchain technologies. Therefore, this paper summarises a set of design patterns and delivers them as a service to support design of blockchain application. We present a service platform which applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design of blockchain applications to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The platform also provides two auxiliary services, including key management and file comparison, which are often needed in blockchain applications. The feasibility of the proposed solutions is evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case.

AB Blockchain technology combined with IoT to improve the reliability of the supply chain system is one of the topics in great demand lately. Due to the nature of blockchain, it is suitable to be applied in the supply chain to improve the level of service with security guarantees. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of blockchain in the supply chain using Ethereum smart contract to maintain ownership of digital assets and to track the origin of a product. By leveraging the proposed model, the user can be protected by minimizing the fake online trading activity because product assets that have been recorded by blockchain can be guaranteed since the data cannot be changed by anyone (tamper-proof). Further research needs to be developed, especially the connection between IoT devices and the blockchain network to improve the reliability and effectiveness of the decentralized supply chain system.

DE Blockchain; scalability; extensibility; performance
AB It has been a long time since Nakamoto Satoshi introduced Bitcoin [1]. However, the underlying technology, blockchain, has been getting more and more attention. It is regarded as one of the most important technology for the fourth industrial revolution, although there exit few the real-world production-level applications due to the hardly tolerant performance of most of the existing blockchain systems. Therefore, how to improve its performance has been identified as one of the most significant research directions in order to use blockchain for practical applications. In this paper, we present a method to build a scalable and extendible blockchain system by multiple chains and sharding techniques.

AB This paper proposes a blockchain federated mediator architecture to support querying and cooperation activities. Due to the data and programs are crossing various blockchain systems, leveraging the information poses challenges especially for the reason of heterogeneity introduced by the information systems. The mediation services are expected to play an important role in helping automated processes to access the heterogeneous information from various chains. While there are no answers from a mediator because of the unsatisfication of search criteria for a single object, the mediators are able to collaborate with each other in order to make a composite answer by grouping a set of objects. In this paper, we introduce such a mediator-based architecture on blockchains and its implementation from the industry perspective.

AB Based on the recent rapid progress of big data analysis and AI technology, it is expected that large amount of data and latest analyzing technologies are combined with the creativeness of people, then co-creation across industries is accelerated to create innovative services or products. To realize that, it is inevitable to build system to share data in the society across industries securely, utilize them, and create value continuously. In this document, we introduce Fujitsu's solution development to realize data exchange and utilization society. Especially we focus on the "consortium" structure, where people are connected with mutual trust, and that is key factor to reduce various risk and insecure feeling about dealing with data then accelerate data utilization.

AB It is difficult to deny the impact of the formation of the so-called crypto-economy on existing financial institutions. This current trend has taken shape and has taken its place in the current economic environment. Despite this, in view of the absence of regulatory and legal regulation, basic concepts, methods of evaluation, management and optimization of crypto-economics processes have not yet been formulated. The present study is devoted to the pricing of ICO as a source of financing for the activities of enterprises that are used practically in all sectors of the economy.

AB The blockchain is decentralized network system that verifies the validity of the transaction through the consensus of the verifiers without trusted third parties. This mechanism ensures transaction integrity disclosing transaction information transparently. Therefore, it is emerging as the core technology of the 4th industrial revolution by improving reliability and efficiency with features of decentralization, ensuring the integrity, and economic cost reduction. However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.

AB In this paper, we propose a new IoT server platform by introducing a block chain and store sensor data in a block chain. Mobius selected IoT server platform, Mobius authenticates IoT devices conforming to oneM2M standard, receives real-time sensor data, stores information and data in Mysql server and manages it. However, Mysql's Mobius configuration has many vulnerabilities and threats to security, and many of them have not been addressed yet. This paper propose a data storage method by constructing a block chain as a database instead of a general / conventional server construction method such as Mysql server in the server configuration method by introducing such a block chain.

AB Nowadays, the blockchain is a favorite platform, for instance, for use with cryptocurrency, smart contracts, IoT, and so forth. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not trust each other to maintain states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. The blockchain applies the consensus protocol to verify the block which is distributing the network node. Consensus has many practices such as, for example, Byzantine general problem, Proof of work, and Proof of stake. However, there have not been numerous papers that have undertaken analysis with regard to various aspects, and which have incorporated the adoption summary as appropriate to the application. In this paper, we have provided a technical verification review with regard to the consensus algorithm taken from previous research. The audience will receive a consensus protocol, and the algorithm typically analyzes the application to match which platform is appropriate by viewing the node identity, energy saving and the tolerated power of the adversary, the data model, language, execution, application, and examples. Finally, we finish by presenting several research directions with regard to the consensus protocol.

AB Timed transaction execution is critical for various decentralized privacy-preserving applications powered by blockchain-based smart contract platforms. Such privacy-preserving smart contract applications need to be able to securely maintain users' sensitive inputs off the blockchain until a prescribed execution time and then automatically make the inputs available to enable on-chain execution of the target function at the execution time, even if the user goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust. This paper presents a new decentralized privacy-preserving transaction scheduling approach that allows users of Ethereum-based decentralized applications to schedule transactions without revealing sensitive inputs before an execution time window selected by the users. The proposed approach involves no centralized party and allows users to go offline at their discretion after scheduling a transaction. The sensitive inputs are privately maintained by a set of trustees randomly selected from the network enabling the inputs to be revealed only at the execution time. The proposed protocol employs secret key sharing and layered encryption techniques and economic deterrence models to securely protect the sensitive information against possible attacks including some trustees destroying the sensitive information or secretly releasing the sensitive information prior to the execution time. We demonstrate the attack-resilience of the proposed approach through rigorous analysis. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrates that the proposed approach is effective and has a low gas cost and time overhead associated with it.

AB The purpose of the research paper is to describe how the Blockchain technology can foster traceability of electric/electronics (E/E) information artifacts in product lifecycle management (PLM) with a focus on bridging the gap between model-bases systems engineering (MBSE) and product data management (PDM). Due to automotive development includes many parties, such as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, and new partners, a distribution mechanism for proclamation of changed information artifacts is necessary. The approach compares MBSE methods and identifies which information artifacts created there have to be linked with PDM artifacts. Practical implications for the exchange of data in engineering collaboration with multiple partners are assessed by a first proof of concept with a Blockchain prototype tested with a supplier. The originality of this approach stems from the application of the Blockchain technology in engineering IT, a meta data model to connect MBSE and PDM, and the facilitated inclusion of engineering collaboration partners by those means.

DE traceability; blockchain; autonomous driving; IoT
AB Autonomous driving (AD) promises to disrupt current process management practices in the automotive industry, as processes now have to fulfill increasing requirements for safety, quality and liability. This paradigm change especially manifests itself among electrical system suppliers, as the electrical components transmit the vehicle's energy and communication flow, determining safety critical functions in the vehicle such as steering and braking. In this research, we conducted a multiple embedded case study in the electrical supplier industry in order to derive current challenges as well as future requirements for production processes of safety critical products in the age of autonomous driving. Our data suggest, that the established manufacturing process and practices are unable to fulfill the increasing need for digital continuity, transparency and documentation. To overcome those barriers, we propose a blockchain (BC) and Internet of Things (IoT) enabled traceability system. Through the application of BC, processes can be interconnected, tracked and audited, achieving higher security, liability and quality. This is the first paper, which investigates manufacturing of electrical systems for self-driving vehicles as a suitable use case for BC application.

AB Is the distributed ledger technology able to predict the capital asset prices and digitizes any financial market participant? Prediction is a scary and tempting place to venture, profitable trading and the development of effective strategies. Will predictions fit into the everyday practice of financial markets? Is blockchain technology capable to revolutionize predictions? Is the blockchain able to compensate of the lack of individual intelligence in assessing market prospects? In the article, the authors do not so much raise these questions as they try to outline the directions for their solution. Financial inclusion is one of the problems that blockchain technology can solve, if it is applied properly. Transferring predictions to the online mode and providing each market participant with the opportunity to digitize their activities would help introduce new efficient mechanisms to improve performance of financial market practices. The article discusses two aspects of using blockchain technology in finance - forecasting financial markets using "collective knowledge" and digitizing assets of market participants based on blockchain. The article also raises the question of the possibility of using some fundamental physical laws for analyzing the impact of new technologies on the financial markets. An attempt is made to approach the assessment of the prospects of using a number of decentralized applications for financial market predictions and the creation of digital counterparts of market participants. A fundamental lesson from experiments in predicting financial markets and digitizing market participants is that decentralized solutions are still not sufficiently scaled and, as a result, are used by consumers.

AB The article is devoted to the discussion of actual problems of introduction of blockchain technology in banking business, the solution of which determines the prospects of wide commercialization of these innovations. Commercial banks' interest in innovation is determined by the threat of steadily declining business profitability and a new competitive threat to traditional sources of income from new fin-technologies. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, crypto-currencies), the use of blockchain by banks in the financial sector is still very modest. Like most of the participants in this market, banks only carefully test computer technologies for managing a distributed ledger, and therefore objective barriers hindering progress in this area are of actual interest to specialists and researchers. The application of any innovative technology in the banking business depends on the successful compliance of new opportunities and time-tested requirements of consumers in the financial sector. In particular for the technology of the blockchain, just has not fully resolved key-problems of standardization, boundary identification, security and cyber-security, reliability of execution transaction, scalability of projects, etc. Here considered the main barriers, from the author's viewpoint, of implementation of the blockchain in the banking business, confirmed by the authoritative materials of centers for innovative financial technology.

ID INTERNET-ENABLED CALIBRATION
AB One important way to improve product quality is by calibrating the instruments. Based on the traditional Digital Multimeter calibration process like gathering data, analysis and evaluation, make calibration certificate are still manually works. However, the calibrated measuring instrument is must be audited periodically, the data integrity is low since the calibration data only verified by laboratorium itself and the data on the calibration certificate can potentially be changed (datatampering) unilaterally to avoid the founded at the time of inspection from the auditor. Previous research as demonstrated that Digital Mutimeter calibration have been used information technology solutions using client-server and internet-enabled architectures, but the data management is still performed by centralized network. In this paper we have proposed system design of Blockchain-based technology for Digital Multimeter calibration which are a distributed system concept to every node in a network, but no nodes can control totally. Hence, the focus and the contribution of this paper is to proposed new system design as a Blockchain-based for Calibration of Digital Multimeter system. The proposed system design would have better data integrity to prevent potential data manipulation (tampering-data) for Digital Multimeter calibration results.

AB Internet of Things devices is more common and the growth of LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) technology is unavoidable. However, the regulation for this kind of technology is lack behind even though there will be multiple licensing and certification from national regulator and from industry. It will not easy to maintain and check the device's licensing for user and regulator, moreover if the product already had another type of licensing from abroad. It often happens that the vendor files a fake license claims of his products to fulfill the procurement. Therefore, licensing management is required for everyone goodness in the IoT industry. Blockchain implementation assessment framework can be used for assessing this case.

AB Standard security protocols are heavy weight in terms of memory foot prints which make all the security protocol unfit for budgeted platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). The blockchain (BC) is a very efficient architecture to preserve five basic cryptographic primitives, such as authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of blockchain in IoT causes significant energy consumption, delay, and computational overhead which are not suitable for various resource-constrained IoT devices. In our submission we change the basic architecture of blockchain and make it more efficient for IoT application. The article proposes an IoT based smart city architecture which adopted the blockchain technology preserving all the cryptographic security issues. The adoption of blockchain causes very minimal overhead on IoT platform. Comparison of all security parameters with existing literature shows that the architecture is reasonably efficient in terms of security.

AB The Bitcoin protocol, based on a peer-to-peer network enables transactions and blocks to be propagated to all the nodes in a decentralized manner. The information is verified and stored across the nodes as a distributed data ledger, the Blockchain. A node can have a maximum of 8 outgoing connections. The selection of outgoing connections are carried out in a random manner and information is broadcasted to these nodes by flooding. Transaction propagation delays in the network results in temporary inconsistencies in the ledger information resulting in blockchain forks. These can lead to possible double spending attacks. This paper addresses the issue of transaction propagation delay in the network. We present a simulation model of Bitcoin network. The effect of varying the number of outgoing connections and its implication in propagation delay is analyzed to determine the optimum limit of outgoing connections. Further, the idea of selection of nodes based on combination of two parameters, proximity to the sending node and random selection and its effect on transaction propagation delay is explored. Simulation results prove that this method further decreases transaction propagation delay.

AB Since most of the organizations are going online these days, such organizations have become dependent to their data over the internet. Hence, it has become more critical to secure data by taking adequate security measures. One of the measures that can be taken to secure data from attackers and intruders is access control. Along with the changing trend, even the data used is evolving. 'Bitcoin' is the new data that has gained importance in the market. Every third person in the world has Bitcoin to their share. So it becomes important to secure Bitcoin and the information it possesses. Blockchain helps in preventing Bitcoin - the digital currency and therefore stores the information securely. In this paper, we survey and study how the rising of Blockchain technology has affected traditional transactional banking and also outline possible directions for future research.

AB The Blockchain is evolving as one of the most promising and resourceful technologies of cloud infrastructure security. Blockchain is meant to store, read and validate transactions in a distributed database system. It has the ability to enhance security and confidentiality through undisputable shared distributed ledger on cloud nodes. Tampering of Blockchain is enormously thought-provoking due to the use of cryptographic data structures. In this paper we present Blockchain and compare the various platforms on which blockchain can be implemented. The paper illustrates the use of Blockchain applications for building secure infrastructure of cloud computing.

AB The paper is aimed at a very accurate topic which is problematic of cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of this most important cryptocurrency to serve as full-value money. The matter of the first chapter is introducing the Bitcoin concept including its characters and history. In this phase, we are thinking about Bitcoin as a commodity. The analysis of cryptocurrency Bitcoin within currency relations framework is subject for next chapter. Each commodity, which has a role of money, must fulfil three criteria. This commodity must be convertible, relative stable and liquid. This paper discusses the evaluation of these aspects. Based on the analysis, we can contribute to the question whether bitcoin can be used as full-value money in the future. The paper is not concerned on technical aspects like the algorithm of mining, blockchain technology or account safety.

AB Recently we could see several institutions coming together to create consortium based blockchain networks such as Hyperledger. Although for applications of blockchain such as Bitcoin, Litcoin, etc. the majority-attack might not be a great threat but for consortium based blockchain networks where we could see several institutions such as public, private, government, etc. are collaborating, the majority-attack might just prove to be a prevalent threat if collusion among these institutions takes place. This paper proposes a methodology where we can use intelligent software agents to monitor the activity of stakeholders in the blockchain networks to detect anomaly such as collusion, using supervised machine learning algorithm and algorithmic game theory and stop the majority-attack from taking place.

AB In order to solve the problem of value appreciation and evaluation of pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises, we propose an automatic decision-making value system model. Firstly, by applying blockchain and smart contracts, we design general model and basic technology architecture of automatic decision-making value system. Then, by analyzing the characteristics of the value chain of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, we further construct an automatic decision-making value system model applied in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and propose an index system for enterprise value evaluation based on four dimensions of integration, optimization, control and valueadded satisfaction. Finally, the case explains the application of the value system that can be used in conjunction with the alliance chain, the private chain, the public chain, and the process of enterprise value assessment. The automatic decision value system model can help optimize the enterprise value chain and assess the true value of the enterprise from four aspects: integration, optimization, control, and value-added satisfaction.

AB In this paper, we use the credit mechanism of E-commerce platform to evaluate the transaction subject as user reviews, and evaluate the credit degree of the blockchain nodes based on the consensus algorithm of the consortium blockchain as node reviews, then associate the node credit score consisting of user and node reviews with the transaction cost to substitute the incentive effect of the block reward for ledger maintenance. According to the score-pricing strategy we will introduce later, this incentive method can ameliorate the problem of too concentrated bookkeeping permissions and improve the initiative of the accounting node.

AB Aiming at the problem that consortium blockchains cannot elect a leader peer intelligently against real-time transactions and cannot satisfy the stability requirement of the data trading platform, this paper presents a consortium blockchain dynamic leader election. Based on the consensus protocols of Hyperledger Fabric, a transaction evaluation module calculating user score for each peer is introduced into the consortium blockchain. Peers elect the leader peer of the consortium blockchain according to user score dynamically, which improves the stability and security of reaching a consensus within the data trading platform.

AB Motivated by the recent disruption in shaping industries through blockchain, this paper examines the effect of integrating blockchain and Enterprise Resource Planning systems on the relation among the different parties of the supply chain. For a seamless integration, distributors seek to automate payments with retailers under specific conditions, which can be achieved through smart contracts in a blockchain network. In this paper, we study the utilization of QR codes to handle such cases in the supply chain industry between the distributors and retailers in particular. Then, we analyze the contribution of using blockchain to handle these cases. Furthermore, to emphasize the advantages of blockchain on a supply chain, a prototype is implemented and developed using Hyperledger Composer. This prototype highlights the added value blockchain can have on the relation between the two supply chain parties, while providing additional features to build the needed trust between both parties.<bold> </bold>

AB This paper presents a new approach for avoiding double-spending attacks via the concept of recipient-oriented concepts in private blockchain networks. Together with the concepts of stealth address and masternode at recipient sides, transactional privacy is assured and transaction recipients become active which receive transaction propagation unilaterally. Based on this approach, it can be shown that recipient-oriented method is suggested for preventing the double-spending attacks in this paper. In addition, the proposed method is possible to prevent double spending attacks using the verification time of the recipient and blocking time of the transaction.

AB Energy deficiency and carbon emission are two increasingly grave issues recently. Energy Internet (EI), as a promising solution, has received extensive attentions globally. Among numerous key technologies and practice of EI, vehicle to grid (V2G) provides a feasible solution to reduce the level of demand-supply mismatch by leveraging the bidirectional energytrading capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain and edge computing. First, we develop a consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for V2G. Then, edge computing has been incorporated to improve the successful probability of block creation. The computational resource allocation problem is modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg leader-follower game, and the optimal strategies are obtained by using the backward induction approach. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is validated via numerical results and theoretical analysis.

AB Energy Internet provides important support to power transmission and substation distribution links, security is particularly significant. However, access authentication centralized to the certification center has brought great pressure on computing and communications. In this paper, a distributed authentication scheme for the energy Internet is proposed based on the blockchain technology, which is decentralized and undeniable. A PBFT consensus mechanism is implemented with the Shamir threshold secret sharing mechanism. Experiments show that the scheme can effectively improve the concurrent access efficiency of Energy Internet terminals.

AB As an important part of the smart grid, the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) can provide various auxiliary services for the power grid and promote the use of renewable resources. However, there are various kinds of attacks in the V2G network. Based on consortium blockchain, this paper proposes a cross-domain authentication scheme for the security threat in the V2G network. This paper designs the trust model and the system architecture, and describes the scheme in detail. The signature and authentication of the scheme adopt the SM9 identity-based cryptographic algorithm. This scheme utilizes the fact that block chain technology is not easy to tamper with. It uses a hash algorithm to verify the certificate, reducing the number of public key algorithm signatures and verifications, making the solution efficient and scalable. The introduction of block chain technology provides new ideas and methods for solving the security problems in the Smart Grid.

AB Energy Internet is a major innovation in energy development, it involves the concept of Internet of Things, all the existing energy information (distributed generation, supply, consumption) can be connected through the network, get timely feedback, and select control according to demand. Energy development has undergone a micro-energy network, centralized supply, and then to distributed, decentralized, and to achieve ubiquitous state. Now in the distribution of the need for energy stations, there need to achieve synergy among the distribution energy. The Energy Internet distributed collaboration requires artificial intelligence to support its distribution, and distributed optimization synergy in turn requires a lot of artificial intelligence tools. Blockchain technology, as a distributed and shared database technology, has been applied to the concept of energy Internet because of its centrality, transparency, fairness and openness.

AB In recent years, Electronic Commerce (E-commerce) applications are attracting many users and merchants to conduct their daily business online which includes payment of bills, online banking, buying tickets and purchasing goods etc. E-commerce transaction security is a major concern for E-commerce websites along with its customers. The basic requirements for any E-commerce transaction are privacy, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. In this paper, a transaction processing system (TPS) for E-commerce by using a Blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proof and modified elliptic curve cryptography encryption is proposed. Also a denial of service attack detection model for the E-commerce system is proposed which take care of the DoS attack during E-commerce transactions.

AB The Blockchain is an emerging paradigm that could solve security and trust issues for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. We recently introduced in an IETF draft ("Blockchain Transaction Protocol for Constraint Nodes") the BIoT paradigm, whose main idea is to insert sensor data in blockchain transactions. Because objects are not logically connected to blockchain platforms, controller entities forward all information needed for transaction forgery. Never less in order to generate cryptographic signatures, object needs some trusted computing resources. In previous papers we proposed the Four-Quater Architecture integrating general purpose unit (GPU), radio SoC, sensors/actuators and secure elements including TLS/DTLS stacks. These secure microcontrollers also manage crypto libraries required for blockchain operation. The BIoT concept has four main benefits: publication/duplication of sensors data in public and distributed ledgers, time stamping by the blockchain infrastructure, data authentication, and non repudiation.

AB Publicly Verifiable Randomness has many useful and interesting applications in e-voting, distributed cryptography, secure multiparty computation, lotteries, sports seeding and many more. While the output of a Publicly Verifiable Randomness is provably unpredictable for a strong adversary, it is expected that its closeness to a uniform distribution is verifiable for any party. The inherent randomness in public blockchains such as Bitcoin has been the topic of several research papers and been used in lotteries and other multi-party protocols. However, recently it has been argued that an adversary can have a significant impact on the probability distribution of the output with much lower financial cost. Here, in this paper, we propose a new scheme based on the properties of Verifiable Secret Sharing protocols and Threshold Cryptosystems, that uses semi-trusted third parties to improve the security of Verifiable Public Randomness from any public blockchain. We argue that a successful attack against our scheme to impose a bias on a single bit of the output randomness requires not only a significant financial cost but also a corruption of more than k out of n trusted delegates.

TI A Scale-out Blockchain for Value Transfer with Spontaneous Sharding

AB Bitcoin, as well as many of its successors, require the whole transaction record to be reliably acquired by all nodes to prevent double-spending. Recently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput by letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However, these schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance.
   In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a necessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value transfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer ledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition for the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic database. Then, we introduce the blockchain structure with a shared main chain for consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions. A locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity and consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the transactions needed to show that their transactions are not double spend. As a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the transaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call "spontaneous sharding".

AB Today, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the powerhouse of data generation with their ever-increasing numbers and widespread penetration. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions are getting integrated to all kinds of services, making products significantly more "smarter". The centerpiece of these technologies is "data". IoT device vendors should be able keep up with the increased throughput and come up with new business models. On the other hand, AI/ML solutions will produce better results if training data is diverse and plentiful.
   In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based, decentralized and trustless data marketplace where IoT device vendors and AI/ML solution providers may interact and collaborate. By facilitating a transparent data exchange platform, access to consented data will be democratized and the variety of services targeting end-users will increase. Proposed data marketplace is implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and Swarm is used as the distributed storage platform.

AB Existing permissionless blockchain solutions rely on peer-to-peer propagation mechanisms, where nodes in a network transfer transaction they received to their neighbors. Unfortunately, there is no explicit incentive for such transaction propagation. Therefore, existing propagation mechanisms will not be sustainable in a fully decentralized blockchain with rational nodes. In this work, we formally define the problem of incentivizing nodes for transaction propagation. We propose an incentive mechanism where each node involved in the propagation of a transaction receives a share of the transaction fee. We also show that our proposal is Sybil-proof. Furthermore, we combine the incentive mechanism with smart routing to reduce the communication and storage costs at the same time. The proposed routing mechanism reduces the redundant transaction propagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path length. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus protocol where the round leader who creates the transaction block is known in advance. Note that our routing mechanism is a generic one and can be adopted independently from the incentive mechanism.

AB Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain systems, have in recent years emerged as promising platforms for machine-to-machine commerce and other forms of multi-stakeholder applications. However, despite the potential demonstrated by projects such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric, the disk space typically required to host a copy of a ledger may be prohibitively large for many categories of devices. In this paper, we introduce an approach for reducing ledger size in blockchain systems, based on arbitrary pruning predicate functions, allowing each network participant to independently select and remove any already applied transactions. We also show that if only pruning certain ledger transactions, the ability to derive an unmodified state data structure from the remaining transactions is maintained. The approach is validated through a supply chain use case utilizing a modified version of Hyperledger Fabric, in which ledger size is reduced by about 84.49% via selective transaction pruning.

AB The article presents the architecture of communication protocol for modern industrial processes and business based on cyber-physical systems - Industry 4.0. The main attention is paid to one of the key trends of this concept -to economical autonomous agents i. e. to robots or smart things, which are able to make decisions independently about their economic actions. Agents begin to fully participate in business processes, so it is important to automate the processes and ensure formal and secure communication between multiple heterogeneous agents, taking into account the economic component of the industry. The article shows how to organize economic interaction between agents using a peer-to-peer network based on decentralized Blockchain technology and smart contracts. The general concept of protocol work is described and the experience of its implementation on ROS and Ethereum Blockchain is presented in the form of universal software for different agents. As a result, the experience of applying this solution in various projects is described: a business project with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and an educational project of "smart city".

AB Blockchain is being praised as a technological innovation which allows to revolutionize how society trades and interacts. This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency.
   In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.

AB This research addresses the issue that in-depth programming knowhow is needed to read and write smart contracts. The goal was making the creation of smart contracts accessible to non-computer experts by the use of a graphical programming language (Blockly). We used modularization to capture the complexity of legal contracts and developed a mapping process to transform the graphical representation to the smart contract programming language Solidity. We applied our approach to legal purchase agreements and proved the practicality of our solution and explored its limitations. A prototype was built to show the feasibility of our approach. Our industry partner challenged the prototype by applying it to the contract creation process. We consider our work as the first step towards an application of smart contracts in the non-IT world and outside the today's expert shaped ecosystem of blockchain specialists. Several continuative research questions have been derived from our finding and are listed at the end of this paper.

AB Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned ledger platform designed to be highly modular and extensible, delivering confidentiality, privacy and scalability to enterprise blockchains. With Fabric's production grade availability in mid-2017, enterprises are experimenting with Fabric for building real-world blockchain applications.
   In this paper, we characterize the performance and scalability features of the current production release of Fabric (v1.0). This paper takes an experimental approach, where we study the throughput and latency characteristics of Fabric by subjecting it to different sets of workloads. Through a suite of micro-benchmarks, custom-built for Fabric, we tune different transaction and chaincode parameters and study how they affect transaction latencies. Finally, we also conduct experiments to study Fabric's performance characteristics while increasing the number of chaincodes, channels and peers.

AB Soon after its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by cyber-criminals, which rely on its pseudonymity to implement virtually untraceable scams. One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.

AB We describe a general attack on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains without checkpointing. Our attack leverages transaction fees, the ability to treat transactions "out of context," and the standard longest chain rule to completely dominate a blockchain. The attack grows in power with the number of honest transactions and the stake held by the adversary, and can be launched by an adversary controlling any constant fraction of the stake.
   With the present statistical profile of blockchain protocols, the attack can be launched given a few years of prior blockchain operation; hence it is within the realm of feasibility for PoS protocols. Most importantly, it demonstrates how closely transaction fees and rewards are coupled with the security properties of PoS protocols. More broadly, our attack must be reflected and countered in any future PoS design that avoids checkpointing, as well as any effort to remove checkpointing from existing protocols. We describe several mechanisms for protecting against the attack that include context-sensitivity of transactions and chain density statistics.

AB In Bitcoin, the most common kind of transactions is in the form "Bob pays Alice", and it is based on the Pay toPublic Key Hash (P2PKH) script. P2PKH transactions are just one among many standard classes: a transaction is standard if it passes BitcoinCore's IsStandard() and IsStandardTx() tests. However, the creation of ad-hoc scripts to lock (and unlock) transactions allows for also generating non-standard transactions, which can be nevertheless broadcast and mined as well. In this work, we explore the Bitcoin block-chain with the purpose to analyse and classify standard and non-standard transactions, understanding how much the standard behaviour is respected.

AB Blockchain and Internet of Things are supposed to have big impact on logistics. This study presents a prototypical smart contract using smart storage containers in order to investigate the potential and the maturity of Blockchain and Internet of Things for logistical processes. A smart storage container is developed and connected to an Ethereum-based smart contract. The smart contract is based on a multi signature wallet of three parties to process the payment and arbitrate disagreements. Further research implications for the development of smart contracts for supply chains are derived from the experiences of this prototype study.

AB Bitcoin provides freshness properties by forming a blockchain where each block is associated with its timestamp and the previous block. Due to these properties, the Bitcoin protocol is being used as a decentralized, trusted, and secure timestamping service. Although Bitcoin participants which create new blocks cannot modify their order, they can manipulate timestamps almost undetected. This undermines the Bitcoin protocol as a reliable timestamping service. In particular, a newcomer that synchronizes the entire blockchain has a little guarantee about timestamps of all blocks.
   In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that increases the reliability of Bitcoin timestamps. Our protocol can provide evidence that a block was created within a certain time range. The protocol is efficient, backward compatible, and surprisingly, currently deployed SSL/TLS servers can act as reference time sources. The protocol has many applications and can be used for detecting various attacks against the Bitcoin protocol.

AB Bitcoin allows anyone to store small amounts of data on its blockchain as part of a transaction. The data stored become part of the history of Bitcoin's blockchain, which after some time, becomes very tamper resistant, an attribute that many applications find of great use, e.g. document notary systems, asset meta-protocols, etc. However, many use cases require the functionality to revoke (cancel the validity) of the stored data. Previous attempts to handle revocation were not adequate. Since tamper resistance is a default attribute one needs a nonsystemic approach to deal with revocation, which usually implies additional infrastructure to accomplish it. This paper reviews several revocation methodologies together with advantages and disadvantages for each one, as well as proposes a simple and clean solution for revocation without any additional infrastructure or third-party dependencies.

AB Bitcoin blockchain is growing big, yet its transaction capacity hit its limits in 2017. One solution heavily discussed within the bitcoin community is to let it grow faster by increasing size of the blocks. However, making transactions smaller instead of blocks bigger is more sustainable and also brings other additional benefits. In this paper, we focus on space wasted by non-cryptographic use of hashes and uncompressed numbers within transaction inputs. In our analyses, we show that transactions can be made approximately 16% smaller, depending on their complexity.

AB Nowadays, blockchain is seen as one of the main technological innovations. Many applications can rely on the blockchain to secure their exchanges. However, applications with private interest cannot rely on public blockchains. First, in a public blockchain, anyone can read the whole data of the blockchain. Second, anyone can participate to the "consensus process"; the process for determining the validity of each transaction. Consortium and fully private blockchains aim to combine forcefulness of blockchains with controlled consensus process and stricter permissions for deploying a node and joining the blockchain network. In both consortium and fully private blockchains, the number of peers on the blockchain network is very small in comparison with public blockchain. Nonetheless, by targeting the nodes of blockchains, an attacker can easily manage the whole blockchain and takes control of the consensus process to validate his illegitimate transactions. In this paper, to defend blockchain nodes from DNS amplification attacks, we propose a scalable and proactive solution in the context of software defined networks (SDN), named ChainSecure. ChainSecure consists of 3 schemes: (1) StateMap, a novel stateful mapping scheme (SMS) to perform a mapping one-to-one between DNS request and response; (2) Entropy calculation scheme (ECS) to measure the disorder / randomness of data using sFlow in order to detect illegitimate flows; (3) DNS DDoS Mitigation (DDM) module to effectively mitigate illegitimate DNS requests. The experimental results show that ChainSecure protects blockchain nodes and can detect/mitigate the attack quickly to achieve high accuracy in detecting illegitimate DNS traffic making it a promising solution to protect blockchain nodes from DNS amplification attacks.

AB The fifth generation of mobile networks is rapidly evolving, fueled by the ever-growing mobile traffic over recent years. Ultra-reliable and low latency provisioning of services with ranging contextual parameters mapped to highly fluctuating levels of quality of service and quality of user experience, render the optimum operation point of the future networks unsustainable. Network coding is emerging once more as a potential key enabler for optimizing bandwidth requirements and energy consumption in highly dense mobile network environments. Nonetheless, network coding deployments still need to consider security vulnerabilities and their countermeasures, before they can be adapted as part of the emerging mobile network deployments. This paper studies the performance of random linear network coding for wireless mobile networks with an emphasis on pollution attacks while proposing a novel blockchain based message authentication scheme in order to minimize delays and signalling costs.

AB The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has opened up plethora of opportunities for smart networking and connected applications. The large distribution of IoT devices within a finite geographical area and the pervasiveness of wireless networking presents an opportunity for such devices to collaborate. This paper proposes the idea of opportunistic collaboration among mobile IoT devices to share their services and excess computing resources. Opportunistic collaboration among devices over wireless networking requires proper coordination and agreements among the devices in a purely distributed manner. To facilitate the distributive collaboration, we propose a decentralized architecture design using blockchain technology. Through experimental evaluation of a prototype collaborative mobile-IoT system involving RaspberryPis and a Dell IoT edge gateway, we show that our proposed distributed collaborative approach is feasible and comparable to a non-collaborative edge- computing approach from a latency perspective.

DE Blockchain service; double-spending attack; cyber-insurance; game theory
AB Benefit from the capabilities of providing decentralized tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven autonomous organization, open-access blockchains based on proofof-work protocols have gained tremendous popularity. Yet, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols under threats, e.g., double-spending. In this paper, by adopting the cyber-insurance as an economic tool to neutralize cyber risks, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. The blockchain service market under our consideration is composed of four entities, i.e., the infrastructure provider, blockchain provider, cyber-insurer, and users. The blockchain provider purchases the computing resources, e.g., a cloud, from the infrastructure provider to maintain the blockchain consensus and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain provider optimize its profit by strategizing its investment in the infrastructure in order to improve the security of the blockchain and the service price charged to the users. In the meantime, to prevent the potential damage incurred by the attacks and then fully secure the cyber-space, the blockchain provider purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service and will pay the claim to the blockchain provider once attacks happen. Based on the rationality of the market entities, we model the interaction among the blockchain provider, users, and cyber-insurer as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Specifically, the blockchain provider and cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies in the upper level subgame, and then the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service in the lower level subgame. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.

AB In data sharing schemes, the file owners should obtain rewards by sharing files with others as they put energy in these files. Therefore, we proposed an incentive data sharing scheme in this paper which encourages users to share data and also supports customization. Customization allows the owners to decide the threshold of access, the importance of each attributive classification which determines users' priority level of file modification and file ownership obtaining when the original owner leaves according to the priority level value. To support a convincing customized data sharing scheme, we introduce the knowledge of blockchain and construct a suitable access structure based on weighted attributes. The blockchain is used to ensure the fairness in incentive. Based on weighted attributes, an attribute set is disposed to a numerical value and the owner of the attribute set is able to obtain the file when the value is not less than the threshold, which is different from the normal access control policy. We prove the security from integrity, privacy and the availability of access key. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated at the end of this paper.

AB Traditional centralized PKIs are vulnerable due to the single point of failure. A feasible solution is to build a decentralized PKI without certificate authority (CA). Web of Trust is the first step toward realizing a decentralized PKI, but it still has some limitations such as missing incentive and leaking user's privacy. Blockchain's numerous desirable properties, such as cryptographical security, decentralized nature and unalterable transaction record, make it a suitable tool to implement a decentralized PKI. However, the latest research findings about blockchain-based PKI are still incompatible with the thin-clients which have limited storage ability to download the entire blockchain. To combat that, we firstly present a Privacy-preserving Thin-client Scheme (PTS) utilizing the idea of k-anonymity, which enables thin-clients to run normally as full node users and protect user's privacy simultaneously. After that, in order to reduce cost, we further propose an Efficient Privacy-preserving Thin-client Scheme (EPTS) employing the method of PIR (private information retrieval). Then security analysis and functional comparison are performed to demonstrate the high security and comprehensive functionality of EPTS compared with existing schemes. Finally, extensive experiments are undertaken to confirm that EPTS can reduce computational cost and communication cost impressively.

ID SCHEME
AB Electronic medical record (EMR) is a crucial form of healthcare data, currently drawing a lot of attention. Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacypreserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CPABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.

AB By bringing computing capabilities to the network edge, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technique to enable low-latency video streaming services. However, due to the rapid growth of the number of devices and the heterogeneous formats of the video streams, the traditionally centralized content delivery schemes are insufficient to provide secure, adaptive video services with low complexity. To achieve a decentralized content market among untruthful parties (e.g., users and operators), in this paper, we propose an effective video transcoding and delivery approach based on MEC and blockchain. In the proposed approach, we envision a set of blockchain-based smart contracts to build an autonomous content delivery market, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. Then, users, small base stations (SBSs), and content provider (CP) are able to autonomously adjust their strategies according to the content market statistics. Moreover, we formulate the optimization problem, including resource allocation, determining content price and quality levels of contents, as a three-stage Stackelberg game. We analyze the subgame equilibrium for each stage and the interplays of the three-stage game. Lastly, an iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the solution. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, we propose an access control solution for exchanging Blockchain-based Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) called BBACS (Block-based Access Control Scheme) that includes an access model and an access scheme. Unlike the existing Blockchain-oriented access schemes for EMRs, our access model can omit the agent layer (gateway) in order to authorise users' access with block level granularity, whilst maintaining compatibility with the underlying Blockchain data structure. Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms presented in BBACS dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence cut down the cost of network construction and improve the computational performance. We validated the efficiency (time cost) of local computation and data transmission (over Wi-Fi) for BBACS using a simulation of BBACS against another Blockchain-oriented access control scheme for EMRs called HDG as our baseline. To the best of our knowledge, BBACS is the first Blockchain-oriented access control solution without the need for an agent (or gateway) design, supporting granular authorisation (block level), that has been proposed for secure EMRs management in eHealth.

AB Blockchain is core technology for cryptocurrency and it is possible to become fundamental platform for industry and business. Especially, a blockchain-based digital asset transfer system using Internet of Things (IoT) products has recently been considered as a new practical platform, but the protocol limits performance. Previous research has improved performance by proposing new protocols, but further improvement is necessary for dealing with increasing transactions via IoT products. Therefore, we propose an in-Network Interface Card (in-NIC) processing approach using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to improve performance of a blockchain-based transfer system. To be more concrete, we design and implement a prototype NIC with a key-value data store written in a P4 language on the FPGA that has four 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) network interfaces. The prototype system supports frequently-used commands (CREATE, ISSUE, TRANSFER and REFER) for transferring digital asset. It reduces time for processing a kernel network protocol stack and accessing the data store. In fact, we measured throughput and latency of our prototype system compared to those of a blockchain software application. As a result, we found that our solution is able to obtain throughput 6.04 times higher on average and latency 15.4 times lower on average for all typical blockchain operations.

DE Blockchain; Anomaly detection; GPU
AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger system composed of a P2P network and is used for a wide range of applications, such as international remittance, inter-individual transactions, and asset conservation. In Blockchain systems, tamper resistance is enhanced by the property of transaction that cannot be changed or deleted by everyone including the creator of the transaction. However, this property also becomes a problem that unintended transaction created by miss operation or secret key theft cannot be corrected later. Due to this problem, once an illegal transaction such as theft occurs, the damage will expand. To suppress the damage, we need countermeasures, such as detecting illegal transaction at high speed and correcting the transaction before approval. However, abnormality detection in the Blockchain at high speed is computationally heavy, because we need to repeat the detection process using various feature quantities and the feature extractions become overhead. In this paper, to accelerate abnormality detection, we propose to cache transaction information necessary for extracting feature in GPU device memory and perform both feature extraction and abnormality detection in the GPU. We employ abnormality detection using K-means algorithm based on the conditional features. When the number of users is one million and the number of transactions is 100 millions, our proposed method achieves 37.1 times faster than CPU processing method and 16.1 times faster than GPU processing method that does not perform feature extraction on the GPU.

DE Blockchain; Fog Computing; Computation Offloading
AB With the development of mobile computing technology, there has higher demand for computation resource in mobile applications than before. Fog computing has emerged as a promising infrastructure to provide elastic resources at the proximity of mobile users. Mobile users can offload some computations from the mobile devices to the nearby Fog servers so as to release the workloads of mobile devices, and therefore improve mobile users' quality of experience. However, mobile users may mistakenly offload their computations to the nearby Fog servers which have been injected by some attackers, and therefore induce some privacy and security issues. As most of mobile devices have natural mobility feature, it is very necessary to check the veracity of a Fog server in a very short time before doing computation offloading. In view of this challenge, we bring blockchain technique into Fog environment so as to verify each Fog server's authenticity and propose a blockchain-based offloading approach in this paper. Concretely, the proposed approach constantly maintains a set of candidate authorized Fog servers by leveraging blockchain technology, and the offloading decision could be made in a real-time fashion. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated our method's feasibility and efficiency.

AB In this article, we present designs for a Multi Winner Proof of Work (MWPoW) consensus primitive. MWPoW is a consensus protocol that places the group mining idea directly into a protocol to prevent power centralization, higher general reward expectation among participants and shorten the interval time of block generation. It makes every miner a component of one of three groups assigned by the network, not as an individual competitor; all users in the winner group receive compensation. The hash difficulty is higher than ordinary blockchain because there are only three parties in the system. MWPoW powered block-chain is more secure from tampering. The blocks can be quickly final accepted without later block confirms, which makes it possible for block interval time to be minuteness. The experiment suggests the hash rate of MWPoW is around 1500 times larger than Nakamoto blockchain while it only requires about 1 second to finally accept a block in the lab environment (with 3-second block interval). MWPoW is universal profitable (the mining remuneration is much more distributed than Nakamoto block-chain).

This paper proposes a blockchain based online trading system for DDoS mitigation services, which enables a victim network to on-demand purchase DDoS mitigation services close to the attack sources. The blockchain provides a trust infrastructure for the victim network to find optimal remote service providers, and a sophisticated credit system to evaluate the credibility of players in the system.

AB in the world of internet of things, social media, and cloud computing, blockchain is the latest addition to the technology. The swift development of blockchain and its respected applications has made it a force to be recognized. But the scope of blockchain is not limited to bitcoin or the cryptocurrencies implementation. This paper enlightens the stipulation of blockchain beyond the bitcoin. Furthermore, this paper reveals the insights of blockchain technology concepts, evolution, mechanisms and challenges based on literature review. This paper identified the complications or challenges in implementation of blockchain technology in real-world applications. Secure implementation of blockchain technology on small scale applications is the key problem that still need to be addressed. The proposed consensus mechanism would be useful for secure implementation of the blockchain on small-scale application or projects.

AB Securities exchange being digitalised and online, security of information and data has become a major concern. Blockchain (BC) technology, being distributed and immutable in nature, has proved to the "Trust Machine" eliminating the need for third-parties. Authors of this paper investigate how Blockchain can be used to secure stock exchange transactions, with an especial focus to the technological as well as legal aspects of such applications. Considering the intricate operational structure of the securities exchange, the research proposes to design, develop and implement a hybrid BC, customised according to the need of the respective stock exchange. The study suggests that the use of such BC can bring many benefits which the other technologies currently being used cannot offer. However, during the design process of any such application using BC, the relevant laws and regulations of the corresponding country need to be considered.

AB Surveillance and secrecy breaching incidents of users' privacy questioned the current third-parties data collection procedure. Massive amounts of Personally Identifiable Information (PH) are being exploited due to malpractice, identity theft, spamming, phishing and cyber-espionage. A large amount of data flow from users to enterprises for data-driven market analysis and prediction. Consequently, it is tough to track the flow and genuineness of PII. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger which can efficaciously track PH exchange, store, and distribution. In contrast, ongoing EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'should be erasable' rights. However, this paper proposes an off-chain Blockchain architecture which uses both local database and distributed ledgers to preserve a trustable PH life cycle. Considering the key factors of GDPR, prevailing Blockchain architecture were modified and a prototype was created to validate our proposed architecture using multichain 2.0. Proposed architecture stores PH and Non-PII physically separated location. Finally, with proposed architecture user will realm privacy and rigidity of Blockchain along with the privacy regulation of GDPR. Validation is done by comparing proposed system with existing methodology from technical aspects, future research scopes is also well advocated.

AB Micropayment by WeChat is widely used these days across the world which can be extended to microcommerce. While it can be considered as the essence of a microchain in society, it is also found to enjoy similar characteristics like Huizhou Merchants, such as the way of travelling and the aims for daily uses. The information flow model is presented to account for the profits caused by asymmetry in modern society within blockchain. In contrast, the thermodynamic model with entropy is used to show the profits in the microcommerce, and predicts that a large block chain may not necessarily increase values.

AB Usage of IoT marketplaces as central components in distributed systems have become common, as they allow for easy exploitation of other services and data sources. When relying on a marketplace to be available in order for a system to be operational, it is critical that the marketplace operation is highly robust. Marketplaces are typically centralized components which means that single point of failure is a possible issue. Also users of the marketplace must trust the operator to be fair and follow a common set of rules. This work proposes to utilize blockchain technology to realize a distributed marketplace where both functionalities and storage are distributed and thereby increasing availability to users, while removing the need for a central operator. The blockchain also makes the operational rules transparent to the users of the marketplace. In this relation two core marketplace functionalities, offering creation and discovery, are realized using smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain and evaluated using an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a blockchain based marketplace implementation.

ID SECURITY
AB In a few short years the Internet of Things has become an intrinsic part of everyday life, with connected devices included in products created for homes, cars and even medical equipment. But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks.
   The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from.
   Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited.
   However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data.
   Within this paper a cross section of blockchain consensus protocols have been assessed against a requirement framework, to establish each consensus protocols strengths and weaknesses with respect to their potential implementation in an Internet of Things blockchain environment.

AB As cloud services greatly facilitate file sharing online, there's been a growing awareness of the security challenges brought by outsourcing data to a third party. Traditionally, the centralized management of cloud service provider brings about safety issues because the third party is only semi trusted by clients. Besides, it causes trouble for sharing online data conveniently. In this paper, the blockchain technology is utilized for decentralized safety administration and provide more user-friendly service. Apart from that, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption is introduced as an effective tool to realize fine-grained data access control of the stored files. Meanwhile, the security analysis proves the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the cloud server. Finally, we evaluate the performance of computation overhead of our system.

AB Application services in cloud computing model have complex scheduling, composition, configuration and deployment conditions, even in the multi-condition requirements, it can also be based on the change of time to schedule virtual services. Therefore, the demand of optimizing cloud computing scheduling strategy to ensure cloud data security and recovery ability is increasingly prominent.This paper proposes a trusted distributed audit method for cloud task scheduling, which is used for the trusted storage of cloud task scheduling information in the cloud cluster. This method mainly uses a distributed solution that combines block chain technology and traditional cloud server to solve the problem of integrity and security of cloud task scheduling, in order to prevent potential. The vulnerabilities in the system cause significant losses to the system. The architecture of this paper is composed of four parts: cloud cluster, control system, block chain network, and cloud database. We store the hash data of cloud task scheduling information into blockchain network and store the original data to the cloud data base, which guarantees the cloud task within the cloud cluster. Data security and integrity, and provide a new idea for future research system recovery.

AB With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the surge in data generated by sensors and smart devices has caused data overload in designated centralized data centers. However, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage, cannot afford to manage these gigantic data in the suitable way. Due to the lots of devices and senors continuously creating data, traditional IoT architectures must address many challenges that are not designed to provide trust, security, resiliency, and low latency. To solve theses problems, we propose a decentralized architecture named MicrothingsChain based on blockchain with smart contract, which enables edge computing nodes storing corresponding domain IoT data and interacting with each other safely. It brings computing and storage capabilities to the edge of the IoT network and realizes distributed storage of large amounts of data. Specially, MicrothingsChain adopts publish-subscribe mode, in which users can access the data across domain. Furthermore, we present one cryptographic currency for our ecology named MicroCoin. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that MicrothingsChain is suitable in practice.

AB The application and use of smart contracts in organizations require a holistic overview. This overview helps to understand the current adoption of this technology and also deduces factors that are inhibiting its use in the modern organization. This study provides a systematic review of previous studies comprising of frameworks, methods, working prototypes and simulations that demonstrate the application of smart contracts in organizations. Understanding the current state and usage of smart-contract technology in an organization is a focal point of this paper. Much progress occurs in developing technologies that support smart contracts, while little understanding exists pertaining to their usage in organizations. In this study, we identify properties of smart-contract applications in different domains of modern organizations. We further analyze and categorize challenges and problems mitigating the adoption of smart-contract applications.

AB Through the studying of the status quo of medical industry, we find some problems with the sharing of medical data. The medical data in traditional medical institution is stored on severs and its backup database, resulting in lack of communication among medical institutions and ineffective use of medical resources. In order to solve this problem, we propose a medical information sharing model based on blockchain technology. In this model, we build a p2p network to connect different medical institutions and other nodes. Meanwhile, we establish two associated blockchain to store medical data digests and requests. Each node in the p2p network can search the medical information in the distributed medical institutions. In this way, we have integrated medical data between medical institutions and improved the transparency and sharing of medical data. Also, we improve the traditional POW (power of work) algorithm, by using the double-chain structure, we reduce the confirmation time of a block.

AB It was analysed in a general way and the security problem of the public organizations of Ecuador was determined. The objective is to generate a prototype in a blockchain diagram, based on an algorithm using flowchart techniques to provide robustness against failures, third-party attacks and mitigate information vulnerabilities. The deductive and exploratory research method was used in order to analyse the information available in the medium and scientific articles. Resulted an algorithm developed through flow diagram techniques to improve the processing of information in a public organization in Ecuador from the use of the Blockchain technology and the use of the SHA 256 algorithm. It was concluded that access to the data to a generic public organization of Ecuador will have an alternative to improve the security of the information with the implementation of the blockchain

AB This study aims to present changes that are taking place in the market of logistics services as a result of the development of digital technologies and show their influence on the business models of logistics service providers. In her research, the author applied Porter's 5 forces model as a theoretical framework for the analysis in the area of innovation and technology in logistics. The study uses the deduction method. This is a conceptual paper based on the analysis of secondary materials, i.e., examples of innovative logistics solutions, reports of research agencies and consulting companies, and literature studies. The results of the analysis show that we are dealing with the digital transformation of the logistics service industry (not digital destruction). Technologies like sensors, robots, automation, cloud computing, data analysis, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, digital twins or blockchain technology supplement but not replace the real world of logistics by providing customers with higher logistics service value.

AB Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized environment, where transactions and data are not under the control of any third party organization. Any transaction ever completed is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable, secure, transparent and permanent way, with a timestamp and other details. Introduced in 2009 as the core mechanism for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and its worldwide payment system, blockchain has had many applications in domains such as IoT, finance, business, management, health and education. Also new platforms and tools for blockchain implementation were developed. As education becomes more open, diversified, democratised, and decentralised, the blockchain technology is taken in consideration by researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of learning. In the first part of the paper, we explore the blockchain technology. Next, existing global and governmental initiatives, together with potential applications of blockchain in different domains are presented. The need to learn about this emerging technology is demonstrated, together with pioneering cases in different universities. Then we propose a public blockchain called OpenEduChain, designed as a repository for open educational assets (Open Educational Resources - OERs, Massive Open Online Courses - MOOCs, open pedagogies and scenarios), but also to deliver issued certificates and open badges by universities and other educational and training institutions. At university level, OpenEduChain, implemented on Ethereum, is used to store data about the open educational items created by faculty members and students. Also digital certificates or open badges are provided to the participants in the trainings and workshops. After a period of tests, OpenEduChain usage could be extended at national level, but also for new purposes such as e-portfolios or assessment.

AB Information hollering through electronic links occurs across organizational boundaries with interagency that allow automatic exchange of electronic data between partners in the supply chain. In digital data networks are usually sent by copying them from one place to another, one of the main problems in this case is to verify that the information received from the network is genuine and latest. Blockchain technology is considered to solve the data verification in the data authenticity problem independently, without having to take regardless of who or where the data came from. The application of blockchain fits perfectly with the digital supply chain as it leverages Internet technology as a system that connects all organizations involved in the supply chain. Blockchain consists of a set of data consisting of a chain of data packets where each block consists of several transactions in each block can be validated using cryptographic means, cryptography itself consists of two kinds of cryptographic symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. In this paper the application of blockchain uses cryptographic symmetric with Rijndael 256 algorithm which is famous for its easy resistance, speed and design. the results of discussions using technology and blockchain on the digital supply chain is still a concept of application. From the concepts, the researcher concludes the application of blockchain technology with the data structure can be applied by sharing encryption and can be applied in some cases, such as data verification for face recognition, artificial intelligence or machine learning.

DE Software upgrade; Block chain; Decentralization; IoT
AB Software upgrade is necessary, which can not only get the new software features, but also fix software vulnerabilities to improve security. With the rapid development of Internet of things (IoT), all kinds of smart devices increase sharply, so traditional C/S (client/server)-based software upgrade model is difficult to satisfy the application scenario. In order to guarantee massive terminal software upgrade in secure and efficient way, this paper proposes a novel software upgrade scheme for IoT terminals based on the block chain technology. In the scheme, there exists a variety of terminal devices in the IoT scenario, and each terminal device has a variety of softwares, and each software upgrade record is stored in the block chain by consensus mechanism. Terminal device can query software update record from block chain and download the latest software version from adjacent terminal device in IoT, which can complete software upgrade spontaneously, with the advantage of decentralization. At the same time, the scheme can ensure the timeliness and traceability of software upgrade. This scheme takes advantage of the untamperability of block chain data to guarantee its security and reliability, which provides a new solution for terminal device software upgrade in IoT scenerio.

AB With the development of digital inclusive finance, the deficiency of traditional personal credit system is becoming more and more obvious. In order to make up for its defects, financial science and technology are applied in the field of personal credit investigation, but the credit information sharing is insufficient. The problem of weak protection of personal credit information still exists and needs to be solved urgently. Starting with the necessity of constructing personal credit system based on financial science and technology, this paper reveals the current situation and existing problems of Internet credit investigation and big data credit investigation. Then, the block chain technology is introduced into the personal credit system. The block chain technology with both sharing and security will promote the construction of the new personal credit investigation system. And from the aspects of necessity, solution and significance to inclusive finance, this paper expounds that block chain credit investigation solves the problem of insufficient sharing of credit information and weak protection of personal credit information. Then, on the basis of the positive significance of the application of block chain technology in the field of personal credit, the paper points out the technical bottleneck and potential risks of the application of block chain technology in personal credit system. Finally, the conclusion of this paper and the suggestion of developing personal credit system based on financial science and technology under the perspective of digital inclusive finance are put forward.

TI Developing a Cryptocurrency Assessment Framework: Function over Form
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
ID BITCOIN
AB The rise of cryptocurrency as a new sui generis asset class creates a need for a new classification scheme to cover the wide range of functionality for which tokens can be used. By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a "better" form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token's exchangeability for that asset and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price is considered.

TI Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and How to Protect Against Them
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
ID BOUNDS
AB The key cryptographic protocols used to secure the internet and financial transactions of today are all susceptible to attack by the development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. One particular area at risk is cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 100 billion USD. We investigate the risk posed to Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, by attacks using quantum computers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum, based on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications.

TI Bitcoin Average Dormancy: A Measure of Turnover and Trading Activity
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Attempts to accurately measure the monetary velocity or related properties of Bitcoin have often attempted to either directly apply definitions from traditional macroeconomic theory or to use specialized metrics relative to the properties of the Blockchain such as bitcoin-days destroyed. In this paper, it is demonstrated that beyond being a useful metric, bitcoin-days destroyed has mathematical properties that allow one to calculate the average dormancy (time since last use in a transaction) of the bitcoins used in transactions over a given time period. In addition, transaction volume and average dormancy are shown to have unexpected significance in helping estimate the average size of the pool of traded bitcoins by virtue of the expression Little's Law, though only under limited conditions.

AB We develop EthernityDB, a system that integrates database functionality into an Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to other systems, in our approach all the data is kept on the chain, giving us all the guarantees of a blockchain in terms of consistency, immutability, and security. Mapping the database functionality onto Ethereum's smart contracts is not a straightforward process: by modularizing the code in certain ways, we can bring down the transaction cost considerably. In a experimental evaluation we illustrate various trade-offs, measuring these transaction costs, and also discuss building blockchain-based data storage in a more general context.

AB The increase of data leakages in some of the world's largest companies is leading to a fundamental reassessment about the way data is collected, stocked and seeured, The current model in which a third party manages individually data is starting to reach its limits. The block-chain model, popularized by the Bitcoin in the financial space, is growing and demonstrating that using a decentralized network of peers can lead to a secured and powerful computing. Present paper describes the implementation of a decentralized personal data management system, It ensures users own and control their data. We implement and test he..e a conerete application of the block-chain. It allows our system to avoid the usage of a traditional third-party role by managing an automated access-control system p..ofitable to the user. Finally, we open a discussion on the possibility to set up an economic system based on the exchanges of tokens between the diffe..ent entities ofthe solution.

AB The Bitcoin protocol is a significant milestone in the history of money. However, its adoption is currently constrained by the transaction limits of the system. As the chief problem of block chain technology, the scaling issue has attracted many valuable solutions both on-chain and off-chain.
   In this paper, our goal is to explore the notion of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to propose an augmented Bitcoin protocol that can scale gracefully. Our proposal aims to increase the transaction throughput by partitioning the UTXO space and splitting the block chain. In addition, a new type of Bitcoin node is introduced to preserve the capability to run validating nodes in low-bandwidth environments, despite the increased transaction throughput.

AB Illegal content on a blockchain cannot be removed and the originator might not be identifiable. At the same time, node operators that have no control over the content stored on their nodes might be held legally responsible. As a decentralized system, Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) needs decentralized governance and smart contract dispute resolution. Existing DLT governance and dispute resolution is only aimed at balancing the interests of DLT and smart contract participants. It fails to address the interests of third parties and society. The failure to do so could trigger government and court intervention within DLT systems, Although the decentralized nature of a DLT system will offer some pretection against this intervention, participants might be identifiable and subject to legal presecunon, We present a design also addressing the interests of society and third parties that wiD have to be accompanied by an international legal framework.

AB In recent years, with Bitcoin taking the lead, the blockchain technology has been put in the spotlight as it introduced a method for multiple parties to achieve consensus without trust. Nevertheless, the according application is constrained due to its limitations in scalability. In this paper, we proposed a highly scalable consensus model based on majority voting cellular automata, namely the MOCA consensus, with a distinctive blockchain-based distributed ledger in which the state change of each node depends on its neighbors. MOCA consensus origins from the zero-temperature Ising model with spontaneous magnetization achieving scalability of number of nodes with high probability Byzantine fault tolerance.

AB Cloud service providers offer massive storage space for individuals and enterprises. To guarantee the integrity of outsourced data, a range of data auditing schemes have been proposed. The auditing tasks in these schemes are typically performed by a Third Party Auditor (TPA)responsible for periodically checking the integrity of user data. However, such a centralized auditing framework is vulnerable and as a third party, the auditor cannot be fully trusted. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and smart public auditing scheme for cloud storage, which eliminates the involvement of the TPA and improves the reliability of auditing schemes. We build a protocol for automatic data integrity checking in a decentralized environment based on a smart contract, which eliminates the involvement of data owners and data users. Performance analysis and experiments show that our scheme is efficient and favorable.

AB Blockchain is one of the most heavily invested technologies in recent years. Due to its tamper-proof and decentralization properties, blockchain has become an ideal utility for data storage that is applicable in many real world industrial scenarios. One important scenario is web log, which is treated as sources of technical significance and commercial revenues in major internet companies. In this paper, we illustrate our design of a web log storage system based on HyperLedger. HyperLedger yields higher throughput and lower latency compared with other blockchain systems. Alongside its efficiency advantages., HyperLeger is a permissioned blockchain, which is an ideal fit for enterprise software design scenario.

DE blockchain; consensus; Byzantine protocol
AB With the great success of Bitcoin, the blockchain, as its key underlying teclmology, has been paid more and more concern. However, the Proof-of-Work(PoW) mechanism used by Bitcoin requires long confirmation time and wastes more computing resource. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as another important protocol that has been widely used, which can tolerate at most 1/3 corruptions, meanwhile confirm transactions with quick speed In fact, it is difficult to Implement and maintain it with a large-scale setting. In this paper, considering a permissioned setting, we propose a Byzantine protocol based on the conunittee, and elect a committee to reach the consensus on behalf of all participants. In steady state, our protocol uses PBFT to approve transactions among all members of the conunittee. In election state, we use an efficient election algorithm which can combine the latest consensus results with the partletpants authentication information to elect a new committee. Our protocol improves on Bitcoin in confirmation time and provides safety and Iiveness on the condition of the amount of Byzantine participants are less than 1/3.

AB Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the foundation and core of network security construction. Blockchain (Be) has many technical characteristics, such as decentralization, impossibility of being tampered with and forged, which makes it have incomparable advantages in ensuring information credibility, security, traceability and other aspects of traditional technology. In this paper, a method of constructing PKI certificate system based on permissioned BC is proposed. The problems of multi CA mutual trust, poor certificate configuration efficiency and single point failure in digital certificate system are solved by using the characteristics of BC distribution and non-tampering. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of identity privacy on BC, this paper proposes a privacy-aware PKI system based on permissioned BCs. This system is an anonymous digital certificate publishing scheme, which achieves the separation of user registration and authorization, and has the characteristics of anonymity and conditional traceability, so as to realize to protect user's identity privacy. The system meets the requirements of certificate security and anonymity, reduces the cost of CA construction, operation and maintenance in traditional PKI technology, and improves the efficiency of certificate application and configuration.

AB As a global decentralized distributed ledger, Bitcoin's POW mechanism is so complex that the transaction's confirmation is very time-consuming. If the dust attacks occur in the blockchain, which sends large amounts of dust transactions to the blockchain, the time of transactions' confirmation will be more longer, which will lead to more security problems, such as double-spending or blockchain forks. In order to identify and prevent dust attacks, this paper proposes an innovative Anti-Dust security model, which analyzes the characteristics of dust attacks and learns from the historical transactions big data, uses the Gaussian distribution to construct a dust recognition algorithm. At the same time, a dust transaction pool will be added to improve the blockchain architecture. In the experiment, a large amount of dust transactions will be send to the blockchain. Taking 50000 dust attacks and 500 normal transactions as an example, the conformation time of blockchain without Anti-Dust is about 20000 seconds, and Anti-Dust is about 210 seconds. The results show that Anti-Dust is an effective defense method to identify and prevent the dust attacks.

AB Nowadays, we can enjoy many internet applications including online lotteries and games. The results of lotteries, card games, dice throwing and so on, depend upon the values of random numbers generated under some rules. However, we cannot verify the correctness for the given random numbers, that means, we have no means to convince ourselves that the given random numbers have indeed been correctly generated, using a pre-determined algorithm, and without being intentionally perverted by anyone. We say that such random number generation can provide 'transparency'. It is quite important that random numbers given online can convince us that those are correctly generated. In other words, the transparency of online random number generation is quite important. Sako et. al. [5] have given a random number generation scheme applicable to the game 'Backgammon', in which transparency of blockchain enables us to verify the correctness for used random numbers after the game ended. In that scheme, however, the server has to be a trusted party, and it means dishonest generation of random numbers is possible by making one player and the server corrupted. In this paper, we present a transparent random number generation scheme. To be sure that a few trusted parties appears in the description of the scheme, but by implementing such trusted ones with public blockchain actually operated, our scheme can generate transparent random numbers without requiring any trusted parties.

AB In recent years, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have attracted a great deal of attention from the whole industry including the financial as a new settlement system. Transaction information of these cryptocurrencies is stored in a distribution ledger called Blockchain on the P2P network through processing such as PoW. Meanwhile, since PoW requires a large amount of computer resources, researches on private / consortium type blockchain that do not need PoW. In this paper, we propose a decentralized netting protocol using a consortium type block chain that has the channel function. On a system that implements the proposed protocol, netting settlement can be performed on P2P hiding information of the sender and receiver name of transaction, amount of money, calculation butt of netting, and without setting up a specific central organization such as a central server.

AB While swarm robotics systems are often claimed to be highly fault-tolerant, so far research has limited its attention to safe laboratory settings and has virtually ignored security issues in the presence of Byzantine robots i.e., robots with arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior. However, in many applications one or more Byzantine robots may suffice to let current swarm coordination mechanisms fail with unpredictable or disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we provide a proof-of-concept for managing security issues in swarm robotics systems via blockchain technology. Our approach uses decentralized programs executed via blockchain technology (blockchain-based smart contracts) to establish secure swarm coordination mechanisms and to identify and exclude Byzantine swarm members. We studied the performance of our blockchain-based approach in a collective decision-making scenario both in the presence and absence of Byzantine robots and compared our results to those obtained with an existing collective decision approach. The results show a clear advantage of the blockchain approach when Byzantine robots are part of the swarm.

DE Distributed Ledger Technology; Blockchain; Shareholder Rights
AB We study and develop an automated platform for shareholder rights management using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), in collaboration with an equity crowdfunding company. DLT has high impact potential for the multi-agent systems domain, as it allows participants to agree on the values of shared variables and keep a history of how the values change over time. DLT also enables participants to know that the shared values are common knowledge. In our application, the shared variables that the agents agree on are the shareholder rights. Knowing that there is common agreement on these rights allows us to develop related applications, such as a shareholder voting system. In this paper, we discuss the shareholder rights management platform and briefly mention a related shareholder voting system, both currently under development.

AB The water companies should provide services at the affordable tariffs for all people, irrespective of the water source, geographical area, size or complexity of water supply system. In order to contribute to the sustainability of water distribution infrastructure, tariffs should cover, in practice, at least the operating and maintenance costs. To obtain a lower water tariff, the water-energy nexus should be take into account. Thus, developing the innovative technological solutions which to allow new water pricing options and policy actions based on energy efficiency measures and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to implement the EU water policy represent a new research direction. The paper proposes an innovative solution represented by a software platform for a sustainable management of water supply systems which to include the advanced ICT solutions (Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence) and smart concepts (smart metering, demand response) with benefits both energy and water fields. The platform could lead to realize significant energy and savings through technical measures and a smart management, supplying the consumers with quality water at an affordable tariff considering the socio-economic factors.

AB The potential of WSN related to the IoT concept is immense. According to a Cisco study the IoT will merge with other engineering areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), fog computing and blockchain technologies, creating new business opportunities. Two main directions for solving the main issues of M2M communications can be distinguished: the use of frequency band division ultra-narrow band (UNB) communications and the use of a spread spectrum technique. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the LoRaWAN communication protocol. At the same time, the main features and mechanisms of communication are presented in detail by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the communication mechanism. From the obtained test results, we can conclude that high-density wireless sensor networks can be implemented using LoRa communication. The stars-of-stars network topology is scalable and offers the possibility to integrate a large number of nodes.

AB Within the "Industrie 4.0" approach, 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classicly branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB This paper proposes a platform that transfers electric power among consumers individually using digital grid technology that can digitally control power and blockchain technology. In this platform, each individual estimates excess or shortage of electric power based on each amount of their electricity consumption and generation, then the consumers conduct power trading at the electric power market made with blockchain. Finally, the consumers conduct power interchange based on the trading result.

AB Recently, there has been growing interest in the field of cloud manufacturing (CM) amongst researchers in the manufacturing community. Cloud manufacturing is a customer-driven manufacturing model that was inspired by cloud computing, and its major objective was to provide ubiquitous on-demand access to services. However, the current CM architecture suffers from problems that are associated with a centralized based industrial network framework and third part operation. In a nutshell, centralized networking has had issues with flexibility, efficiency, availability, and security. Therefore, this paper aims to tackle these problems by introducing an ongoing project to a decentralized network architecture for cloud manufacturing which is based on the blockchain technology. In essence, this research paper introduces the blockchain technology as a decentralized peer to peer network for multiple cloud manufacturing providers.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming the norm in both civilian and military settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security abstraction layer for IoT systems based on blockchain, which provides us a logical view of a system that comprises trusted devices. The goal of the proposed layer is to detect and isolate untrusted devices. The proposed abstraction layer provides three services, namely: authorization, authentication, and auditing by using blockchain and smart contract-based approaches. We adopt a hardware-based approach, where dedicated hardware modules are used to monitor the behavior of the firmware without incurring excessive performance overhead.

AB Advancements in sensors and devices have enabled Internet of Things (IoT) adoption in various sectors, especially in domains looking to automate and increase their real-time decision making capabilities to improve efficiencies. Supply chain management in logistics is a perfect fit for adoption of IoT, since it involves shipment of assets being moved, tracked and housed by a number of machines, vehicles and people each day. Smart Contracts are terms and conditions parties can specify that assure trust in the enforceability of the contract and provide visibility at every step of a supply chain. IoT devices can write to a smart contract as a product moves from the factory floor to the store shelves, providing real-time visibility of an enterprises entire supply chain. This paper proposes a smart logistics solution encapsulating smart contracts, logistics planner and condition monitoring of the assets in the Supply Chain Management area. A prototype of the solution is implemented which demonstrates accountability, traceability and liability for asset handling across the supply chain by various parties involved in a logistics scenario.

AB This paper proposes a scheme to use blockchain technology for rideshare services. This paper replaces the centralized authority that matches drivers and riders, with block chain and a matching application that uses two types of coins, which encourages the drivers turning into miners. To evaluate the proposed system, this paper applies the proposed blockchain rideshare service to a case study to simulate and find the least matching probability to make drivers benefit from this system. Furthermore, this paper establishes a mathematical model of the stationary distribution of drivers and calculate the stationary profit of each driver in the blockchain rideshare system.

DE blockchain technology; philanthropy; logistics; social welfare
AB Focusing on the overlapping areas of the logistics industry with a large number of mature blockchain applications and the public welfare industry that requires high transparency and credibility, this paper designs and implements an innovative philanthropy logistics platform based on blockchain technology through the Ethereum platform. Our platform makes use of the open, transparent, and irrevocable features of the blockchain, combined with a unique Responsibility Relay System and Evaluation and Reporting Mechanism, and can achieve the consistency of the data on the chain with real-world status, as well as the authenticity and transparency of philanthropy logistics data. This paper also establishes a model for evaluating philanthropy material donations for social welfare based on the classic network maximum flow algorithm. After four months of empirical analysis, we have concluded that the blockchain platform can greatly increase the user's trust in the project, enhance the system's cleanliness coefficient and increase the quality of philanthropically raised materials, thereby improving the public welfare of charitable donations. The paper draws the conclusion that this blockchain platform is a technical solution for maximizing social welfare.

AB The existing data sharing models have some issues such as poor transparency of data transactions, data without security assurance and lacking of effective data tracking methods. This paper proposed a brand-new data sharing scheme based on blockchain technology. Firstly, a blockchain double-chain structure about blockchain was introduced, one chain was used to store the original data and another was used to store transaction data generated by transactions. This structure separated the original data storage and data transactions. Secondly, combined with proxy reencryption technology, safe and reliable data sharing were achieved. Finally, a new design was implemented. The logical structure of data transaction records enables data to be traced. The results of correctness and security analysis showed that this scheme can provide new technical ideas and methods for big data sharing and data trace.

AB The Cryptography is the way to secure the personal information in the 21st century. Nowadays a big challenge is the approach to the quantum computational power which it will be the end for the actual cryptosystems. In the public key ciphers the modulo operation is the core because the Euclid algorithm will increase the computational power needed by the eavesdropper. It seams that the new direction on the internet architecture, blockchain, can be a valuable direction for the public key cryptography survival. Here, a new idea on generating hashes will be introduced by using chaotic behaviour and statistical independence.

AB Blockchain technology opens up new opportunities for Business Process Management. This is mainly due to its unprecedented capability to let transactions be automatically executed and recorded by Smart Contracts in multi-peer environments, in a decentralised fashion and without central authoritative players to govern the workflow. In this way, blockchains also provide traceability. Traceability of information plays a pivotal role particularly in those supply chains where multiple parties are involved and rigorous criteria must be fulfilled to lead to a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate how to run a business process in the context of a supply chain on a blockchain infrastructure so as to provide full traceability of its run-time enactment. Our approach retrieves information to trace process instances execution solely from the transactions written on-chain. To do so, hash-codes are reverse-engineered based on the Solidity Smart Contract encoding of the generating process. We show the results of our investigation by means of an implemented software prototype, with a case study on the reportedly challenging context of the pharmaceutical supply chain.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN; INFORMATION
AB Supply chain management is hampered by a lack of information sharing among partners. Information is not shared as organizations in the supply chain do not have direct contact and/or do not want to share competitive and privacy sensitive information. In addition, companies are often part of multiple supply chains and trading partners vary over time. Blockchains are distributed ledgers in which all parties in a network can have access to data under certain conditions. Private blockchains can be used to support parties in making their demand data directly available to all other parties in their supply chain. These parties can use this data to improve their planning and reduce the bullwhip effect. However, the transparency that blockchain technology offers makes it more difficult to protect sensitive data. The dynamics between these properties are not well understood. In this paper, we design and evaluate a blockchain architecture to explore its feasibility for reducing information asymmetry, while at the same time protecting sensitive data. We found that blockchain technology can allow parties to balance their need for inventory management with their need for flexibility for changing partners. However, measures to protect sensitive data lead either to reduced information, or to reduced speed by which the information can be accessed.

AB With the inclusion of network interfaces always connected to embedded systems, the concept of Internet of Things emerges. Today, IoT devices are in virtually all human activities facilitating the quality of life of people. Despite the advantages of these devices, there are also some drawbacks, one of the main ones being cyber security. One of the technologies currently in vogue to mitigate cyber security problems is blockchain. The overall blockchain approach is to be implemented on the server side, where computing capabilities are not as limited as in embedded systems. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the blockchain technologies. To evaluate the proposed methodology a comparative study of various blockchain technologies that can be implemented in embedded systems particularly for use in smart meters with SBC Raspberry Pi has been conducted. The results show that lightweight implementations of Blockchains are better for embedded systems.

AB This paper proposes a JPEG-blockchain framework for trusted media transaction. The new distributed and tamper-proof framework intends to aid an emerging JPEG Privacy and Security standard. The blockchain network records any media transaction with necessary information related to intellectual property rights, access control rules and content signature. The content signature, generated by compressed sensed samples or low-resolution, low bit-rate compression is used to verify the image integrity and authenticity. We propose that every blockchian record, linked to a unique transaction hash, is encapsulated within the metadata contained in the JPEG box structure. As an example use case we have chosen the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) sector due to its emerging need. This paper presents the proof of the concept and reports preliminary infrastructural development.

DE Forensics; Cybercrime; Attack; Investigation
AB The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose FIF-IoT-a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. FIF-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and store them securely as transactions in a public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Hence, FIF-IoT eliminates a single entity's control over the evidence storage, avoids single-point-of-failure on the storage media, and ensures high availability of evidence. FIF-IoT presents a framework that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public digital ledger. Furthermore, FIF-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and to verify the integrity of the obtained evidence. We present a case study of a forensic investigation to demonstrate that FIF-IoT is secure against evidence tampering. We also implement a prototype to evaluate the performance of FIF-IoT.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing exponential scalability. This scalability introduces new challenges regarding management of IoT networks. The question that emerges is how we can trust the constrained infrastructure that shortly is expected to be formed by millions of 'things.' The answer is not to trust. This research introduces Amatista, a blockchain-based middleware for management in IoT. Amatista presents a novel zero-trust hierarchical mining process that allows validating the infrastructure and transactions at different levels of trust. This research evaluates Amatista on Edison Arduino Boards.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is inspired by network interconnectedness of humans, objects, and cloud services to facilitate new use cases and new business models across multiple enterprise domains including healthcare. This creates the need for continuous data streaming in IoT architectures which are mainly designed following the broadcast model. As more devices communicate with each other via the Internet, it will be crucial to determine the origins of requests and responses. Being able to store records related to the life cycle of requests and responses in an immutable form will provide documentary evidence that will help to establish transparency and accountability within the IoT. Previous works employed provenance techniques to address this problem but focus on the request perspective. However, little or nothing has been done regarding the response perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes and develops a blockchain-based provenance system to trace bi-directionally the sources of requests and responses in the IoT. This is achieved through the investigation of historical communication records. Several empirical evaluations are conducted in a real-world IoT ecosystem to prove the superiority of the proposed work.

ID FACE RECOGNITION
AB Identity Management (IDM) in cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications is critical in many businesses. However, most conventional IDM systems are costly and hinder the innovation and greater customer experience. By using blockchain, a new way of managing the identities is proposed. This paper presents an initiative to improve IDM by integrating face recognition approach and blockchain technology in an integrated IoT-cloud application. To illustrate the proposed initiative, a decentralized campus wide printing service is chosen as a use case. In this use case, face recognition is used as an entry point to the service. Since face recognition involves a lot of complex computations and machine learning, this process is executed on a cloudlet, hence minimizing the need for massive data transfer to a distant cloud. Once a user's login information is digitally verified via immutable blockchain, smart contract is deployed to keep track of the user's printing activities. The integration of blockchain in this service has decentralized the IDM, automated the service, and kept the service inexpensive and transparent.

AB Blockchain technology is currently emerging as the next promising revolutionary technology. Many different applications have started to venture into this technology. The decentralization and distribution nature of blockchain allows dynamic applications to be build on it, including Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. IoT devices have been commonly linked to smart systems with its applications mainly surrounding on event detection and monitoring. Coupling this IoT capabilities with blockchain network offers great potential for scalable event detection and monitoring for large-scale network. Nevertheless, detection mechanism should be able to scale up with such requirements. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework on implementation of distributed pattern recognition for event monitoring within IoT-blockchain network. This conceptual framework is supported by a preliminary study on IoT-blockchain implementation and distributed pattern recognition implementation using a Graph Neuron (GN) approach.

AB Access control is a crucial part of a system's security, restricting what actions users can perform on resources. Therefore, access control is a core component when dealing with eHealth data and resources, discriminating which is available for a certain party. We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are prone to system's and network's faults and do not assure the integrity of policies life-cycle. By approaching this problem with a blockchain where the operations are stored as transactions, we can ensure that the different facilities have knowledge about all the parts that can act over the eHealth resources while maintaining integrity, auditability, and authenticity.

DE Block Chain; Drug Addicts Management; File Management; Data Security and
   Sharing
AB The public security departments, government agencies and community departments in China should carry out daily supervision and assistance to drug addicts listed in the control. But the responsibility distinction is not clear in the actual work. So it brings low control efficiency, resulting in the lack of file data, data authenticity and other problems. Block chain has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, autonomy, information cannot be altered, cannot be forged and so on. It is superior to centralized database in data security and data sharing. This paper designs a file management system for drug addicts 'management based on block chain, which can effectively guarantee the security and authenticity of data, and realize the sharing of data in the public security industry. It can provide real data reference for the public security organs on the level of drug addicts management and control, and improve the mode of drug addicts management and control.

DE PHRs; proxy re-encryption; cryptography; hyperledger; data sharing
AB The blockchain systems are analyzed under the context of the personal health record system (PHRs) requirements. The transparent property of blockchain may cause the privacy and confidentiality concerns for PHRs. The append-only storage of blockchain can be a barrier for implementing the revocability of consent in PHRs. Moreover, the health care data can be very large exceeding the practical storage capabilities of the current blockchain usages. The most important issues of blockchain include the limited storage, privacy, consent revocation, performance, energy consumption and scalability. A blockchain based secret-data sharing model is proposed by using a proxy re-encryption technique to support the PHRs in this work. Some potential attacks which can attempt on the proposed model and how the model can handle such attempts is also discussed.

AB Over the last couple of years, Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the Blockchain technology that forms the basis of Bitcoin have witnessed an unprecedented attention. Designed to facilitate a secure distributed platform without central regulation, Blockchain is heralded as a novel paradigm that will be as powerful as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning.
   The Blockchain technology garners an ever increasing interest of researchers in various domains that benefit from scalable cooperation among trust-less parties. As Blockchain data analytics further proliferates, a need to glean successful approaches and to disseminate them among a diverse body of data scientists became a critical task. As an inter-disciplinary team of researchers, our aim is to fill this vital role.
   In this tutorial, we offer a holistic view on Blockchain Data Analytics. Starting with the core components of Blockchain, we will discuss the state of art in Blockchain data analytics for graph, security, finance, and management domains. We will share tutorial notes and further reading pointers on the tutorial website blockchaintutorial.github.io.

AB One of the biggest problems plaguing society today is that of fraudulent elections. The world's largest democracies still suffer from flawed electoral systems. In current voting systems, we see problems with vote rigging, hacking of the EVM (Electronic voting machine), election manipulation, and polling booth capturing. Looking closely at the current Cambridge Analytica scandal brings the validity of current voting systems into question. In this paper, we propose a novel voting model which can resolve these issues. Using a recently introduced blockchain protocol called PHANTOM, we try to alleviate known problems in voting systems. Furthermore, the advantage of using our model is, it is compatible with all voting schemes. So, one can implement our model using any voting scheme depending on the requirement of different type of elections.

AB With the rapid development of information and communication technology, a vast amount of personal health data is generated, stored, and utilized in healthcare related services. However, there are many issues remained to be solved, such as data interoperability, security, and privacy concerns. On the other hand, blockchain, a decentralized peer-to-peer digital ledger, has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as a promising technology to protect privacy of personal data. By adopting blockchain, individuals can take advantage of personal health data for better healthcare. In this paper, after briefly summarizing the major features of blockchain, we describe blockchain-empowered solutions for utilization of personal health data in healthcare and discuss issues and challenges. We further propose i-Blockchain, an individual-centric framework for use of personal health data based on an extension of permissioned blockchain, present the basic architecture and protocols, and show several application scenarios.

AB now blockchain network is used in many areas such as healthcare, energy trading. However, the research about how to evaluate the performance of the blockchain network is insufficient. In some papers, the performance of blockchain is analyzed by running real blockchain applications. However, the devices and services cost is a burden. In this paper, we aim to use continuoustime Markov chain (CTMC) models to simulate the time response of PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)-based healthcare blockchain network. Some influencing factors such as replica nodes delay and primary node delay will be analyzed. The simulation results also contribute to the optimization design of blockchain network.

DE online quiz; Consortium Blockchain; Double-layer chain; group signature
AB The students' online quiz is a way to realize the informatization and modernization of higher education. To solve the problem that the scoring process is non-transparent, injustice and the final results are easy to be changed, an online quiz scheme based on Double-layer Consortium Blockchain is proposed. The scheme achieves the public verification of students' answers and the answer records cannot be tampered with but can be traced. Besides, group signature is used to solve the problem of anonymous abuse in blockchain applications. In addition, the storage pressure of sub-chains' nodes can be further reduced by adding the prime-chain's index to the sub-chains.

TI Blockchain, Chain of Custody and Trace Elements: An Overview of Tracking

DT Article
ID LA-ICP-MS; DIAMOND; DESIGN; LUXURY; ORIGIN; TRUTH
AB Recent developments have brought due diligence, along with tracking and traceability,to the forefront of discussions and requirements in the diamond, coloured stone and pearl industries. This is a result of consumer demands for detailed information on the provenance of gems, banking requirements aiming to reduce risk, industry and company initiatives seeking to bring greater transparency, and ;rowing government legislation on mineral supply chains. To address this trend, certification mechanisms and technologies (such as blockchain) are being developed to solve inherent traceability challenges. As applied to gems, such standards and associated technology could benefit from the support of existing gemmological approaches (e.g. geographical origin determination) to enhance traceability Ind transparency measures. Recent initiatives are not just limited to corporate social responsibility reporting and due diligence requirements, but they also embrace supply chain management ',including quality control and process improvements) -for example, to correctly identify and disclose treated and synthetic materials throughout the jewellery industry-as well as address consumer demand for provenance information. This article provides an overview of current trends and developments in the tracking and traceability of gems, along with an explanation of the terms Bed in this context.

AB The energy consumption of fast growing blockchain mining industy should be considered as opportunity esspecially for renewable sources. Possible limitation of feed-in tariffs or electrical energy exported into the grid often challenge existence of distributed biogeneration. Since, electrical energy cost had crucial influence on feasibility of cryptocurrencies minings, presented paper suggest definition of levelized cost of Bitcoin. However, participation in mining activity request higher efficiency of electrical energy generation. Combined heat and power plants can perform in trigeneration mode and this will enhance total energy performance for mining farms due to reduction of energy consumption far mining rigs cooling.

AB Blockchain technologies, such as smart contracts, present a unique interface for machine-to-machine communication that provides a secure, append-only record that can be shared without trust and without a central administrator. We study the possibilities and limitations of using smart contracts for machine-to-machine communication by designing, implementing, and evaluating AGasP, an application for automated gasoline purchases. We find that using smart contracts allows us to directly address the challenges of transparency, longevity, and trust in IoT applications. However, real-world applications using smart contracts must address their important trade-offs, such as performance, privacy, and the challenge of ensuring they are written correctly.

TI SCRaaPS: X.509 Certificate Revocation Using the Blockchain-based Scrybe

AB X.509 certificates underpin the security of the Internet economy, notably secure web servers, and they need to be revoked promptly and reliably once they are compromised. The original revocation method specified in the X.509 standard, to distribute certificate revocation lists (CRLs), is both old and untrustworthy. CRLs are susceptible to attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle and Denial of Service. The newer Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and OCSP-stapling approaches have well-known drawbacks as well.
   The primary contribution of this paper is Secure Revocation as a Peer Service (SCRaaPS). SCRaaPS is an alternative, reliable way to support X.509 certificate revocation via the Scrybe secure provenance system. The blockchain support of Scrybe enables the creation of a durable, reliable revocation service that can withstand Denial-of-Service attacks and ensures non-repudiation of certificates revoked. We provide cross-CA-revocation information and address the additional problem of intermediate-certificate revocation with the knock-on effects on certificates derived thereof.
   A Cuckoo filter provides quick, communication-free testing by servers and browsers against our current revocation list (with no false negatives). A further contribution of this work is that the revocation service can fit in as a drop-in replacement for OCSP-stapling with superior performance and coverage both for servers and browsers. Potential revocation indicated by our Cuckoo filter is backed up by rigorous service query to eliminate false positives. Cuckoo filter parameters are also stored in our blockchain to provide open access to this algorithmic option for detection.
   We describe the advantages of using a blockchain-based system and, in particular, the approach to distributed ledger technology and lightweight mining enabled by Scrybe, which was designed with secure provenance in mind.

AB With the rise of cryptographic ransomware, Bitcoin has found a niche as the standard currency for ransoms. While Bitcoin is pseudonymous, it provides no guarantee of untraceability. As a result, another niche has arisen Bitcoin money laundering. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have previously been used in a number of applications where traditional pattern recognition falls short. In this paper, HMMs are inferred from transactions in the public blockchain in an attempt to link users, events, and enterprises. We introduce a proof-of-concept algorithm to infer HMMs from the Bitcoin blockchain.

AB With the popularity of cloud storage, how to verify the integrity of data on the cloud has become a challenging problem. Traditional verification framework involves the Third Party Auditors (TPAs) which are not entirely credible. In this paper, we present a framework for blockchain-based data integrity verification in P2P cloud storage, making verification more open, transparent, and auditable. In this framework, we present Merkle trees for data integrity verification, and analyze the system performance under different Merkle trees structures. Furthermore, we develop rational sampling strategies to make sampling verification more effective. Moreover, we discuss the optimal sample size to tradeoff the conflict between verification overhead and verification precision, and suggest two efficient algorithms of order of verification. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the schemes of our framework. The experimental results show that our schemes can effectively improve the performance of data integrity verification.

DE consortium blockchain; consensus; Byzantine fault-tolerance; reputation
   model; primary change
AB The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm (PBFT) has been highly applied in consortium blockchain systems, however, this kind of consensus algorithm can hardly identify and remove faulty nodes in time, and also vulnerable to many attacks against the primary node of PBFT. The equality of consortium members' discourse rights is inapplicable to some real scenarios where dominating members are likely to have a larger discourse rights in the voting process.
   To address these problems, this paper presents Reputation based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT) algorithm that incorporates a reputation model to evaluate the operations of each node in the consensus process. The faulty nodes will get lower discourse rights in the voting process if any malicious behavior is detected, with their reputation decreased. Furthermore, this paper presents an innovative reputation-based primary change scheme. The node with higher reputation obtains greater opportunities to be a primary to generate new valid blocks, which reduces the security risk of the primary.
   The experimental results demonstrate that RBFT gains better performance and ensures system security and reliability. Compared with PBFT, it increases the average throughput by 15% and reduces delay by 10%, and the faulty node rate of the system can continue to decrease over time.

AB Blockchain technology and its applications have played an important role to overcome challenges in numerous areas of the life. However, most current blockchain projects have concentrated on financial model by using existing platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to generate tokens without the development of the technological features. Unfortunately, the decentralization has several challenges which cannot be adopted by our current political, economic and social systems. The fundamental technical problem of current blockchain algorithm is that 'performance inefficiency' could not be solved, in comparison with the central server system. In addition, the client software cannot establish conventions for making decisions about the future direction of the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, users' completed anonymity and the absence of a responsible person are also open problems of decentralization. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative method, dubbed RCANE which is semi centralized network of parallel blockchain and APoS (Authorized Proof of Stake), whose purpose is to solve the above challenges of current blockchain and comply with our preconceived perspectives of the current political, social, and economic systems to build up an ecosystem for economy, society and politics. Several experiments are conducted to show the executability of RCANE Project.

AB Blockchain technology is emerging in various fields, to guarantee security of digital currency and internet of things. In this paper, we provide incentive to encourage edge servers to serve mobile users for the mobile blockchain application. We formulate the problem as a resource allocation problem, then we propose a three-stage auction to implement resource allocation specially designed for mobile blockchain, and introduce the group-buying mechanism to motivate mobile users. We prove that our auction scheme is truthful, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. We compare proposed scheme with TACD and HAF mechanisms, and simulation results show that the social welfare achieved by our scheme is higher than that of TACD and HAF mechanisms.

ID PRIVACY
AB Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards this purpose, we describe the key architectural concepts, including fault tolerance, and show the trade-off between market efficiency and resource requirements.

ID CENTRALITY
AB Off-chain transaction handling like the Lightning Network (LN) is among the most promising solutions to solve the scaling challenges in blockchain technology like Bitcoin. At the same time, the LN faces its own challenges like transaction path lengths, centralization of channels (hubs), channel imbalances (depletion), etc. Here we study the effects of payment channel fees on these various factors. To get realistic insights, we based our study on empirical Bitcoin transaction patterns and existing LN structure, and apply a simple form of fee structure with only one tunable parameter, a, that is most influential on the transaction routing paths. We assume the transactions through the LN take the path of the lowest aggregate fees, and found as a consequence that one cannot have short average path lengths and low overall channel imbalances at the same time. A good compromise is to have fees proportional to the square root of the channel capacity, such that reasonably short path lengths and overall balanced channel capacities can be achieved that makes the operation of the LN more sustainable.

AB Evolvement of blockchain technology has greatly changed the network and it makes many applications to be distributed, decentralized without loss of security. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that provides a runtime environment for running smart contracts, which is called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum-based applications are usually referred to as Decentralized Applications (DApps), since they are based on the decentralized EVM, and its smart contracts. Meanwhile, distributed data store also evolves fast with the blockchain technology. Distributed storage develops to reduce the cost of the server side hardware and increase data availability. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol for distributed storage. IPFS stores immutable data, remove duplication, and obtain address information for storage nodes to search for files in the network. Many DApps have been created with the use of these technologies and one example is to use this design for a decentralized Twitter-like system that is resistant to censorship and single point of failure. This paper involves researching the blockchain technology and implementing a decentralised social network application on the Ethereum private blockchain with the use of smart contract and IPFS. In addition, it examines how blockchain and distributed storage can enable more functionalities of traditional social network systems.

DE Private blockchain; consensus algorithm; Byzantine fault tolerance
AB In this paper, we focus on the design of consensus algorithms for permission-based blockchains, i.e., private blockchains. In most consensus algorithms, blocks are proposed by a specific role called "leader". hi this paper, we introduce a new role called "witness" to supervise the leader. The presence of the witness facilitates the design of the consensus algorithm. We propose a witness-based consensus algorithm that guarantees safety and liveness. We implemented this consensus algorithm on Go Ethereum. The experimental result shows that in a blockchain where four nodes participate in the consensus process, we can achieve a throughput of 1000 transactions per second (TPS). Even if these four nodes are located on different continents, and one of them is faulty, we can still achieve a throughput of 300 TPS. Finally, we find that during the experiment, a significant portion of time (>50%) is spent on activities other than the consensus task. The result suggests that to further increase the throughput of a private blockchain, the consensus task and non-consensus activities should be considered jointly.

DE access control; blockchain; healthcare; medical data; privacy and
   security
AB With the development of information and storage technologies, electronic document recording has become an unalterable trend, which transforms the way that people store, access and operate the data generated in various applications. Healthcare is the leader application domain that pioneers in usage of electronic medical records (EMRs). Cross-organizational EMRs' sharing has many constructive effects in motivating the domain innovation, introducing better domain understanding and overall the domain intelligence. However, the privacy concern, trust issue as well as the sophisticated legal regulation of the sensitive EMRs' use leads to inefficiency in the data sharing process. In this paper, we propose a cross-organizational medical data sharing framework based on permissioned blockchain technology, named "EMRShare", to resolve the trust concern existing in EMRs sharing practice among different participants like patients, clinicians and researchers, and other relevant parties such as the insurance agent and govermnent, to make medical data sharing and access secure, efficient, transparent, immutable, traceable and auditable. A working prototype system is implemented to demonstrate the key features for the cross-organizational medical data sharing and access management. The objective of this work targets at explaining the essential design considerations along with the working principle and operation logics using the blockchain technology to facilitate the medical data sharing in a highly-cooperative healthcare ecosystem.

AB Blockchain is first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and developers all around the world have been trying to apply blockchain in different areas, like finance services, credit and ownership management, resource sharing, investment management, Internet of Things (IoT) etc. Ethereum is a Blockchain 2.0 platform that allows developers to build a Decentralized Application (DApp) without building a new blockchain from the scratch. IoT is the technology to embed all the physical devices with sensors and chips to provide automation process via machine to -machine communication. Blynk is a platform that provides iOS and Android application for the users and developers to collect data from control microcontroller. This paper is aiming to build a system with Ethereum private Blockchain, Raspberry Pi (RPi), Blynk platform, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors. The system is a proof-of-concept prototype to simulate smart home applications. It collects the real-time room temperature and humidity by DHT11 via Raspberry Pi. The sensor data will be updated to the Blynk App and stored on the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum private Blockchain. If the real-time temperature or humidity value exceeds the threshold value set by the users, red or green LEDs will be turned on as warnings. This system can be improved by some possible future work.

ID TRUST
AB Blockchain is a new decentralized and distributed network applying technologies such as P2P network, cryptography and so on, in which P2P lays the foundation. Various consensus mechanisms, which correspond to trust models in P2P, solve the trust problems caused due to the anonymity of nodes. In addition, different incentive models are established in the P2P and blockchain network to encourage nodes to share resources subjectively, thereby improving the contribution of nodes to the system. Based on the analysis of trust and incentive models in P2P, this paper summarizes the consensus and incentive mechanisms of blockchain network. What's more, we indicate the future prospects in blockchain including the improvement of blockchain derived from P2P, the idea of a coin free blockchain, the problems faced by blockchain, issues about blockchain storage and blockchain application scenarios, which will provide guidance for the future study of blockchain network.

AB As it was mostly developed in a non-academic context, the literature on the blockchain often lacks of mathematical rigour. Therefore, fundamental computational problems of this new technology such as consensus, Byzantine fault tolerance and self-stabilization can not be fully looked into. In this work we use the principles of distributed computing to introduce a topological structure with the purpose of facilitating the study of the blockchain. Our model exploits classical topological tools used in the context of distributed systems to describe the evolution of a blockchain. Different assumptions on the input assignments, number of generated blocks and latency of the system are considered in our analysis. Furthermore, we define a probabilistic structure to enrich our model and to add also a predictive capability.

AB Innovations such as the Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics have already dramatically altered the customer experience in many, if not all, industries. Blockchain, as another emerging technology, is expected to be the next generation infrastructure to established trusted multi-party collaborations. In this paper, we investigated the convergence of aforementioned technologies, by presenting a prototype of fine-grained transportation insurance. Insurance premium were assessed based on vehicle's usage and driver's behavior, which were deduced from streaming IoT data collected from mobile sensors. This incentive mechanism promotes fairness among drivers and encourages safer driving style. The prototype takes advantage of both private blockchain (e.g., high transaction rate in Hyperledger) and public blockchain (e.g., inbuilt cryptocurrency). Besides system architecture and implementation details, preliminary performance evaluations are presented and discussed.

DE Data Trading; JointCloud Computing; blockchain
AB JointCloud computing is a new generation cloud computing model based on collaboration among Cloud Service Providers, making resources from multiple clouds deeply integrated, and supporting customize cloud service. To achieve the data confirmation Right when doing data trading to prevent resell is one of the most important challenges faced by such JointCloud environment. In this paper, we propose the JointCloud Computing Data Trading Architecture (JCDTA), an optimized data trading architecture for cross-stakeholder. Firstly, the announced mechanism is used to extract the data resources summary and the owner information into blockchain. Secondly, the untampering of the blockchain is used to record the data resources information, such as data resources statement information, data resources transaction records and data resources operation records. Finally, the supervision mechanism confirms the declaration of the data sources while the encryption technology ensures the privacy of the data resources. JCDTA guarantees the security and the reliability of data trading in the JointCloud environment and ensures the value invariance of data resources.

DE CyberGIS; edge computing; Block Chain; Web Crawler
AB With the development of geographic information system, digital earth and digital city play more and more important roles in life. The data generated by sensors or other edge nodes need to be collected by crawlers in the distributed systems in IoT, such as the GIS data in CyberGIS. In some edge networks, network operators have adopted methods to limit crawlers, such as blocking the request IP addresses, requiring logging in verification codes and other measures to avoid disturbance to servers. To collect data from web servers in these types of edge networks, a dynamic IP address based strategy DP-crawler is proposed to solve the anti-crawler strategies in the edge networks. DP-crawler can dynamic get proper IP addresses from a security-aware list and select the best available proxies. The security-aware list is designed to use the block-chain. Security and dynamic storage can be achieved by this method. DP-crawler is used to crawler webs, and the detailed information of Douban movies are obtained in the experiments. The experiment results show that the DP-Crawler can get more information by using the DP-Crawler.

AB this paper focuses on the performance evaluation of consensus algorithms used in a blockchain system for Internet of Things (IoT). In such systems the time necessary to achieve consensus should be small. Three most used consensus algorithms (modified proof of work, practical byzantine fault tolerance and binary consensus) are evaluated in different situations - type of motes, number of nodes participating in consensus algorithm and radio propagation model. An integrated solution is proposed to adapt an IoT node to different consensus algorithm. The simulations in Contiki IoT operating system show good performance (time to achieve consensus less than seconds)

ID CONSUMPTION
AB The sharing economy is an emerging research field. The form of sharing economy that is emerged by using many information technologies such as the mobile Internet, the big data, the cloud computing, the block chain, etc. profoundly influences and changes the traditional economic form of human society with the emerging economic formats in the information age. Under the background of the new era, clarifying the basic connotation, performance characteristics and main functions of the sharing economy can attach a great significance on better promoting the high-quality development of the sharing economy and building a modern economic system. It is believed in this article that the connotation of the sharing economy can be grasped from the scope of development, motivation, ideas and models. The sharing economy has the characteristics of rapid development, diversified subjects, clear operating mechanism and differences in economic composition. We then derive 9 variables with almost equal importance which reflect the development of sharing economy through Factor Analysis. The development of sharing economy has entered a new era. While promoting the development of shared economy, we should promote the deep integration of new and old formats, foster the sharing of information and cultural genes, build a pragmatic and invasive system, apply an inclusive and prudent regulatory system, and create a social environment of joint construction and sharing. This article helps to deepen the understanding of the sharing economy and has certain reference value for theoretical research and practical development in this field.

AB Global payment systems powered by blockchain technology through various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethreum are growing rapidly providing public access to its database. The technology eliminates the need for a central authority like bank to control the data. Instead, verification and integrity of data are provided through cryptographic techniques. Bitcoin is not a monetary generated by a government. Analyzing the public dataset and exploring its statistical property can uncover some hidden facts in cryptocurrency and the blockchain protocol. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey. First is to provide an up-to-date literature survey on Bitcoin transaction analysis, and second is to understand the hidden facts that could be revealed by analyzing Bitcoin transactions. To provide a comprehensive survey, we categorize existing analysis based on anonymity, user behavior, wealth accumulation and currency rate prediction. Analyzing the Bitcoin transactions can help to understand it from a broader perspective that can help investors in decision making.

AB The emergence of blockchain technology has created a frenzy and a mind shift for organizations and industries. Governments and international bodies are increasingly discussing the potential implications of blockchain's distributed ledgers on business, governments and the economy. The intended purpose of the blockchain technology is to connect business network members in a decentralized way. The technology enables exchange and sharing of information without the involvement of intermediaries acting as arbitrators. Powered by its decentralized nature, the network will not have any single point of failure and will not rely on any single entity. Hence, blockchain eliminates the risks of centralization. This paper discusses a scenario of a blockchain technology in distributed ledgers to manage a well function and secure supply chain.

AB Processes in the insurance economy are often cumbersome and expensive because of the inherently opposing interests of insurers and customers. Smart contracts bear a large potential to simplify these processes and thereby reduce costs. In this paper, we present CAIPY, our smart contract-based ecosystem for simple and transparent car insurance. In CAIPY, smart contracts do not replace but support current processes to enable significant cost savings, e.g., by removing the necessity for manual inspection of insurance claims in presence of tamper resistant car sensors. However, the involved parties can resort to well-established processes at any time, trading off cost efficiency against process reliability. CAIPY thus showcases how smart contracts can support insurers without introducing new risks.

AB The emergence of distributed ledger technologies in the vehicular applications' arena is decisively contributing to their improvement and shaping of the public opinion about their future. The Tangle is a technology at its infancy, but showing enormous potential to become a key solution by addressing several of the blockchain's limitations. This paper focuses on the use of the Tangle to improve the security of both in-vehicle and off-vehicle functions in vehicular applications. To this end, key operational performance parameters are identified, evaluated and discussed with emphasis on their limitations and potential impact in future vehicular applications.

   attack
AB IOTA is a novel cryptocurrency that uses distributed ledger technology based on directed acyclic graph data structure. Security of cryptocurrencies ought to be scrutinized in order to acquire esteemed security, attain trust, and accomplish indelible adoption. Although IOTA proffer resilient security controls, IOTA security is not yet well explored. Among all the propounded IOTA vulnerabilities that have been identified, we pragmatically exploit replay attack against IOTA. We further analyze the attack to perceive its impact. Attack methodology and proof of concept for the replay attack is presented. Our proposed exploitation methodology is based upon address reuse, while IOTA in default mode does not reuse addresses. Distrust, and privation of balance can be some of the severe impacts of this vulnerability.

AB Blockchains and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are a much-proposed solution for an Internet of Things (IoT) payment platform. Because of their decentralized networks, they are one of the few technologies which allow for true Machine-to-Machine financial transactions, considered essential for the IoT economy. In this paper, we examine the issues surrounding IoT payment systems, including their requirements and proposed specifications. We will also discuss limitations of blockchains to meet these specific requirements, and whether other DLTs or possible optimization solutions for blockchains can overcome these limitations. We present example IoT payment implementations using DLTs to illustrate the opportunities surrounding this technology. This paper aims to capture the breadth and depth of this topic to understand why IoT payment systems are essential to the IoT economy and how blockchains might provide the answer for implementing them in an effective manner.

AB Nowadays, a combination between Internet of Things (IoT) technology and remote healthcare system is extensively researched due to its efficiency and convenience for human life. When the number of IoT devices in health care system is increased exponentially, the privacy and security issues of patients are becoming a concern. In order to protect personal and device-generated information, we propose to use blockchain-based smart contracts for managing patients' information and medical devices. In detail, using blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we create a remote healthcare system including healthcare provider (such as hospital), healthcare professionals (doctors) and patients. Health condition of patients is measured by sensors and such information is written into blockchain automatically. In addition, we propose a processing mechanism to store the medical device information efficiently and sparingly in accordance with health situation of patient. Concretely, we filter the data from sensors before deciding whether to write data into blockchain or not. Doing so we can reduce the size of blockchain as well as save amount of coins for transaction efficiently. However, the abnormal data from sensors will be written to blockchain immediately and trigger an emergency contact to doctor and hospital for on-time treatment. We have verified the proposed smart contract on Ethereum test environment called TESTRPC and implemented the system on an experimental environment with real devices. This system works well at small scale.

AB Video transcoding has been widely applied in video streaming industry to convert videos into multiple formats for heterogeneous users. To provide fast and reliable transcoding services, some emerging platforms are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology to build decentralized transcoding hubs with flexible monetization mechanisms, where any users can rent their idle computing resources to become transcoders in order to receive reward. On these blockchain-enabled platforms, transcoder selection together with resource allocation is a crucial but challenging issue, which should maximize the transcoding revenue to motivate the transcoder candidates as well as handling the dynamic quality of service (QoS) requirements and candidates' characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based transcoder selection framework for blockchain-enabled video streaming. Specifically, we propose an evaluation mechanism to facilitate transcoder selection, and design the transcoder selection and resource allocation scheme using the DRL approach. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

DE Software defined Industrial Internet of things; multiple controllers;
   permissioned blockchain; Byzantine fault tolerance; dueling deep
   Q-learning
AB Recently, rapid advances in information and communications technologies (ICTs) have improved the performance of software-defined industrial Internet of things (SDIIoT). Due to a variety of data, flows and smart devices in SDIIoT, a distributed SDN control plane is necessary. However, how to achieve consensus among controllers efficiently and safely is an intractable problem. In this paper, we use a permissioned blockchain approach to reach consensus in distributed SDIIoT. Since lots of data needs to be synchronized, and the throughput of traditional Byzantine fault tolerance protocol used in permissioned blockchain is limited by many aspects, i.e., the trust features of nodes in blockchain, the trust features of controllers in distributed SDIIoT, and the computing capacity of blockchain, we jointly consider these aspects to improve the throughput of permissioned blockchain. Accordingly, we formulate view change, access selection, and computing resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. This joint problem is highly dimensional, and is hard to be solved by traditional methods. Therefore, we propose a dueling deep Q-learning approach to address the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

AB Recent proliferation in disruptive technologies has opened up a new horizon for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The success of IoV highly depends on the robustness of vehicular information system as a dispute among the service providers on data rights or any kind of security violation could disrupt the transport services altogether. In this work we propose a blockchain based novel architecture for vehicle authentication and privacy preservation with seamless access control for IoV. Proposed architecture is decentralized, robust and scalable. Along with privacy preserving authentication and conflict-free access-log maintenance, the proposed BlockAPP protocol also supports an optional traceability feature. Performance evaluation using smart contact over Ethereum Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

AB Conventional Key Management Protocols establish secure communication channels by using asymmetric cryptography based on "fixed" public keys. In the Internet of Things context, it is preferable to have a good level of freshness of the cryptographic material. But efficient solutions leveraging "ephemeral" public keys are not available yet. The work presented herein solves this problem by conceiving a novel key agreement methodology integrating the Blockchain technology. Specifically, Blockchain is used to store X.509 certificates related to the initial fixed public keys of devices, to publish new ephemeral public keys, and to help the verification of the authenticity of ephemeral public keys without sending signatures and additional X.509 certificates. A preliminary comparison against Transport Layer Security protocol and other customized key agreement schema presented in the literature demonstrates that the proposed approach registers low communication overhead, limited energy consumptions, and acceptable communication latencies while ensuring the lowest memory footprint.

AB In the present era of smart cities and homes, the private information of the patients such as their names, address, and disease is being breached on a regular basis, which indirectly related to the security of electronic health records (EHRs). The existing state-of-the-art schemes handling the security of EHRs have resulted in data being generally inaccessible to patients. These schemes struggle in providing the efficient balance between the data privacy, need for patients, and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology resolves the aforementioned issues because it shares the data in a decentralized and transactional fashion. This can be leveraged in the healthcare sector to maintain the balance between privacy and accessibility of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based framework for efficient storage and maintenance of EHRs. This further provides the secure and efficient access to medical data by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the patient private information. The goals of this paper are to analyze how our proposed framework fulfills the needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework maintains the privacy and security concerns in the healthcare 4.0.

AB The study integrates blockchain technology which treats each mobile database as a block Each block will first detect its own range of sensor data. The system then concatenates the sensor data for each block through the blockchain technology. In addition to their own measurement data, these concatenated sensor data also contain all the sensor data of the previous block Therefore, when the system completes the connection of each block, each block node stores the sensor data of the entire wireless network Mobile database is placed in an embedded hardware module like the Raspberry Pi. This module also establishes web server at the same time. The setting of this mobile web server is based on the Web of Things (WoT) structure. The advantage of this mobile database is easy information collection, while maintaining confidentiality and security. This mobile web server can draw figures with multiple chart types on the web page whilst delivering these web pages of charts to the cloud. The mobile web server is also built on the same embedded hardware module, and even the system can be a private cloud data center. The proposed system will visualize the data uploaded by these sensors and draw the relevant chart after performing big data analysis. This web page server of the system is built on an embedded operating system so that it is easy for the system to model and visualize the corresponding graphics using the Python or JavaScript programming language.

AB In comparing Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, we analyze whether these can become a viable alternative to fiat currencies. In the theoretical part we assess if these embody the main functions of a currency (Krugman, 1984). The empirical part analyzes the price development, liquidity and velocity of Bitcoin in comparison to the major other cryptocurrencies in 2017. We conclude that Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that evolved during a hard fork of Bitcoin, may develop into sharing features of a global currency. Currently cryptocurrencies are rather tokens and a highly volatile asset class of their own.

AB Blockchain is a disruptive technology with the potential to have a significant impact on business models and industries, similar to the adoption of Internet. Blockchain promotes distributed, open, inclusive, immutable, and secure architectural approaches, instead of centralized, hidden, exclusive, and alterable alternatives. The adoption of blockchain in the healthcare domain offers promising solutions for securing communications among stakeholders, efficient delivery of clinical reports, and integrating various kinds of private health records of individuals on a secure infrastructure. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to propose a holistic blockchain structure covering all stakeholders in the healthcare domain and to analyse opportunities and challenges by presenting an integrated blockchain architecture. The comprehensive view of blockchain based healthcare system consists of services as follows: personal medical health record storage and access, personal genomic data storage and access, inventory tracking and buy-sell mechanism, health research commons, health document notary services, doctor services, digital health wallet, peer-to peer insurance. The opportunities of using blockchain in the healthcare domain are considered with respect to several viewpoints such as transparency, accountability, decentralization, record accuracy, secure transactions, interoperability, lower costs, collaboration, agility, individualized care with specialized treatment, improved diagnosis methods, risk of insurance contract, prevention of counterfeit drugs and improved quality of medical research. Challenges associated with the implementation of blockchain in the healthcare domain are also highlighted, such as governance, lack of legacy, privacy, sustainability, scalability, adoption of participation, and cost of operations.

AB Open banking brings both the opportunities and challenges to banks all over the world. Due to the different economic development levels of each country and the gaps among financial environment maturity, all countries have different strategies and regulations towards the privacy protection of data in financial scenes, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by European Union (EU). A blockchain as a continuously growing list of records managed by a peer-to-peer network is widely used in various application scenarios, and can protect the privacy of financial data. However, financial blockchain still poses some problems that cannot fully meet the data protection needs. In order to address the existing problems, this paper proposes a new blockchain-based data privacy management framework. The framework consists of three components: a data privacy classification method according to the characteristics of financial data and a new collaborative filtering-based model and a confirmation data disclosure scheme for customer strategies based on the Nudge Theory. We implement a prototype and propose a set of algorithms for this management framework.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger system based on P2P network and originally used for a crypto currency system. The P2P network of Blockchain is maintained by full nodes which are in charge of verifying all the transactions in the network. However, most Blockchain user nodes do not act as full nodes, because workload of full nodes is quite high for personal mobile devices. Blockchain search queries, such as confirming balance, transaction contents, and transaction histories, from many users go to the full nodes. As a result, search throughput of full nodes would be a new bottleneck of Blockchain system, because the number of full nodes is less than the number of users of Blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose an acceleration method of Blockchain search using GPUs. More specifically, we introduce an array-based Patricia tree structure suitable for GPU processing so that we can make effective use of Blockchain feature that there are no update and delete queries. In the evaluations, the proposed method is compared with an existing GPU-based key-value search and a conventional CPU-based search in terms of the throughput of Blockchain key search. As a result, the throughput of our proposal is 3.4 times higher than that of the existing GPU-based search and 14.1 times higher than that of the CPU search when the number of keys is 80 x 2(20) and the key length is 256-bit in Blockchain search queries.

AB Blockchain has been evolving and gaining new heights over the years. The shift in the perspective is allowing new user cases beyond the cryptocurrency space. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets supported by the complexities of cryptography, game theory and peer-to-peer networks. Blockchain became a popular platform for decentralized applications, as well as a valuable tool for startups seeking fundraising. The aim of this research paper is to review and assess the status quo for each branch of use cases, and then analyze the enabling and inhibiting factors influencing the adoption of blockchain. These findings permit a broader comprehension over the concepts backing blockchain. It will help new users to establish strategies, develop solutions and encourage the employment of blockchain technology.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital decentralized cryptocurrency created by an individual under pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, it is the first digital decentralized currency. The importance of digital cryptocurrency and the concept of blockchain have been explored by several developers and organizations. It is assumed to be one of the secure and easy payment methods that can be used in the coming days. In this paper, we survey various topics under Bitcoin such as blocks, blockchains, mining process and proof of work(PoW).

AB The paper presents the concept of renewable energy management system. The idea behind the system is to exploit the potential of renewable energy generation sources so as to provide additional energy services and participation in a competitive energy market. These actions can significantly affect the shortening of the period of return on investment of individual customer in renewable energy sources. The paper contains a concept of Electricity Consumption and Supply Management System (ECSM) with application of blockchain technology. ECSM provides functionality to monitor and record continuously information about inbound and outbound energy to/from power grid. Except monitoring inbound and outbound energy, solution will provide the possibility to manage in automatic and manual way when energy should be sent to energy grid. Information about inbound/outbound energy will be part of smart contract which will be confirmed and stored in every node.

AB Blockchain inspires many people across the globe and has started getting many adoptions after realizing its promising benefits through successful trials. Applications of blockchain range from cryptocurrency, smart contract, banking, healthcare and identity management, insurance, land registry to IoT industry. However, scalability and throughput issues are major challenges of blockchain and are less researched. Many lightweight nodes especially IoT devices depend and put much workload on blockchain servers since they cannot store the full blockchain due to its huge size. This paper investigates performance bottlenecks in blockchain and presents efficient high performance system for caching the blockchain data in the FPGA network interface controller (NIC) for improving scalability and throughput of blockchain applications. We design a customized SHA-256 hash core specific for efficient blockchain caching to save hashing executions and improve the performance. We built and use Jansson and Curl libraries to interface our system with real Bitcoin core. We finally evaluate the throughput performance of the Bitcoin core. The overall result revealed that our system improves the throughput performance by 103 times when cache hit. The design also offers small work area utilization, low power consumption and higher performance.

AB In a bid to stamp out fraudulent crime, there is increased pressure on individuals to provide evidence that they possess a 'real' identity. Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.
   Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.
   In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to 'proof' that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data - or 'Digital identities' - pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a 'real' identity.
   This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual's digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a 'real' identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques. Where identity sources are considered reliable, a secure and intelligent digital identification artefact will be created. This artefact will emulate a blockchain-inspired ledger and may subsequently be used to prove identity in place of traditional paper documentation.

AB Today we are living in the 21st century where with the increase in technological advancements and IOT, human race is facing a large breakdown in security issues. With the fast-technological advancement, we face certain problems in our daily life. Vehicle security is one of the major issues in the current era.
   Car automation and surveillance is an escalating trend in this decade. The vehicle security has become a need of the time. In this paper we propose a real-time security system with a live 360-degree view of the vehicle and intelligence to the system made through using various sensors to pin point the area of contact to the vehicle which will be added advantage to the owner of the vehicle. We are using a security system which senses the motion, sends a notification to the owner, and the owners can also see the video through camera in their mobile phone app. The system works on the principle of real-time camera surveillance system. Moreover, the proposed system can also be extended to inculcate the concept of Ad-hoc networking in intelligent cars, to send a warning to the car at the back, in case of an accident which will press the brakes of car to stop at a safe distance. This paper lies in the field of Internet of things (IOT), Block chain, Smart cities, Data analytics, Mobile application, Knowledge management, Digital transformation, Networking, Wireless/Mobile Communication, Statistics in Society Signal Processing using smart cars using Raspberry pi, Sensors, Cameras, GPRS, GPS.

DE Block chain; Decentralization; Consensus mechanism; PoW; DPoS
AB The block chain has achieved great success in bit coin, and its decentralization idea caught highly attention of financial institutions, capital markets and academia. Decentralization is the most fundamental feature of the block chain, but decentralization sacrifices efficiency, while mining leads to high bit coin transaction costs; in some industries, such as the commercial retail, high efficiency and low cost are required. The consensus algorithm is the core technology to achieve non-centralization. This article proposes a DPoS consensus mechanism election algorithm. This algorithm improves the ring-based coordinator election algorithm. First, the algorithm is used to elect the agents, and then the final winner, reach a new consensus, meet the requirements of the block chain performance in the commercial retail sector, reduce transaction costs, and construct a fair, freely competitive, non-monopoly, secure and non-centralized block chain platform.

AB Blockchains are used to perform state agreement in a distributed system. However, there is no way to validate off-chain actions, such as physical actions, in the current architecture. This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture which features locally physically-verified transactions. From this new architecture, this paper presents a protocol for securing vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) without the need to constantly communicate with roadside units (RSUs) or other infrastructure components. However, issues such as privacy in VANETs and Blockchains are left to future work. This paper shows the results from simulations of the current system in order to note its weaknesses. In particular, this paper can be used as a benchmark to show that ideas such as Proof-of-Work and full blockchain validation cannot work in a purely peer-to-peer VANET.

   Game theory
AB Blockchain technology on the platform business becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility, and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers (SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients. The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform business are (i) how SPs' participation is reflected on its quality of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs.

AB Blockchain ushers in a new era for the global financial system with the advent of digital currency (cryptocurrency), and its impact can be felt in many related industries. Because of its possible applications, cryptocurrency draws significant attention from researchers. Although there are a number of risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to safety and privacy, just to name a few. In order to understand public opinion about cryptocurrency and to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the most important steps in the analysis is to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine education levels of investors or users who are interested in eight cryptocurrencies by using seven readability techniques on Reddit comments as a part of profiling. Results show that the education levels of users are approximately 60% in middle school, 30% in high school, and 10% in other levels according to the average of the seven readability technique results. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain profile information about the users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency.

AB Digital coin became an interesting subject for research in the last few years. For security reasons, the technical detail of digital coins (for example Bitcoin) are studied to stop security breaches. Bitcoin work dependently on a blockchain. Blockchain holds the record of all user's transactions. The user opens a wallet with public/private key pairs. The user then buy/sell his coin through the wallet. The security of the user's wallet depends on how secure the user's private key. Some people hide bitcoins (which in this case refers to the private key) in their house. Others hide the security key into a plain-text. In this paper we proposed a robust steganography technique to hide bitcoins into steganographic fractals. Steganographic fractal is our novel approach, it is not explored before. The fractal tree is selected for its simple recursive structure. The private-key bit stream is hidden by discretizing the angles and lengths of the tree branches. The tree can then be printed without the fear of being lost or stolen. The proposed approach showed high security and robustness to attacks.

AB In most crowdsensing systems, the quality of the collected data is varied and difficult to evaluate while the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in fraud and other problems. To solve these questions, a novel crowdsensing quality control model is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and twice consensuses are proposed to realize the non-repudiation and non-tampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, the quality grading evaluation (QGE) is put forward, in which the method of truth discovery and the idea of fuzzy theories are combined to evaluate the quality of sensing data, and the garbled circuit is used to ensure that evaluation criteria can not be leaked. Finally, the Experiments show that our model is feasible in time and effective in quality evaluation.

AB Over the last decade, the increasing uptake of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) at the grid edge transforms residential houses into complex energy "prosumers". A house with rooftop solar PV can both consume and export electricity. Hence, it can participate in a "Transactive Energy" network involving peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of excess electricity. The challenge is to keep track of these transactions and compensate buyers and sellers accordingly. Recently, blockchain has emerged as a distributed ledger technology which allows exchanges among participants without the need for a central market entity. There are several blockchain pilots in the energy sector, which focus on the business, legal and financial aspects, but without much details about how to implement a blockchain-based P2P trading platform. This paper addresses this issue by presenting laboratory-scale implementation of a blockchain network for exchange of solar electricity among participants using Hyperledger - an open-source collaborative effort. Participants, assets and transactions necessary to establish the blockchain-based network for keeping track of solar PV output exchanges are described, together with the smart contract, use cases and their implementation.

AB In 2008 Blockchain became known by Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the article "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." Blockchain technology facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the intermediary, which is safe and trust.
   Blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a distributed network of computers, continuously updated simultaneously and secure with encryption.
   Furthermore, blockchain uses cryptography to allow each participant on the network to manipulate the ledger in a secure way without the need for a centralized trusted party. Since the Bitcoin protocol is open source. This concept has led to the idea develop of smart contract.
   Blockchain technology can apply in non-Financial Uses which have application examples in many industries include energy sector. Energy Sector can apply this technology from grid management to retail & customer experience that will transformation to new business model.

AB Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger that promises tamper-proof secure transactions over the highly available and resilient network involving multiple participants. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has revolutionized the blockchain technology. Owing to its optimized validation mechanism, high scalability, efficient provenance, support for IoT and multiparty involvement, DAG is rapidly over-shadowing traditional blockchain architecture. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of most popular DAG based blockchain architectures including Nxt, IOTA, Orumesh, DagCoin, Byteball, Nano and XDAG. The comparison is based on the functional data structures for maintaining the ledger, consensus algorithms, transaction validation, ledger size, scalability and popularity. Extracting the best features various DAG based blockchains, we move on to outline the best of all worlds DAG-based blockchain architecture.

ID DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS
AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger that gained a prevalent attention in many areas. Many industries have started to implement blockchain solutions for their application and services. It is important to know the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of blockchain to understand its impact and applicability to various applications. The most well-known use case of blockchain is bitcoin: a cryptocurrency. Being a distributed ledger, consensus mechanism is needed among peer nodes of a blockchain network to ensure its proper working. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed in literature each having its own performance and security characteristics. One consensus algorithm cannot serve the requirements of every application. It is vital to technically compare the available consensus algorithms to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. We have identified and discussed parameters related to performance and security of consensus in blockchain. The consensus algorithms are analyzed and compared with respect to these parameters. Research gap regarding designing an efficient consensus algorithm and evaluating existing algorithms is presented. This paper will act as a guide for developers and researchers to evaluate and design a consensus algorithm.

ID ECONOMICS
AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency for managing and transferring money in a distributed manner. The Bitcoin network creates a complex system of economic incentives that governs its inner working, impacting the network's security guarantees and its evolution. Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business.

AB Widespread access to distributed energy requires new demands on the decentralization of power system transactions. Block chain technology, as a reliable underlying bookkeeping and information storage technology, can effectively break through the bottleneck of current energy transactions, broaden the application prospect of multi-energy complementary control technologies, realize the integration of panoramic information in the energy transaction process, and solve the current personal Security issues in energy trading. Firstly, this paper analyzes the demand of the block chain technology in the power system's energy trading and the current development status. It focuses on analyzing the applicability of the block chain in multi-energy systems. It also proposes the construction method and necessity of multi-energy system transactions based on heterogeneous block chain technology. Finally, the model of block chain technology in energy trading is given in detail, and compared with the traditional scheduling model to illustrate the superiority of block chain technology.

AB Within this paper, a novel primary level controller for intergrids is presented. The controller may be considered a decentralised master/slave-like control approach. It differs from conventional master/slave controllers in that slave units derive their reference values from a previously proposed secondary controller - a decentralised transactive energy market. The tertiary controller provides power references to the slave units upon execution of a market transaction whilst the voltage master supplies the network losses induced by these energy transactions. The commonly cited pit-fall of the master/slave approach is remedied with an additional controller which aims to hand-over voltage-control responsibility when necessary. The simulation results contained herein demonstrate good performance of the proposed controllers.

AB The fourth industrial revolution is a recent hot issue in Korea. The purpose of this paper is to search the internet news related to the fourth industrial revolution and conduct topic analysis in order to find the idea and direction of the fourth industrial revolution in business, government, and industry. To this end, this study first collected internet news related the fourth industrial revolution in 2018. Second, the collected data were preprocessed to remove stop-words. Third, LDA analysis was performed with the refined data. As a result of LDA analysis, the keywords related to the fourth industrial revolution were classified into four categories. We found the main topics as Policy, New Technology, Industry and Finance. Fourth, word2vec analysis and centrality analysis were performed in order to analyze topics in detail. By analyzing centrality, it was able to derive to hidden topics which were not derived by LDA analysis. In addition, the intensity of the topic could be obtained through centrality analysis. As a result of centrality analysis, AI, Block Chain, Nation, Robot and Virtual Currency were elicited as new main topics. This study reveals concepts and directions of the fourth industrial revolution and can help guide relevant future policy for the fourth industrial revolution.

AB The U.S. power grid is a complex system of systems that requires a trustworthy, reliable, and secure global supply chain. A formidable challenge considering the increasing number of networked industrial control systems (ICS) and energy delivery systems (EDS) and growing number of intermediary distributors, vendors and integrators involved. Grid modernization has increased the use of "smart" energy devices that automate, digitize, network, and bring together the cyber-physical energy supply chain. In the current Energy Internet of Things (EIoT) environment, the growth of data speed and size requirements as well as the number of critical cyber assets has generated new North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) compliance requirements and cyber supply chain security challenges for vendors, regulators, and utilities. The issuance of Order No. 829 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) instructed the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to confront cybersecurity supply chain risk management for ICS software and hardware, as well as the networking and computing services associated with Bulk Electric System (BES) operations. To meet these goals, current technology and processes must be improved to better identify, monitor, and audit vulnerable EIoT environments. This paper examines how blockchain technology can enable NERC CIP compliance as well as aid in the security of the BES supply chain through an immutable cryptographically signed distributed ledger that allows for improved data security, provenance and auditability.

AB We describe an agent-based conceptual model of a Blockchain system. Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging of digital transactions in an add-only ledger record. We model and simulate an expanding Blockchain network, describing the participating agents, the transactions, and the verified add-only public ledger record achieving decentralized consensus. All of the essential details of the functioning of the Blockchain including the behaviors and decisions made by agents deciding to join as well as participate in the market are detailed in the prototype model. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the essential elements and functioning of a Blockchain system, implement a generalized simulation and a measure of Blockchain efficiency from an agent choice and energy cost perspective. Our preliminary results indicate that mining choice (transaction block to verify) coupled with proof of work incentives are critical for energy efficiency.

AB Blockchain technology is often referred to as a groundbreaking innovation and the harbinger of a new economic era. Blockchains may be capable of engendering a new type of economic system: the blockchain economy. In the blockchain economy, agreed-upon transactions would be enforced autonomously, following rules defined by smart contracts. The blockchain economy would manifest itself in a new form of organizational design-decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)-which are organizations with governance rules specified in the blockchain. We discuss the blockchain economy along dimensions defined in the IT governance literature: decision rights, accountability, and incentives. Our case study of a DAO illustrates that governance in the blockchain economy may depart radically from established notions of governance. Using the three governance dimensions, we propose a novel IT governance framework and a research agenda for governance in the blockchain economy. We challenge common assumptions in the blockchain discourse, and propose promising information systems research related to these assumptions.

AB The paper presents an in detailed case study of integrating BlockChain (BC) in IoT ecosystems in order to achieve security and privacy. Since the use in cryptocurrency, BlockChain has gained tremendous attraction due to the versatile application prospects it raises. As internet of things (IoT) is emerging towards the smart city requirements, device or data security seems to be a major concern. Therefore, BlockChain based decentralized and distributed system can meet the privacy preserving management in IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we discuss the necessity of utilizing BlockChain for IoT security, privacy, management. We present a literature overview of current progresses and security enhancement in sensor networks using BlockChain; their scope, prospects and limitations as well. Finally, we suggest some future directions to indicate further areas of improvement.

DE Ripple credit network; IOweYou (IOU); credit devilry; rippling; faulty
   gateways; stale exchange offers
AB The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond.
   This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.

ID SMART CONTRACTS
AB Blockchain technology becomes increasingly popular. It also attracts scams, for example, Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.

DE BlockChain; Voting Mechanism; Network Security; Bilinear Pairing
AB As technology advances, many countries have now opted for electronic voting systems. Any voting system must follow principles of transparency and impartiality in order to achieve fairness; the electronic voting process must also be protected against cyberattacks or denial-of-service attacks (DDOS) because such attacks may affect the processing time in voting procedures and even hinder the fairness in voting. This study establishes a network security mechanism for voting systems based on blockchain technology. The blockchain mechanism employs a distributed architecture that can prevent system shutdown resulting from malicious cyberattacks; additionally, any user in the blockchain can authenticate data integrity, which satisfies requirements of transparency and impartiality in voting systems. This study utilizes bilinear pairing to establish network security in voting systems, which call for anonymity, authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. When authenticating voting integrity, the user's anonymity must be ensured to prevent identity revelation, and the data must be protected against malicious tampering such security measures also fulfill blockchain requirements. The proposed voting system relies on the basis of blockchains to create a trustworthy voting system. In current blockchain technology, smart contracts allow the establishment of voter-related regulations to prevent controversies during voting processes. Additionally, in order to establish both a secret ballot and an open ballot system, the study also implements a bilinear pairing security mechanism to ensure the overall security of a voting procedure.

AB There has been increased interest in the use of blockchains to control Internet of Things devices either directly, or through smart contracts. Many blockchains, such as Ethereum and Fabric, have support for smart contracts. The use of public blockchains while attractive due to their decentralization and availability, do pose challenges, such as unpredictable transaction latencies and cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Transactions in the Ethereum network, such as invokations of smart contracts used to control an IoT device, have no fairness or eventuality guarantees. In this work we describe a "spam attack" method available to parties with sufficient cryptocurrency reserves to delay a statistically significant portion of transactions submitted to the Ethereum network. This paper derives estimations on the costs and effects of such an attack, and is based on an analysis of historical transactions.

DE blockchain; agent-based simulation; smart contract
AB The growing interest for decentralized production of renewable energies calls for new market approaches. In this context, the blockchain is considered as a key technology for enabling decentralized local energy markets. Following this idea, several market solutions were proposed by the academic community. However, their technical feasibility or economical viability are yet to be assessed due to the lack of simulation frameworks. In this paper, we propose an agent-based simulation framework to experiment blockchain-backed energy market places. Moreover, based on realistic data of households located in northern France, we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameters on economics and blockchain system performances. Finally, we have implemented our solution on Raspberry Pies IoT devices to measure the actual power consumption of such systems.

AB Purchase management of medical supplies is a critical and important process that affects the services provision quality. Nonetheless, it is facing a growing pressure to provide visibility and traceability of the purchase, to reduce fraud, to improve flexibility and to ensure communication between everyone involved. Currently, private health institutions in Peru choose to implant different software products within the same company with restricted visibility access to other concerned parties and based on information from a single source. A new alternative is Blockchain technology, since it provides a single source of shared truth to all participants and ensures that the information cannot be altered, thus offering high levels of transparency that, together with IoT technology, creates not only visibility about where things are, but also traceability, showing the current state of things.

AB Information asymmetry exists amongst stakeholders in the current food supply chain. Lack of standardization in data format, lack of regulations, and siloed, legacy information systems exasperate the problem. Global agriculture trade is increasing creating a greater need for traceability in the global supply chain. This paper introduces Harvest Network, a theoretical end-to-end, vis a vie "farm-to-fork", food traceability application integrating the Ethereum blockchain and IoT devices exchanging GS1 message standards. The goal is to create a distributed ledger accessible for all stakeholders in the supply chain. Our design effort creates a basic framework ( artefact) for building a prototype or simulation using existing technologies and protocols [1]. The next step is for industry practitioners and researchers to apply AGILE methods for creating working prototypes and advanced projects that bring about greater transparency.

AB Blockchain is the notorious technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. A large industrial chain ecology is growing around innovations of blockchain. However, given that it is being developed exponentially the challenges businesses are facing finally have a solution - blockchain. Blockchain is undeniably revolutionary in a sense that it brings convenience to customers and companies. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, trustworthiness and collective maintenance, it provides a trustworthy platform in order to achieve a reliable peer-to-peer delivery of value without relying on a single centralized organization. With this in mind, blockchain is foundation businesses need to establish new relationships. The objective of this paper is to explore how blockchain plays a role in different business applications by illustrating what blockchain is as well as exactly how it can be applied to businesses in the current day.

AB The Blockchain technology is currently considered as a major paradigm shift in software architectures and applications. Indeed, it enables the automation of business worflows, using smart contracts, and hence the collaboration between trustless entities, without having to rely on any centralized or third parties. In this context, the automated generation of smart contracts, from high level business process models, has recently received increased interests within the research community. In this paper, we introduce the Blockchain Studio framework, which is a fork of Caterpillar, and whose objective is to enable the generation and automation of role-based business workflows on Ethereum based blockchains. The architecture and implementation of Blockchain Studio are firstly discussed, followed by the analysis of the achieved benefits on a practical use case related to the management of vehicles' life-cycles and data history. Various research challenges and opportunities are then highlighted.

DE blockchain; enterprise networks; Hyperledger Composer
AB Mass application of blockchain technology is becoming reality. Adopting blockchain to enterprise network is innovative approach. It brings novel solution for increasing network security and improved efficiency of network maintenance. Key feature of blockchain is storing data securely in encrypted chains of blocks. It is a distributed database processing continuously growing list of transactions. This feature makes blockchain extremely resistant to unauthorized modifications of stored data. Application of blockchain for network monitoring and management facilitates secure and distributed medium for configuration of network nodes. Furthermore, all modifications in configuration of devices are traceable in blockchain and configuration recovery after incident is rather simple and transparent.
   In this paper we introduce architecture for monitoring and managing enterprise networks through private blockchain. Using blockchain, any change is attributable to administrator as in traditional network management with AAA implemented, but in addition rollback to previous configuration is simple. Using blockchain instead of traditional network management approaches built on database, distributed nature of blockchain removes single point of failure and simplify management of distributed networks.
   Our solution utilizes blockchain for secure dissemination of configuration changes to network nodes. Proof of concept of our solution was validated with Hyperledger Composer in our Cisco Lab.

AB This paper proposes a solution to facilitate on-orbit satellite communication data integrity and security by utilizing blockchain technology. A proliferating demand has created a growing reliance on satellites for communications, GPS, imagery, and other uses. The decreased cost of entry into the space industry has increased the number of entrants and also the number of satellites and the amount of space debris. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to spacecraft. Therefore, tracking these objects is crucial. Blockchain technology offers a unique solution to this problem by utilizing functions, processes, and information already incorporated into satellites while maintaining a maximum of forty-eight hours of data. The use of blockchain provides a high level of trusted positional data that can be used to predict and avoid collisions which will save billions of dollars and valuable time. This paper provides a technological design, rational, and risk analysis of this proposal.

AB This paper introduces a small Java application named ChainTutor for learning basic Blockchain concepts. Although the term Blockchain is widely known and Blockchain technologies are finding applications in various areas such as banking, healthcare and Internet of Things, some concepts of Blockchain are not easy for beginners to understand. Fully text-based tutorials are often difficult to follow. General picture of Blockchain operations gets lost in lengthy textual descriptions. With the Java application introduced in this paper, users can experiment with key Blockchain concepts through a graphical user interface. They can generate keys, hashes, transactions, blocks and wallets. They can see the low level details of a blockchain such as encryption keys and hashes. They can see how mining works and how blocks are added to a blockchain. Parameters of a blockchain can also be varied in order to observe their impact on performance or even to make a blockchain invalid. The Java application is intended to be used in classroom environment by instructors when they teach introductory Blockchain courses.

AB Nowadays, a lot of Internet-of-Things devices and its applications are developed to improve the people's quality of life. With the growth of circulating IoT devices in human's community, improper device management and firmware distribution mechanism could lead to many issues that harm the security and privacy of the device owner. In this paper, a firmware update framework for IoT devices based on blockchain technology is proposed. The proposed framework aims to provide secure verification on the firmware released by the device manufacturer. In addition, the integrity of distributed firmware to the end-device could be maintained. The proposed firmware update framework consists of four processes: the creation of firmware update contract, the creation of firmware replication contract, the direct firmware update mechanism and the indirect firmware update mechanism.

AB IoT networks are designed to connect as many devices as possible. Since any device can be connected to an IoT network, it faces an authentication issue, which may be exploited by attackers to break into the IoT network. A solution discussed in this paper is to make use of blockchain technology to authenticate IoT devices before it joins an IoT network. Based on the characteristics of blockchain, it can be used to create the digital identification of IoT devices and authenticate them. Authenticated Devices Configuration Protocol (ADCP) is proposed to achieve this authentication process. All results of the solution have been demonstrated by a fully working implementation, and do not solely rely on theoretical considerations or simulations.

ID COMMITMENT
AB We introduce BitML, a domain-specific language for specifying contracts that regulate transfers of bitcoins among participants, without relying on trusted intermediaries. We define a symbolic and a computational model for reasoning about BitML security. In the symbolic model, participants act according to the semantics of BitML, while in the computational model they exchange bitstrings, and read/append transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. A compiler is provided to translate contracts into standard Bitcoin transactions. Participants can execute a contract by appending these transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, according to their strategies. We prove the correctness of our compiler, showing that computational attacks on compiled contracts are also observable in the symbolic model.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a notable exception, Carlsten et al. [17] postulated that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap would form - miners would avoid mining when the available fees are insufficient.
   In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system as a game we call the gap game. We analyze the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide range of scenarios.
   Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner coalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required conditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future cryptocurrency design.

AB The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol.
   To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous.
   The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains:
   Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider;
   We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols;
   We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction "confirmed";
   We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system;
   We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore "balancing"-attack.
   In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages.
   We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes.

AB We present a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol, Ouroboros Genesis, that enables parties to safely join (or rejoin) the protocol execution using only the genesis block information. Prior to our work, PoS protocols either required parties to obtain a trusted "checkpoint" block upon joining and, furthermore, to be frequently online or required an accurate estimate of the number of online parties to be hardcoded into the protocol logic. This ability of new parties to "bootstrap from genesis" was a hallmark property of the Bitcoin blockchain and was considered an important advantage of PoW-based blockchains over PoS-based blockchains since it facilitates robust operation in a setting with dynamic availability, i.e., the natural setting-without external trusted objects such as checkpoint blocks-where parties come and go arbitrarily, may join at any moment, or remain offline for prolonged periods of time. We prove the security of Ouroboros Genesis against a fully adaptive adversary controlling less than half of the total stake in a partially synchronous network with unknown message delay and unknown, varying levels of party availability. Our security proof is in the Universally Composable setting assuming the most natural abstraction of a hash function, known as the strict Global Random Oracle (ACM-CCS 2014); this highlights an important advantage of PoS blockchains over their PoW counterparts in terms of composability with respect to the hash function formalisation: rather than a strict GRO, PoW-based protocol security requires a "local" random oracle. Finally, proving the security of our construction against an adaptive adversary requires a novel martingale technique that may be of independent interest in the analysis of blockchain protocols.

ID INFORMATION; AGREEMENT
AB A major approach to overcoming the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use sharding which is to split the overheads of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. These groups work in parallel to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation, and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability, these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems.
   We propose RapidChain, the first sharding-based public blockchain protocol that is resilient to Byzantine faults from up to a 1/3 fraction of its participants, and achieves complete sharding of the communication, computation, and storage overhead of processing transactions without assuming any trusted setup. RapidChain employs an optimal intra-committee consensus algorithm that can achieve very high throughputs via block pipelining, a novel gossiping protocol for large blocks, and a provably-secure reconfiguration mechanism to ensure robustness. Using an efficient cross-shard transaction verification technique, our protocol avoids gossiping transactions to the entire network. Our empirical evaluations suggest that RapidChain can process (and confirm) more than 7,300 tx/sec with an expected confirmation latency of roughly 8.7 seconds in a network of 4,000 nodes with an overwhelming time-to-failure of more than 4,500 years.

ID UNIVERSALLY COMPOSABLE SECURITY
AB One of the fundamental challenges that hinder further adaption of decentralized cryptocurrencies is scalability. Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger -the so-called blockchain -transaction throughput is inherently limited. An important proposal to significantly improve scalability are off-chain protocols, where the massive amount of transactions is executed without requiring the costly interaction with the blockchain. Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbitrary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and prove the security of our construction against powerful adversaries. An additional benefit of our construction is the use of channel virtualization, which further reduces latency and costs in complex channel networks.

ID SECURITY
AB We introduce FairSwap -an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to our new protocols, we provide formal security definitions for smart contract based fair exchange, and prove security of our construction. Finally, we illustrate several applications of our basic protocol and evaluate practicality of our approach via a prototype implementation for fairly selling large files over the cryptocurrency Ethereum.

AB We present BEAT, a set of practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols for completely asynchronous environments. BEAT is flexible, versatile, and extensible, consisting of five asynchronous BFT protocols that are designed to meet different goals (e.g., different performance metrics, different application scenarios). Due to modularity in its design, features of these protocols can be mixed to achieve even more meaningful trade-offs between functionality and performance for various applications. Through a 92-instance, five-continent deployment of BEAT on Amazon EC2, we show that BEAT is efficient: roughly, all our BEAT instances significantly outperform, in terms of both latency and throughput, HoneyBadgerBFT, the most efficient asynchronous BFT known.

AB Since it first appears in 2008 as the underlying technology of the Bitcoin payment system, Blockchain has gained further interests, since it offers a distributed peer-to-peer ledger where non-trusting members can interact with each other, in addition, members can now run applications without the need for a central authority with the same level of certainty. however blockchain suffers from certain limitations and challenges, specifically, when combined with Internet of things (iot) infrastructure, namely the high cost needed in the mining process due to restricted computation resources of iot devices, in this paper we will focus on a survey on three of most relevant papers that discuss resources management in mobile blockchain then we we will propose a matching model based on graph theory for optimal resources allocation between services offered by an Edge service provider and demands from miners of a blockchain network.

DE Blockchain([3]); Artificial Intelligence([4]); critical data;
   pre-trained model
AB The age of deep learning is picking up in a way that increases the curiosity in man to make the world of predictions as realistic as possible. In pursuit of achieving this goal, he comes up with approximate algorithms([8]), that predict satisfactorily with long training despite the use of GPUs. A deep learning model is not perfect, unless it accommodates new trends and the data of latest discovery that would impact significantly in future inferences. Assimilating this critical data into the pre-trained deep learning model([6]) involves validity of the data. A Blockchain-like structure could be incorporated atop the data, validate and introduce the authentic data to the under-performing pre-trained model. We call this a blended learning which uses blockchainified data to fine tune the model. This idea of secure data assistance to update pre-trained model opens up a novel field of research that brings a synergy between Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Blockchain.

   Encryption System; Privacy Preserving
AB The synergy between artificial intelligence and blockchain is increasing in the computing environment. To realize this blockchain technology making its way into applications such as healthcare, financial services, Internet of Things and much more., that use artificial intelligence making it more defendable to attacks. The current blockchain technology uses different encryption algorithms such as SHA256, MD5 etc. The blockchain attacks such as collision attack, primage attack and attacks on wallet motivated us to experiment on partial homomorphic encryption to enhance the strength of blockchain technology. This article considers i) Goldwasser-Micali and ii) Paillier encryption schemes for the comparative evaluation study with a focus on data privacy techniques. We believed and proved that the above two encryption schemes that were considered have less processing time and provide more strength to the possible attacks. While we present our preliminary results in this study, we discuss the pros and cons of the Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier and non-homomorphic encryption schemes that are expected to add value to blockchain technology to be used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.

AB Intelligent Cyber-physical systems can be modeled as multi-agent systems with planning capability to impart adaptivity for changing contexts. In such multi-agent systems, the protocol for plan execution must result in the proper completion and ordering of actions in spite of their distributed execution. However, in untrusted scenarios, there is a possibility of agents not respecting the protocol either due to faults or due to malicious reasons thereby resulting in plan failure. In order to prevent such situations, we propose to implement the execution of agents through smart contracts. This points to a generic architecture seamlessly integrating intelligent planning-based CPS and smart-contracts.

DE Blockchain; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Machine Learning (ML);
   Marketplace; Incentivization
AB Today, Machine learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way through which data is perceived. Enterprises are using ML models to gain insights from the data and build applications of highest quality and accuracy. In this process, they are trying to seek more data to derive robust conclusions. However, relevant data are privately held and resides with an organization's premise which thwarts the development of accurate models. Decentralized AI has become an attractive technological trend for enterprises as it ensures model improvement and creates a demand for them through a marketplace. Nonetheless, its potential can be unleashed if there is a massive user participation enabled through fair rewards to its contributors.
   Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we present DInEMMo, a solution that is built on the convergence of decentralized AI and Blockchain. DInEMMo is enabled with configurable smart contracts with the following features: (1) represent the ML model and use case attributes, (2) generation of models (new/enhanced) based on user input, (3) compute the price of the ML model based on the user policy, and (4) calculate the incentives to the model's owner and co-contributors. Using these features, we qualitatively evaluate the relevancy of the system for the use case on Medical Diagnostics and show the significance of domain specific properties in rewarding the contributors and further, determining the model price.

AB Although cloud-based malware defense services have made significant contributions to thwarting malware attacks, there have been privacy concern over using these services to analyze suspicious files which may contain user-sensitive data. We develop a new platform called BigBing (a big data approach to binary code genomics) to offer a privacy preserving cloud-based malware classification service. BigBing relies on a community of contributors who would like to share their binary executables, and uses a novel blockchain-based scheme to ensure the privacy of possibly user-sensitive data contained within these files. To scale up malware defense services, BigBing trains user-specific classification models to detect malware attacks seen in their environments. We have implemented a prototype of BigBing, comprised of a big data cluster, a pool of servers for feature extraction, and a frontend gateway that facilitates the interaction between users and the BigBing backend. Using a real-world malware dataset, we evaluate both execution and classification performances of the service offered by BigBing. Our experimental results demonstrate that BigBing offers a useful privacy preserving cloud-based malware classification service to fight against the ever-growing malware attacks.

AB Innovation in cashless payment instruments can lead to complications in the use of quantity targets in monetary control. The empirical study found that the presence of non-cash payment instruments using cards can replace the role of cash payment instruments in economist transactions in Indonesia. The growth of electronic money when viewed on a monthly basis is much faster than the growth of debit and credit card cards, a monthly increase of electronic money can reach 70%-100%, while debit and credit card cards only grow in the range of 20%. This study aims to analyze the design of e-money, as well as provide some development ideas that must be done related to the implementation of e-money.

AB Perceived price volatility of cryptocurrencies may distract practitioners from further developments in the blockchain space that may generate audit and other implications. As next step applications and developments are built on top of existing blockchain programming, the potential implications for both accounting and legal practitioners may be substantive. Especially as different blockchain tools and platforms become more robust and conducive for business and transactional use, the importance of being able to attest and report on this information will move closer toward the mainstream. This article discusses the rise of blockchain applications in a manner applicable for both practitioners and academics, as well as the implications these applications will have on attestation and compliance reporting.

AB Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.

AB We design and implement TwinsCoin, the first cryptocurrency based on a provably secure and scalable public blockchain design using both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms. Different from the proof-of-work based Bitcoin, our construction uses two types of resources, computing power and coins (i.e., stake). The blockchain in our system is more robust than that in a pure proof-of-work based system; even if the adversary controls the majority of mining power, we can still have the chance to secure the system by relying on honest stake. In contrast, Bitcoin blockchain will be insecure if the adversary controls more than 50% of mining power.
   Our design follows a recent provably secure proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid blockchain [11]. In order to make our construction practical, we considerably enhance its design. In particular, we introduce a new strategy for difficulty adjustment in the hybrid blockchain and provide a theoretical analysis of it. We also show how to construct a light client for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and evaluate the proposal practically.
   We implement our newdesign. Our implementation uses a recent modular development framework for blockchains, called Scorex. It allows us to change only certain parts of an application leaving other codebase intact. In addition to the blockchain implementation, a testnet is deployed. Source code is publicly available.

DE Bitcoin; Mixing service; Helix; Blockchain analysis
AB Bitcoin mixing services improve anonymity by breaking the connection between Bitcoin addresses. In the darkweb environment, many illegal trades, such as in drugs or child pornography, avoid their transactions being traced by exploiting mixing services. Therefore, de-mixing algorithms are needed to identify illegal financial flows and to reduce criminal activity. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, few studies on analyzing mixing services and de-anonymizing transactions have been proposed.
   In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of real-world mixing services, and propose a de-mixing algorithm for Helix, one of the most widely used Bitcoin mixing services. The proposed algorithm de-anonymizes the relationship between the input and output addresses of mixing services by exploiting the static and dynamic parameters of mixing services. Our experiment showed that, we could identify the relationships between the input and output addresses of the Helix mixing service with a 99.14% accuracy rate.

AB Blockchain-based replicated ledgers, pioneered in Bitcoin, are effective against double spending, but inherently attract centralised mining pools and incompressible transaction delays.
   We propose a framework that forgoes blockchains, building a decentralised ledger as a self-scaling graph of cross-verifying transactions. New transactions validate prior ones, forming a thin graph secured by a cumulative proof-of-work mechanism giving fair and predictable rewards for each participant.
   We exhibit rapid confirmation of new transactions, even across a large network affected by latency. We also show, both theoretically and experimentally, a strong convergence property: that any valid transaction entering the system quickly become enshrined in the ancestry of all future transactions.

AB In the past years, the security of Bitcoin-like protocols has been intensively studied. However, previous investigations are mainly focused on the single-mode version of Bitcoin protocol, where the protocol is running among full nodes (miners). In this paper, we initiate the study of multi-mode cryptocurrency protocols. We generalize the recent framework by Garay et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) with new security definitions that capture the security of realistic cryptocurrency systems (e.g. Bitcoin with full and lightweight nodes). We provide the first rigorous security model for addressing the "blockchain bloat" issue. As an immediate application of our new framework, we analyze the security of existing blockchain pruning proposals for Bitcoin aiming to improve the storage efficiency of network nodes by pruning unnecessary information from the ledger.

AB The blockchain is an emerging technology. Because of its efficiency and functionality, it is widely considered to have revolutionary application prospects. As a supporting part of the data structure, the hash function is important for ensuring the availability and security of the blockchain. To evaluate the security of blockchain technology it is important to analyze several security criteria of the hash functions used in the blockchain. This paper focuses on two security criteria-hiding and puzzle-friendliness-that the hash function should satisfy in the blockchain proposed by Narayanan et al. (Narayanan A, Bonneau J, Felten E, et al. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2016). Under the framework of Rogaway-Shrimpton's theory, their definitions are mathematically described and their relation is proved. Also, comparisons between the two criteria and traditional ones in hash functions are made. The conclusions of this paper point out that for hash functions, it is harder to break hiding and puzzle-friendliness than to break preimage resistance, which shows that hash functions proven to be preimage-resistant or tested by preimage cryptanalysis like SHA256 tend to be enough to be used in the corresponding parts of the blockchain design. At the same time, from the attackers' view the conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for studying the potential attacks on and defects that may exist in the structure of the hash functions applied in the blockchain.

DE blockchain; smart contracts; termination; non-termination
AB Termination of smart contracts is crucial for any blockchain system's security and consistency, especially for those supporting Turing-complete smart contract languages. Resource-constrained blockchain systems, like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, could prevent smart contracts from terminating properly when the pre-allocated resources are not sufficient. The Zen system utilizes the dependent type system of the programming language F* to prove the termination of smart contracts for all inputs during compilation time. Since the smart contract execution usually depends on the current blockchain state and user inputs, this approach is not always successful. In this work, we propose a lazy approach by statically proving conditional termination and non-termination of a smart contract to determine input conditions under which the contract terminates or not. Prior to the execution of the smart contract, the proof-carrying blockchain system will check that its current state and the contract's input satisfy the termination conditions in order to determine if the contract is qualified (i.e., eventually terminating) to run on the chain.

AB Most cryptocurrency systems mint new coins according to a pre-determined rate, which contributes to inflation instead of solely by the actual demand. On the other hand, the blockchain, or whatever distributed consensus protocol underlying the cryptocurrency, can only process a limited number of transactions in a given time interval. To address both of these two issues, we propose a methodology that connects the coin minting with the prosperity of a cryptocurrency. Specifically, when there are fewer transactions, any cryptocurrency adopting our methodology will introduce a greater inflation to motivate transactions. Moreover, this methodology provides deflations and turns the currency towards a reserve of value when the network burden is too heavy.

AB Purpose: The article considers one of the possible approaches to building a fundamentally new business model for dental industry with a concept of a self-organizing industry management system based on blockchain platform, crypto currency and reward for consumer target behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical design based on literature review, the content analysis and practical experience of business model transformation in digital platform economy and innovative blockchain technology, while the authors develop, describe and implement a new concept of a new business model in dentistry. The factual basis was the materials of an experiment conducted in the Netherlands to create a platform community Dentacoin based on blockchain platform.
   Findings: The developed concept of the business model in dentistry shows the main mechanisms that make the model attractive to the consumer services: obtaining objective information about services and producers; formation of a contract on the basis of independent diagnostics and its insurance; financial and logistical support of the service.
   Research/practical implications: The results of theoretical and practical research confirmed the possibility and expediency of the business model innovation of dental industry. The analysis of the current stage of Dentacoin Project implementation shows that business model works.
   Originality/value: The proposed concept of business model based on blockchain technology is fundamentally new for the dental industry. It is the first time describe and systemize a new management mechanism of value creation together with utilizing the blockchain advantages. The creation and implementation of the first blockchain-based platform in dentistry allows achieving transformative change of a whole industry and will greatly enrich both the theory and practice of transformational phenomena.

AB Development of secure methods for storing log files is of tremendous importance for cyber security. One of the first actions by a hacker upon penetrating a machine is editing the log files to remove evidence of their presence. We propose to improve the security of these log files through a blockchain based solution. We show how our solution can be used to help organizations to mutually protect their sensitive log data even if some of them are compromised. Our solution allows data confidentiality between the collaborative parties.

AB Enormous research efforts have been investigated in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking to improve users safety, traffic condition, and provide different reliable services, that are challenging tasks to accomplish in the current Internet model. In-network caching is one of the promising features of Named Data Networking, a new future Internet architecture based on content name instead of the host address. It aims to enhance the network performance, data availability, distribution, and access. The applicability of NDN in VANET introduced several issues, especially in the security and trust relationships. In this paper, we present a reputation-based blockchain mechanism to secure the cache in the vehicular environment and enhance the trust between cache stores and consumer vehicles. The obtained results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the normal NDN behavior by providing only trust content in the network.

ID MANAGEMENT; SCHEME; SETS
AB In this paper, we propose a new framework based on two main concepts: Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN) and Blockchain to efficiently manage and secure Vehicular Social Network (VSN). Using SDVN makes the network programmable, virtualized, and partitionable, but also it creates a well-known vulnerability named single-point of failure. Hence we propose to introduce a Blockchain paradigm that enables to certify the transactions and provide anonymity of data in distributed way using miners nodes. To this end, we introduce three levels of controllers: Principal controller (PC), Road Side Units (RSU) and miners. The PC has a global overview of the network like network topology. The RSU is an intermediate between the PC and the miners. We select local controllers acting as miners due to safety and performance. In order to select miners, we propose a Distributed Miners Connected Dominating Set algorithm (DM-CDS). The DM-CDS is a distributed algorithm with a single phase that supports dynamic topology. The selection of miners is based on a function called miner-score which depends on trust parameter particularly trust metric and network parameters such as: the connectivity degree, the average link quality indicator and the rank. The performance of the proposed DM-CDS is evaluated using many scenarios with different parameters like trust metric, node density, node mobility and radio range. The obtained results show the importance of the proposed architecture in terms of number of miners (CDS size) and robustness with different scenarios.

DE Peace engineering; Blockchain; Higher Education
AB Peace engineering implies taking positive and proactive actions to promote peace and justice. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a distributed sequence of blocks which acts like a public ledger. Motivations to develop blockchain based systems are usually related to transparency and trust. Inherently, blockchain ideals relate to peace engineering because of the way users can manage information globally: transparently and confidently. Application of blockchain in higher education may represent a fundamental change in the way professors deliver contents, manage courses, and even assess student work. Moreover, higher education institutions can find blockchain useful as it has the potential to change the way of providing certifications and the way knowledge is managed, produced, and shared. In this work, we review previous works that address blockchain implementation in higher education highlighting implementation advantages and possible disadvantages. Additionally, we explore further potential applications of smart contracts as a tool in blockchain based approaches to enhance engineering education programs.

AB Peacekeeping and humanitarian aid interventions in Somalia have attempted to bring peace and stability' to the country and region for more than twenty-five years. Different dynamics characterize four distinct phases of these interventions, determining the likelihood of conflict transformation. These dynamics display archetypal system behaviors representative of other persistent conflicts in Africa during the same time period. Field interviews combined with comparative statistics informed system models of conflict dynamics in Africa and Somalia. The models explored the relative impact of intervention feedback loops and key levers on potential for conflict transformation. It is shown that sustainable peace depends less on the appropriate sequencing of aid than on transparency, trust, and cooperation between various intervention actors and stakeholders to enable accountability at the local level. Technical innovations are needed to build transparency and trust between intervention stakeholders without increasing security risks. A potential solution is proposed that incorporates predictive analytics into peer -to -peer networks for monitoring interventions.

TI Hyperledger Fabric: A Distributed Operating System for Permissioned
   Blockchains

DT Proceedings Paper

CL Porto, PORTUGAL
AB Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).
   Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.
   This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The emergence of a "post-fact" world has seen knowledge being misinterpreted and manipulated to suit diverse purposes. Information from credible sources is often drowned out by 'facts' with dubious provenance. It is not enough to simply establish knowledge provenance if this meta-data can be changed afterwards. This paper presents a possible solution using blockchains to manage knowledge provenance. The solution is modelled using a concrete example of knowledge institutions. Variations and extensions to suit other domains are suggested. Particularly, a graph based variation of the blockchain is outlined. We also discuss the impact of our model beyond technology.

AB This paper enlightens the stipulation of blockchain beyond the bitcoin and identifies the key challenges in the implementation of blockchain on a small scale or newly implemented projects based on the literature review, furthermore it also introduces Block maturity level (BML) as a Consensus protocol, which eliminates the 51% attack, the hardfork problem and small-scale problem by introducing sub-blocks as a defense mechanism against attackers. This technique can be used in the implementation of blockchain where the hash power and difficulty is lower and easy to match-up. This proposed consensus protocol would immensely secure the implementation of the blockchain on different projects.

DE Blockchain; Interacting processes; DMN
AB Recently blockchain technology has been introduced to execute interacting business processes in a secure and transparent way. While the foundations for process enactment on blockchain have been researched, the execution of decisions on blockchain has not been addressed yet. In this paper we argue that decisions are an essential aspect of interacting business processes, and, therefore, also need to be executed on blockchain. The immutable representation of decision logic can be used by the interacting processes, so that decision taking will be more secure, more transparent, and better auditable. The approach is based on a mapping of the DMN language S-FEEL to Solidity code to be run on the Ethereum blockchain. The work is evaluated by a proof-of-concept prototype and an empirical cost evaluation.

DE Accounting ontology; Smart contracts; UFO
AB DLT suggests a new way to implement the Accounting Information System, but after reviewing the current literature our conclusion is that an ontologically sound consensus-based design is missing to date. Against this research gap, the paper introduces a DLT-based shared ledger solution in a formal way and compliant with Financial Reporting Standards. We build on the COFRIS accounting ontology (grounded in UFO-S) and the blockchain ontology developed by De Kruijff & Weigand that distinguishes between a Data-logical level, an Infological and an Essential (conceptual) level. It is shown how consensual and agent-specific parts of the business exchange transaction can be represented in a concise way, and how this pattern can be implemented using Smart Contracts.

AB To prevent users from downloading and installing malicious smartphone applications, several countries and organizations have developed security requirements for smartphone applications and associated vetting systems. Certified third parties can inspect whether an application satisfies applicable security requirements and issue inspection reports to notify users of potential risks. However, currently there is no standard method for users to obtain inspection results. Furthermore, as the advances of hacking techniques, a inspecter may discover that an application is vulnerable to a new type of attack and wish to notify application users immediately. To address the issue, this study proposes a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework for smartphone applications security (SCIRM) to enable smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of interested applications with smart contracts. Benefiting from blockchain technology, users can obtain historical inspection reports of an application and verify the integrity of the reports. In addition, this study utilizes smart contract technology to implement the interfaces so that smart contracts will enforce the related actions automatically. This study can hopefully contribute to enabling users to adopt appropriate countermeasures to potential application security risks as users can obtain up-to-dated security information about applications timely.

AB In this paper, we present a novel methodology to integrate the Blockchain technology in the food industry supply chain to allow traceability along the process and provide the ultimate customer with enough information about the origin of the product to make an informed purchase decision. This methodology gathers the best practices in marketing, process engineering and the technology itself, alongside with the authors' experience during its application in the organic coffee industry in the Colombian market. The Authors extracted the best out of the best practices and made it simple for anyone interested in its uses and application. The result is a simple and easy methodology that suits any product, supply chain, and required system configurations; due to its versatility and adaptability.

AB With the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it can collect and store various types of data in the cloud everyday. However, since the vast amount of data collected by IoT devices is very closely related to individuals, careful management of this data is required. Previously, we proposed a control mechanism for live migration with data regulations preservation that solved the problem of unintentional and inappropriate movement of data due to Virtual Machine (VM) migration on the cloud. However, if the license information of the country or organization used in the proposed method has been tampered with malicious intent, there's a possibility that inappropriate data movement will occur. In this paper, we proposed an improved data protection mechanism that can prevent malicious tampering during VM migration on the cloud using blockchain technology. Initial experimental results shows that the proposed mechanism incurs minute overhead and almost no influence on the migration processing time. Consequently, this will support reliable compliance of the conditions licensed by the owner of the data, the laws of the country, and the regulations of the organization.

AB We present Strain, a new auction protocol running on top of blockchains and guaranteeing bid confidentiality against fully-malicious parties. As our goal is efficiency and low blockchain latency, we abstain from using traditional, highly interactive MPC primitives such as secret shares. We focus on a slightly weaker adversary model than MPC which allows Strain to achieve constant latency in both the number of parties and the bid length. The main idea behind Strain is a new maliciously-secure two-party comparison mechanism executed between any pair of bids in parallel. Using zero-knowledge proofs, Strain broadcasts the outcome of comparisons on the blockchain in a way that all parties can verify each outcome. Strain's latency is not only asymptotically optimal, but also efficient in practice, requiring a total of just 4 blocks of the underlying blockchain. Strain provides typical auction security requirements such as non-retractable bids against fully-malicious adversaries.

AB With the promotion of power energy market reform, it has been a trend to allow distributed energy agents and other multi-subject agents to participate in the market competition. However, due to the existing power market mechanism is designed according to the centralized power supply mode, the public services, power market transaction mechanism and government management system for distributed energy transaction is still more missing. The blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, transparency, fairness, openness and so on. Under the background of the transactive energy system, a decentralized distributed energy transaction mechanism based on blockchain smart contract technology is proposed, which includes auditing, bidding, clearing and settlement. It realizes P2P energy trading among prosumers.

ID SYSTEMS
AB With the increasing difficulty of solo mining in blockchain mining, pool mining has become more and more popular, and most of the miners would like to join a mining pool and contribute their computational power to the pool. When the pool finds a valid block and get the reward from the blockchain network, it will distribute the reward to its miners according to its reward mechanism. In practice, the Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) mechanism is one of the most commonly used mechanisms by pools, and the pool adopting PPLNS mechanism will distribute the reward to the miners whose reported shares are in the last N shares, according to their proportion of the number of shares in the last N shares. In the PPLNS mechanism, different reporting strategies may bring different rewards for miners. Thus, how to report their found shares to the pool has become an important issue faced by the miners. In this paper, we study the share reporting problem faced by the miners in PPLNS pools, and establish a share reporting optimization model for the miners. We also study the effect of the parameter N in the PPLNS mechanism on the optimal reporting strategies of the miners. With the computational experiments approach, we design experiments to evaluate our proposed share reporting strategies. This work is the first attempt to study the share reporting issue faced by miners in PPLNS pools, and it can provide useful managerial insights for miners when making their share reporting decisions in such pools.

AB With the increasing development and adoption of wearable devices, people care more about their health conditions than ever before. Both patients and doctors as well as insurance agencies benefit from this advanced technology. However, the emerging wearable devices creates a major concern over health data privacy as data collected from those devices can reflect patients' heath conditions and habits, and could increase the data disclosure risks among the healthcare providers and application vendors. In this paper, we propose using the trusted execution platform enabled by Intel SGX to provide accountability for data access and propose a decentralized approach with blockchain technology to address the privacy concern. By developing a web application for personal health data management (PHDM) systems, the individuals are capable of synchronizing sensor data from wearable devices with online account and controlling data access from any third parties. The protected personal health data and data access records are hashed and anchored to a permanent but secure ledger with platform dependency, ensuring data integrity and accountability. Analysis shows that our approach provides user privacy and accountability with acceptable overhead.

AB This study proposes a privacy preserving Blockchain-Based Ticketing Service (BB Tickets), which stores information about events and related tickets in the blockchain network. As the blockchain technologies can ensure information integrity, ticket buyers can use the data stored in the blockchain network to ensure the authenticity of the purchased tickets and to resolve related disputes. Furthermore, the Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) scheme is utilized in the proposed system to protect user privacy. Therefore, this study contributes to providing a privacy-preserving means for users to enjoy the reliable ticketing service provided by the blockchain technologies.

DE Blockchain; Bitcoin; Proof-of-Work
AB Bitcoin has utilized Proof-of-Work(PoW), which prevents double-spend attack in the distributed network. PoW is a consensus protocol that depends on a computing power, therefore it is highly difficult for malicious nodes to attack. However, emerging a group called mining pool encourage the centralization of computing power. This may make it easy to tamper with a distributed ledger called Blockchain of Bitcoin.
   In this paper, we propose the new protocol which evaluates computing power for each nodes and adjusts difficulty of generating a block based on the evaluation. This gives an equal opportunity for successful mining. Furthermore, reward for user's incentive is also adjusted based on the evaluation.

DE SHA-2; Blockchain; Thread level Parallelism; L3 cache
AB SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). It has a one way compression function using the Davies-Meyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher. SHA-2 is utilized in secured network communications, blockchain applications etc. The mining ware of crypto currency also applies SHA-2 today. To enhance the hash rate computation power, the type of processor is changed from CPU to GPU and ASIC for different currencies. But, the issues are too much energy consumption and heavy heat from processing units. This paper's approach to enhance the hash rate computation is with higher efficiency computer resource management by L3 cache. SHA 2 application generates hash block continuously and store the block in to nearest register or cache memory. But multiple thread process configuration might create instruction stall by cache miss. We implemented L3 cache layer in the code of SHA 2 mining ware and designed higher Thread level Parallelism (TLP) inside. The result shows 531.54% higher than original mining ware program.

AB Land & property can be identified as one of the core assets in any county in the world. Governments spend significant amount of money to identify, define, manage and maintain the transactional information around land and property in a country. Creating a proper mechanism to make this information available to the public users can be considered as one of the key indications that shows the development of a country. The system currently in use to record land and property transactions in Sri Lanka is a book-based system where all the information is stored in handwritten folios. This method is inefficient, time consuming, unsecured and complex when compared to the advanced systems which are used by developed countries in the world. This study is carried out to find a secured, efficient, cost effective solution with regards to the concerns and other problems related to land and property transactions in Sri Lanka. Proposed solution includes a decentralized ledger to record land and property transactions which runs on top of blockchain technology. All new transaction entries will be validated by smart contracts to verify the validity of the transactions. After performing a proper consensus mechanism, the transaction records will be stored in cryptographically secured blocks. So, the data integrity could not be violated. Additionally, investors and the land buyers can get information about the current market trends & predictions before buying or investing into a land. Also, the proposed system supports the users to view the land information graphically and allows the system users to view the desired land parcels without physically going to the actual location via the geographical information system.

AB Blockchain shows a huge prospective in the coming future. It is a technology that provides the possibility of generating and sharing transaction ledgers that are tamper proof. Use cases of Blockchain are enlarging in numbers and width in multiple areas like, Internet of Things (IoT), finance and security. Even though many public and private sectors are introducing this technology, it remains a fear to others due to their lack of familiarity and the point of it not taking any big role in any major security enterprises till now. In this paper we will explain what is a blockchain and define its characteristics, benefits, and the differences between them. And help in choosing the suitable type that accommodates your needs. Then we present the immutability aspect of blockchain and its benefits and compare it with a traditional database. And finally, we will discuss blockchain security (For public and private blockchains) and compare it with a standard cyber security environment and discuss both of them in different cyber-attack scenarios.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and it realizes the circulation and distribution of cryptocurrency via miners contributing their computational power to solve a cryptographic puzzle. With more and more people participating in Bitcoin mining, the continuous growing of the computational power might greatly reduce the time for finding a new valid block. To keep the stability of the Bitcoin system, the difficulty of the Bitcoin network will be adjusted every 2016 blocks. This paper aims to study the principles of the difficulty adjustment of the whole Bitcoin blockchain network in Bitcoin mining. We first describe the computing process of the target and thus the difficulty of a block, and then study its influence factors and their effect on the difficulty. After that, we study the adjustment of the difficulty, and propose a framework for the adjustment of the difficulty that can be easily used in practice. Our work can help researchers better understand the principles of Bitcoin mining.
