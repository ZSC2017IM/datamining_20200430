AB Blockchain, an immutable ledger or database shared by peers in a network, is comprised of records of events or transactions that are appended chronologically. Introduced via Bitcoin to the world, blockchain is increasingly being accepted and adopted in different industries and for diverse use cases. Among key industries, health care offers several significant opportunities for applying blockchain conceptualization. Chief areas for health care blockchain applications include electronic medical records management, pharmaceutical supply chain management, biomedical research and education, remote patient monitoring, health insurance claim processing, and health data analytics. Even so, applying blockchain concepts in health care is not without challenges, including interoperability, security-privacy, scalability-speed, and stakeholders' engagement issues. While these challenges may militate against blockchain applications in health care, there are possible countermeasures and implementation techniques, which if adhered to, can reasonably contain many aspects of such challenges.

AB The purpose was to help investment banks select customers with good credit, exclude customers with greater risk, minimize the risk of investors, and maintain the maximum interests of investors. The data mining technology was used to establish a credit risk assessment model of personal to personal peer-to-peer (P2P) network lending, and then the credit situation of the lender was accurately assessed to reduce the risk of the platform. Firstly, the loan data of LendingClub (LC) platform in 2018 were collected and sorted out, and then the unbalanced data set was obtained through preprocessing. Secondly, the unbalanced data set was sampled by layers, and 10 balanced data sets were obtained, and the four indexes of evaluation were obtained through data classification, that is, P2P platform credit rating evaluation index. Finally, the actual data of LC platform were evaluated by decision tree and binomial logic regression algorithm. The CfsSubsetEval evaluation strategy and BestFirst search strategy were used to search for a single feature to improve the prediction ability, so as to analyze the credit rating of the lender. The research results showed that the decision tree algorithm could improve the accuracy of preliminary screening, and predict the default probability of borrowers more accurately, so as to filter out the borrowers with higher default rate and reduce the loan risk of the platform, while the binomial logistic regression algorithm could show good performance. The combination of the two algorithms can truly estimate the credit status of the lenders and improve the transaction efficiency. Therefore, the research on the credit risk of blockchain platform based on data mining technology is of great significance to improve the credit level of investors, improve their investment income, save transaction costs, optimize the allocation of credit resources, and achieve effective supervision by credit regulatory authorities.

AB The purpose of this study is to solve the problems of large number of iterations, limitations and poor fitting effect of traditional algorithms in predicting the yield rate of blockchain financial products. In this study, bitcoin yield rate is taken as the research object, and data from June 2, 2016 to December 30, 2018 are collected, totaling 943 pieces. The BP neural network, support vector regression machine algorithm and particle swarm optimization least square vector algorithm are respectively adopted to carry out model simulation and empirical analysis on the collected data, and it is concluded that particle swarm optimization least square vector algorithm has the best fitting effect. Subsequently, the Ethereum (ETH) yield rate is selected as the research object, and the model simulation and empirical analysis are carried out on it, which verifies that the optimized algorithm has better prediction and fitting on the time series. The results show that the particle swarm optimization algorithm among the three algorithms mentioned in this research has the best prediction effect. Therefore, the results of this study have a good fitting effect on the prediction of the yield rate of blockchain financial products, have a good guiding effect on the investors of blockchain financial products, and have a good guiding significance for the study of the yield rate of China's blockchain financial products.

AB In order to study the use of in-depth learning to process financial data, it is proposed that the related technology of neural network and deep learning can be applied to financial data, and real stock index and futures data can be used to explore the application effect of neural network and in-depth learning. Firstly, the theory and model of in-depth learning and neural network are introduced in detail. Secondly, a simple neural network and in-depth learning model are used in the stock index and futures price forecast. The data used in the input of the model include the price of a stock in the current trading and some data indicators, and the closing price of a stock in the next time. The decline will be reflected in output. If the output is up for 1 and down for 0, new data will be input after the training of the model. Finally, the output data can be compared with the real data to judge the application effect of the model, after comparing e and analyzing the application effect of the model. The results show that the research in this study can help investors to build an automated investment model and the investment strategy of the stock market. The construction can be used for reference to improve investors' investment strategy and return rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traceability of ingredients in food supply chains has become paramount in a world in which markets become global, heterogeneous, and complex and in which consumers expect a high level of quality. The food supply chain consists of many organizations having different interests and are often reluctant to share traceability information with each other. Blockchain has been advocated for improving traceability by providing trust. Yet, practice proved to be more stubborn. The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability. Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews. Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business, regulation, quality and traceability categories have been identified. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains, whereas others were found to be supply chain specific. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used. Our findings imply that supply chain systems have first to be modified and organizational measures need to be taken to fulfill the boundary conditions, before blockchain can be used successfully.

AB This paper aims to explain the implementation of blockchain technology in the production and supply chain delivery system for eggs from farm to consumer by a company based in the Midwestern USA. One of the primary research questions answered is how blockchain can be utilized and applied to more accurately and transparently move goods through global supply chains. This company is at the forefront of developing such systems for use in industry, and a use case for egg distribution is detailed. The goal is to track products from farm to fork using blockchain and internet of things (IoT) enabled technologies. By creating traceable and transparent supply chains for food, consumers can attain the information they need to make informed choices about the food they buy and the companies they support. For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency builds better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss. The blockchain technology and this business are creating a case for fixing and transforming the world's food system.

AB This paper investigates the major implications of blockchain technology for operations management (OM) with a focus on the decision-making processes in supply chain management (SCM) from the perspective of sustainable performance. The links between blockchain technology, OM, and sustainability issues within SCM are analysed. This two-step research study includes a broad review of the main contributions in the literature that have focused on blockchain technology and OM in SCM. It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sustainable performance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports, and the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure investigated successfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the main blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main players in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and uncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high level of sustainable performance.
   Although the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM, these new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a real forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article adds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and sustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy.

AB Blockchain Technology (BT) has led to a disruption in the supply chain by removing the trust related issues. Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs.

AB Permissioned blockchain utilized by any organization is commonly known as Enterprise Blockchain (EBC). EBC represents a popular investment option as enterprise system in the service industry. This paper aims at analyzing the perception of EBC among practitioners in service industry. As significant hype prevails about EBC usefulness in service industry, we examine if the perception of the usefulness of EBC among practitioners is borne out of knowledge of theoretical benefits of EBC, or is it borne out of the hype. A scale for measuring EBC benefits is developed. In order to test the hypothesized relationships, structural equation modelling (SEM) is used. We extend the concept of perceived usefulness from technology acceptance model for service supply chain management (SCM) and measure the perceived usefulness of EBC for six supply chain dimensions in the service industry. We examine if the service industry managers perceive EBC to be profitable based on the practical usefulness of EBC in various dimensions of service SCM. Moderating effects of 5 factors are analysed on relationships of our research model. This paper provides insights about the dimensions of service SCM, in which service industry practitioners perceive EBC to be useful and may contribute to increment in organization's profitability.

AB Blockchain technology provides us a new tool to solve the product traceability problem in supply chain management. This research focuses on the cross-border e-commerce context, to propose a blockchain-based framework, and develop a set of corresponding techniques and methods for achieving traceable products and transactions in supply chain management. A general blockchain-based product traceability framework is introduced. This framework is based on a cross-border e-commerce supply chain context, incorporating a series of blockchain-based models, including multi-chain structure model, data management model and block structure model. Several core methods and algorithms are also developed, such as information anchoring method, key distribution method, information encryption algorithm and anti-counterfeiting method. The framework, models and methods form a complete and comprehensive solution, which are evaluated by applying to several typical problems and attack cases. The case analysis results show that the framework, models and methods can successfully deal with key recover problem, and protect against clone attack, counterfeit tag attack and counterfeit product attack. The effectiveness, extendibility, security, implementation and governance issues of applying these solutions are also discussed. This research contributes to the theoretical and practical literatures on blockchain technology, cross-border e-commerce and supply chain management research fields.

AB As a new type of disruptive internet technology, blockchain technology is widely used as a technical support for enterprises to improve production processes and reduce costs. This paper reveals that existing research has only focused on the business process modelling and technology design process of a blockchain-based solution and has neglected analysis of the relationship between blockchain technology and enterprise operational capabilities based on actual data. Hence, this paper collects 50 listed blockchain technology enterprises in China and quantitatively analyses them. The results show that the expansion of the enterprise asset scale is a significant driving factor for implementing blockchain technology. In addition, this paper proves that implementation of blockchain technology has a positive impact on improving asset turnover rate and reducing sales expense rate. Based on the results of theoretical and empirical analysis, this paper provides some constructive suggestions for constructing blockchain projects in the future.

AB The economic development of rural India requires connecting remote villages to local and global supply chains. Yet, high rates of financial exclusion inhibit rural Indians from participating in these supply networks. We review the literature on financial inclusion, adoption, and blockchain in India, and posit that to resolve financial exclusion, the four challenges of geographical access, high cost, inappropriate banking products, and financial illiteracy need to be overcome. Next, we argue that blockchain technologies hold the potential to overcome most of these challenges. However, for blockchain technologies to become the cornerstone of financial inclusion initiatives, an understanding of technology adoption in India is needed. To guide the development of such understanding, we develop a research agenda on the antecedents of adoption, adoption patterns, and outcomes of adoption. Answering these research questions will lead to a nuanced understanding of adoption of blockchain-based technologies in rural India. The practical contribution of this paper is the discussion of how blockchain can alleviate the issue of financial exclusion in rural India, thereby providing a basis for a solution that could connect rural Indians to global supply chain networks. The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of knowledge gaps that should be answered to achieve financial inclusion of rural Indians.

AB Blockchain technology is said to have a high disruptive potential and can do without an intermediary. Numerous contributions deal with its impact on and possibilities for logistics and supply chains. In this article, we use a multiple case analysis to develop an explanatory model for the interaction of actors in an operational supply chain involving blockchain technology. In addition, we show which intermediary tasks the blockchain could replace and what impact this would have on the industry logic. For this purpose, we analyze the status quo in practice based on a multiple case study with real use cases and find answers to our research questions. The findings of the paper include (1) insights into the impact of blockchain technology on the logistics industry, and (2) the implications and research questions related to blockchain technology and the impact of blockchain technology on business models.

AB Blockchain technologies have captured the imagination of scholars, managers, and practitioners around the world. It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability, as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves performance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal. Finally, we provide future research directions and a guide for the papers presented in this Special Issue.

It includes an overview of the evolution of e-government, a synopsis of existing applications of blockchain technology, and innovative blockchain developments. We utilize the Confidentiality-Integrity-Accessibility (CIA) triad to guide our discussion of the security, governance, and regulatory implications of this technology. Leveraging the CIA triad model, we provide context for public managers who may consider blockchain technologies, and we highlight certain advantages arising from the "non-reputability" of distributed ledgers.
   In particular, we highlight the advantages of blockchain technologies with regards to non-reputability to help public managers understand how to best leverage blockchain technology to transform operations.

AB This study aims to investigate the effects of relative advantage, complexity, upper management support, cost, market dynamics, competitive pressure and regulatory support on blockchain adoption for operations and supply chain management among Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. Unlike existing studies that employed linear models with Technology Acceptance Model or United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology that ignores the organisational and environmental factors, we adopted the Technology, Organisation and Environment Framework that covers the technological dimensions of relative advantage and complexity, organisational dimensions of upper management support and cost and environmental dimensions of market dynamics, competitive pressure and regulatory support. Empirical data from 194 SMEs were investigated and ranked using a nonlinear non-compensatory PLS-ANN approach. Competitive pressure, complexity, cost and relative have significant effects on behavioural intention. Market dynamics, regulatory support and upper management support were insignificant predictors. SMEs often lack resources for technological investments but faces same requirements for streamlining business processes to optimise returns and blockchain presents a viable option for SMEs' sustainability due to its features of immutability, transparency and security that have the potential to revolutionise businesses. This study contributes new knowledge to the literature on factors that affect blockchain adoption and justifications were discussed accordingly.

AB Immunization is an indispensable mechanism for preventing infectious diseases in modern society, and vaccine safety is closely related to public health and national security. However, issues such as vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud are still widespread in vaccine supply chains. Therefore, an effective management system for the supervision of vaccine supply chains is urgently required. As the next generation of core technology after the Internet, blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods. Meanwhile, the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems. The main objective of this study is to develop a "vaccine blockchain" system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies. This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines.

AB Real-time tracking and tracing are important in providing a unified view of global supply chains consisting of several parties. This paper illustrates the needs and requirements for managing supply chains in multi-company project environments by adopting various tracking and tracing technologies. This kind of tracking and tracing is especially needed within distributed architectures engaged in project-based businesses, where several vendors are involved in a single project. Such tracking and tracing data can be used extensively to generate key performance indicators, which can be used to measure and control supply chain processes. This paper also proposes a pilot system of a cloud-based portal for real-time tracking and tracing of logistics and supply chains. This portal is formed by the combination of RFID, IoT and blockchain technology into an integrated real-time view. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and IoT (Internet of Things) provides real-time information or data, while blockchain technology is used to provide a chain of immutable transactions. The architecture of the proposed portal system is connected to transport companies, tracking devices, consolidation points and suppliers. The pilot study also illustrates the benefits and advantages of such a portal system.

AB Product lifecycle management (PLM) aims to seamlessly manage all products and information and knowledge generated throughout the product lifecycle for achieving business competitiveness. Conventionally, PLM is implemented based on standalone and centralized systems provided by software vendors. The information of PLM is hardly to be integrated and shared among the cooperating parties. It is difficult to meet the requirements of the openness, interoperability and decentralization of the Industry 4.0 era. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle.

AB Social sustainability is a major concern in global supply chains for protecting workers from exploitation and for providing a safe working environment. Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively. System implementation cost and potential challenges are analyzed before the research is concluded.

AB In order to effectively measure the risk of China's block-chain financial market, in this study, combined with KMV model, which is widely used in the world, the risk prediction model suitable for China's financial market has been found under the revision of particle swarm optimization algorithm. Based on the analysis of the data of more than 2,900 A-share companies in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the optimal shortterm liabilities and the optimal long-term liabilities coefficients of 3.68 and 1.72 for China's financial market have been found. Through empirical analysis and verification, the ROC curve shows that the short-term debt and long-term debt coefficients 1 and 0.5 of the traditional KMV model cannot distinguish ST shares from non-ST shares in China's financial market, while 3.68 and 1.72 can distinguish very well. It is proved that the modified KMV model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm can identify the credit risk of Listed Companies in China's block chain financial market very well.

AB Based on the key metrics to monitor energy sector improvements from the International Energy Agency (IEA), transport emissions must decrease 43% by 2030. Freight logistics operations in Europe are struggling with ways to reduce their carbon footprints in order to adhere to regulations on governing logistics, while providing the increasing demand for sustainable products from the customers. This study investigates the anonymised microdata from the European Road Freight Transport Survey (2011-2014) to acquire patterns in logistic operations based on over 11 million journeys within 27 EU and EFTA countries involved. Different algorithms were implemented (Horizontal Cooperation, Pooling and Physical Internet) to analyse efficiency, in terms of vehicle utilisation, degree of vehicles' loading during each journey and sustainability in terms of the amount of CO2 emissions per journey. This study shows that existing data can provide invaluable information on the efficiency of logistics operations and the positive effects data analytics can provide. Physical Internet algorithm has performed better in terms of reducing emissions and improving the logistics' efficiency, especially when the sample sizes are large, but this would require a shift to an open global supply web.

AB In Bitcoin system, a transaction is given a priority value according to its attributes such as the remittance amount and fee, and transactions with high priorities are likely to be confirmed faster than those with low priorities. In this paper, we analyze the transaction-confirmation time for Bitcoin system. We model the transaction-confirmation process as a queueing system with batch service, M/G(B)/1. We consider the joint distribution of numbers of transactions in system and the elapsed service time, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. Using the result, we derive the recursive formulae of mean transaction-confirmation times of an M/G(B)/1 queue with priority service discipline. In numerical examples, we show the effect of the maximum block size on the mean transaction-confirmation time, investigating the accuracy region of our queueing model. We also discuss how the increase in micropayments, which are likely to be given low priorities, affects the transaction-confirmation time.

TI Blockchain-based fair payment smart contract for public cloud storage

AB Cloud storage plays an important role in today's cloud ecosystem. Increasingly clients tend to outsource their data to the cloud. In spite of its copious advantages, integrity has always been a significant issue. The audit method is commonly used to ensure integrity in cloud scenarios. However, traditional auditing schemes expect a third-party auditor (TPA), which is not always available in the real world. Also, the former scheme implies a limited pay-as-you-go service, as it requires the client to pay for the service in advance. In this paper, we aim to address the aforementioned drawback by adopting blockchain to replace TPA and designing a blockchain-based fair payment smart contract for public cloud storage auditing. In our system, data owner and cloud service provider (CSP) will run a blockchain-based smart contract. The contract ensures that the CSP is required to submit data possession proof regularly. The CSP gets paid only if the verification is passed; otherwise, it gets no remuneration but has to pay the penalties. To reduce the number of interactions in the execution of contract, we present the notion of non-interactive public provable data possession and design a blockchain-based smart contract for public cloud storage auditing based on this primitive.

AB Vehicular named data networking (VNDN) has recently emerged as a novel paradigm to facilitate content-centric data sharing for Internet of Vehicles. However, an information holder can spread fake data to clients for malicious purposes, which may affect the driving decision of the recipient, or even worse, cause traffic congestion and accidents. In this article, we build a data-sharing system that consists of a double-layer blockchain. The nodes at the bottom layer request for service by announcing their requirements in the NDN paradigm. For the upper layer, the nodes submit their demands and supplies to the nearest roadside unit for further matching. We model the balance between the demand and supply as a matching game. To encourage nodes to provide positive services, a reputation management mechanism that combines negative and positive transaction records is proposed. Simulation results verify the validity of our system, and the data-sharing mechanism fosters a secure information interaction in the VNDN.

AB Personal privacy disclosure is one of the most serious challenges in smart industrial applications. Anonymous authentication is an effective solution to protect personal privacy. However, the existing anonymous credential protocols are not perfectly suitablefor smart industrial environments such as smart vehicles in the sense that the credential revocation issue is not well-solved. In this article, we propose a Blockchain-based Anonymous authentication with Selective revocation for Smart industrial applications (BASS) for smart industrial applications supporting attribute privacy, selective revocation, credential soundness, and multishowing-unlinkability. Specifically, an efficient selective revocation mechanism is proposed based on dynamic accumulators and the signature algorithm due to Pointcheval and Sanders as the overlay of the BASS. According to the diverse demands of credential authorities, BASS can selectively provide revocation of credentials or revocation of users. We extend BASS from single-attribute privacy to multiattribute privacy as well. Finally, we implement a prototype to evaluate the cryptographic core primitives of BASS by deploying smart contracts in Ethereum to demonstrate the validity of BASS in smart industrial applications.

AB The Internet of things (IoT) presents new opportunities and challenges due to its scale and dynamic nature. One significant challenge for the IoT is the need for security, in particular access control solutions, that are designed to meet the characteristics of these systems. Delegation of rights, from one entity to another, is a crucial component of an access control system. The IoT requires a secure, flexible, and fine-grained delegation model. While there has been considerable work in the area of delegation, much of it assumes a centralized, well-resourced system and these solutions have limited capacity in the context of the IoT. Where delegation models for the IoT have been proposed they typically provide only coarse-grained control over the delegation of rights. Moreover, many of them require a centralized trusted authority, which can suffer from a single-point failure and is not an ideal base for a large and dynamic system like the IoT. In this paper, we propose an identity-less, asynchronous, and decentralized delegation model for the IoT based on blockchain technology. We describe system components, architecture, and key aspects related to the security of the system. We use attributes to validate an entity rather than depending upon unique identities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model through use-case examples and analyze the performance with a proof of concept testbed implementation using Ethereum private blockchain.

ID DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION
AB Demand Response (DR) is progressively moving from a centralized, unidirectional structure to a set of advanced decentralized mechanisms that better balance distributed supply and demand. This paper presents a decentralized cooperative DR framework to manage the daily energy exchanges within a community of Smart-Buildings, in the presence of local Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The proposed algorithm taps into the flexibility of the participants to let them decide of a day-ahead community power profile, and subsequently ensures the forecast tracking during the next day. In practice, the algorithm is fully decentralized by the Blockchain technology, that enables a trusted communication medium among the participants and enforces autonomous monitoring and billing via Smart-Contracts. With such an energy management framework, participating Smart-Buildings can together aim at a common objective, such as carbon-free resources usage or aggregated grid services, without depending on a centralized aggregator/utility. Simulations on realistic Swiss building models demonstrate that nearly all the renewable production resources could be harnessed locally through the presented framework, compared to selfish individual optimization. Under a quadratic cost of grid electricity, the considered community profile could dramatically be flattened, hence avoiding costly peaks at the grid interface. A scalability analysis shows that, considering the current public Ethereum Blockchain, the framework could handle a community size of up to 100 Smart-Buildings.

AB Purpose The main objective of this paper is to justify the implementation of blockchain (BC) over the traditional method deployed in the supply chain (SC) after using the fuzzy-analytic network process (fuzzy-ANP) application. Over the past two decades, the overall product cost is affected by the SC at a global level. Organizations are working on their existing SC for improving their performance. BC technology is a newly emerging technology and magnetizes the attention of researchers and industrialists. This technology is still at the initial stage, and only little investigation is available in the literature and it has not been much investigated by researchers. Design/methodology/approach Literature and expert opinion interpretation in BC characteristics are further analyzed and modeled using fuzzy-interpretive structural modeling (fuzzy-ISM), fuzzy-MICMAC and fuzzy-ANP. The combined approach of both fuzzy-ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC is applied to identify the common drivers to integrate the BC technology in the light of efficient supply chain management (SCM). Findings Comparative analysis between traditional and BC-based supply chain (BCSC) using fuzzy-ANP is carried out, considering the common driving characteristics. The proposed integrated (combined) approach of fuzzy-ISM, fuzzy-MICMAC and Fuzzy-ANP found that integration of BC with SCM is better prioritized than traditional supply chain management (TSCM). The findings in the article endorse that the TSCM can be made efficient by integrating the BC technology considering five most driving characteristics, namely, data safety and decentralization, accessibility, documentation, data management and quality. Originality/value The current proposed research work identifies 12 characteristics after studying numerous literature reviews and having a discussion with SC experts with knowledge of BC. The integrated approach of fuzzy-ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC is implemented here. After that, fuzzy-ANP is used to give ranking among BCSCM and TSCM. The study carried out in this article motivates industries to implement BC in their SC system. It will reduce the transaction cost, documentation work, save time and eliminate human error at the national and international levels. The common characteristics identified in this proposed work would help in managerial decisions for the adoption of BC to ensure that the system becomes more transparent, easily traceable and finally improve the performance.

AB Purpose Blockchain is expected to have a significant impact on Systems of Innovation as the new General Purpose Technology. The purpose of this study is to investigate how Blockchain can revolutionise the Systems of Innovation by investigating its overall structure, actors and relationships. Design/methodology/approach This study used the systematic mapping method to explore and integrate the Blockchain and Systems of Innovation literature for the creation of a new conceptual model of Blockchain-enabled Systems of Innovation. In that scope, 37 Blockchain-related and 32 Systems of Innovation-related papers, besides two major books in the field of Blockchain, have been reviewed and then integrated based on the Systems Thinking approach. Findings The key findings for Blockchain-enabled Systems of Innovation are that there is (1) an increased distribution of networks and collaborations, (2) increased trust through the use of reputation systems, (3) an emerging new nature of platform characteristics, (4) a democratisation of entrepreneurship by the new funding landscape and (5) an increased significance of technological drivers, such as energy. Practical Implications Blockchain appears to reduce the effects of distrust in collaborative innovation practices with its consensus mechanisms and the new Blockchain-enabled Systems of Innovation is expected to revolutionise the interactions in the future. Originality/value There are very few studies that have been found to integrate innovation management practices with Blockchain. This is the first Blockchain-based Systems of Innovation study enabling the fundamental revision of its structure, types of relationships and actors.

AB With the development of the knowledge economy, science and technology play an increasingly crucial role in social development. Investment from the government and the enterprise in scientific research has increased significantly, and the number of scientific research projects has also shown an obvious upward trend. Due to the lack of a standardized and unified scientific research project management program, many projects are overdue or even failed, and project fund management is confused. Besides, output results are limited and the actual conversion rate is low. In this paper, we propose a scientific research project management system based on consortium blockchain. Firstly, the process of scientific research project management is standardized. According to this specification, we then design a scientific research project management system in line with consortium blockchain, the smart contract, and the IPFS system. By using these technologies, we have coped with two major problems in traditional scientific project management: breach of contract and confidentiality. The simulation results show that compared with the conventional scientific research project management, the scheme proposed in this paper can significantly enhance the efficiency and the success rate of the project, and reduce the time and manpower consumed in the process of project implementation.

AB A blockchain is resistant to modification based on the consensus of the network majority, which requires a large amount of communication among distributed nodes. Existing data dissemination protocol solves the wrong block problem also at a high communication cost. This paper investigates the error-correcting tamper-proofing data storage problem and proposes a three-layer framework to store the data in the blockchain to achieve data integrity. The data are stored as blocks, and we design a two-dimension chain data structure consisting of horizontal and vertical chains. This paper proposes a Rotating multiple random Masters and Error-Correcting data storage framework based on blockchain (RMEC) to strike a trade-off between system decentralization and the amount of communication. The proposed Rotating Multiple Random Sampling consensus mechanism (RMRS) randomly selects multiple temporary master nodes to handle each data access request so as to reduce the communication cost. We also propose two error-correcting mechanisms to validate and correct the wrong data blocks. Finally, we implement a prototype and conduct analyses on the system performance. The experiments demonstrate that the framework can achieve data tamper-proof and effectively reduce the communication cost.

ID POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; BITCOIN; RISK
AB Policy uncertainty created by regulatory authorities regarding the blockchain matters for the initial coin offering (ICO) market. Using an ICO dataset from four major cryptocurrency exchanges, we find that higher policy uncertainty regarding the blockchain leads to a lower return and a lower trading volume of an ICO on its first trading day. Although ICOs are decentralised by design and less vulnerable to direct regulatory intervention, we conclude that blockchain policy uncertainty constitutes an important component of the information environment of ICO ventures.

ID MULTIPARTY COMPUTATION
AB The Bitcoin model originated blockchain architectures and inspired their further development. Blockchain architectures are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. Bitcoin's rewards for Proof of Work mining became the default consensus technique for blockchains. As an alternative to reward mechanisms for blockchain maintenance, we propose punishment mechanisms for neglecting to maintain the blockchain (provided participants are intrinsically motivated to be beneficiaries of the blockchain application). Punishment not Reward is convincing for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, and potential punishment mechanisms include denial of service and/or revocation of confidentiality. This obviates the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem, and market manipulation demerits. The privacy concerns of competing entities participating in a blockchain application are prima facie in conflict with the needs of the community to be able to inflict punishment mechanisms. Conflicts of this kind can be addressed via sophisticated cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, multiparty computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and so on, which play a vital role. We stress the importance of correctly balancing all application specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications, so that the mix of incentives and disincentives is stabilizing.

TI Novel blockchain reference model for government services: Dubai

AB Blockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology, is a disruptive and revolutionary technology that enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need for trusted central authorities. Many industries have taken steps to unleash the potential of blockchain technology, including the government sector, and early adopters are exploring the use of blockchain as one of the critical capabilities needed to create new business models and to radically transform government services and functions. However, despite this interest in adopting Blockchain technology, there is a lack of Blockchain frameworks or reference models/architecture that addresses government services in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain model that can be adopted by governments to establish government-led blockchain ecosystem for government services. The blockchain model is proposed based on the outcomes of our analysis of permissioned blockchain platform, and analysis of blockchain powered housing rentals use case that is being implemented by the Dubai Government. The proposed blockchain model outcomes includes a blockchain governance structure, participants and roles definition, and network architecture design which explains the deployment options and components. We also explain the model lifecycle and blockchain services, and we shed the light on the security and performance of the model. The study also includes exploring many blockchain use cases used by governments through proofs of concept or prototypes. Our analysis of Hyperledger Fabric design features shows the platform's relevance to government services and use cases. The Hyperledger Fabric analysis also identifies the platform's actors, services, processes and data structure of Hyperledger Fabric.

AB The behavioural intention to adopt Blockchain for supply chain management (BCSCM) is studied in this paper. The research framework adopted considers how Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Facilitating Condition (FC), Technology Readiness (TR), Technology Affinity (TA) and Trust (TT) can lead to the adoption of the technology. Data gathered from 157 firms is analysed using SPSS version 2 while the quality of the measurement is tested using WarpPLS. Findings revealed that FC, TR and TA have a positive influence on intention to use BCSCM and regulatory support moderates the effect of FC. This study offers valuable insights into the applicability of Blockchain technology for supply chain management.

TI Autotuning based on frequency scaling toward energy efficiency of

AB Energy-efficient computing is especially important in the field of high-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers. Therefore, automated optimization of energy efficiency during the execution of a compute-intensive program is desirable. In this article, a framework for the automatic improvement of the energy efficiency on NVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing units) using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling is presented. As application, the mining of crypto-currencies is used, since in this area energy efficiency is of particular importance. The framework first determines the energy-optimal frequencies for each available currency on each GPU of a computer automatically. Then, the mining is started, and during a monitoring phase it is ensured that always the most profitable currency is mined on each GPU, using optimal frequencies. Tests with different GPUs show that the energy efficiency, depending on the GPU and the currency, can be increased by up to 84% compared to the usage of the default frequencies. This in turn almost doubles the mining profit.

AB The recent rise in cybersecurity breaches in healthcare organizations has put patients' privacy at a higher risk of being exposed. Despite this threat and the additional danger posed by such incidents to patients' safety, as well as operational and financial threats to healthcare organizations, very few studies have systematically examined the cybersecurity threats in healthcare. To lay a firm foundation for healthcare organizations and policymakers in better understanding the complexity of the issue of cybersecurity, this study explores the major type of cybersecurity threats for healthcare organizations and explains the roles of the four major players (cyber attackers, cyber defenders, developers, and end-users) in cybersecurity. Finally, the paper discusses a set of recommendations for the policymakers and healthcare organizations to strengthen cybersecurity in their organization.

AB In earlier banking systems, the data owners were unable to access or update their financial information. Nowadays, user financial information is stored in Cloud storage instead of traditional storage, but security risks are high in financial sectors. Sometimes, Cloud services providers and public auditors modify the user sensitive attribute values. Hence, the decentralized storage system is required for providing better security and integrity of user sensitive attribute values. Blockchain is a decentralized technology for providing tamper-proof storage for sensitive attribute values. Hence, the account holder information is segregated as sensitive and non-sensitive attributes. Before storing into off-chain mode of blocks, the sensitive attributes are grouped into 'n' number of groups and encrypted by separate group key. The non-encrypted, non-sensitive attributes are stored in cloud storage. The access information is stored in the on-chain mode of the block for easy monitoring. Hence, the security and integrity of sensitive information are preserved.

ID SCHEME
AB Reputation-based consensus algorithms are one of the most promising, but least investigated types of consensus algorithms. Its limitation to persmissioned node identity management shades its potential and causes many applications to find blockchain unsuitable. In this paper, we upgrade PoRX, an existing consensus algorithm, into becoming the first permissionless pure reputation-based consensus algorithm. This upgrade is highly potential since it only affects the admission process and does not intervene with the consensus process, thus can be extended into other types of consensus algorithms.

AB Household photovoltaic (HPV) prosumers and the community photovoltaic (CPV) system have been growing rapidly with the development of the sustainable technology. The uncertainties of these distributed renewable energy resources bring a significant challenge to the design of power-market mechanism and the energy dispatch of the power system for promoting energy efficiency. It is essential to develop a novel efficient energy management strategy for addressing this challenge from the perspective of community prosumers. Accordingly, a risk aversion energy sharing model based on a devised local energy market is presented. A stochastic game is established to minimize prosumers' energy costs and the weighted conditional value-at-risk of energy sharing loss of uncertain CPV through optimal energy sharing profiles. The household loads and HPV outputs are considered as stochastic parameters in the game model. Moreover, a sample weighted average approximation (SWAA) method is proposed for a better estimation of the stochastic game while the SWAA equilibrium is obtained by a relaxation method-based algorithm with theoretical proof. In addition, the blockchain technology is introduced as a distributed and secure way to facilitate the energy sharing model. The case studies show the efficiency of the proposed energy sharing model and the algorithm.

AB Purpose Blockchain technology (BT) is setting world-shattering standard in all type of transactions in business. BT has the prospective to drastically transform supply chain (SC). The main challenge is to enhance trust among the SC stakeholders. This paper aims to identify and prioritize the factors and its challenges that influence the adoptability of BT in SC. The prioritization of these factors will be helpful to the practitioners to decide the strategy of implementing the BT in SC. Design/methodology/approach The factors influencing adoption of BT are identified from the review of literature and expert opinion is used to rank the factors influencing the adoptability of BT in SC using grey relational analysis (GRA). Findings We identified and prioritized key factors: inter-organizational trust and relational governance as organizational challenge, data transparency and data immutability as technological challenge, interoperability and product type as operational challenge and social influence and behavioral intention as social challenge that influences adoptability of BT in SC. Originality/value The priority of these factors will guide future researchers and industry practitioners to plan rational and financial strategy for implementing BT in SC.

AB With the rise of cryptocurrency tokens as a new asset class, the question of the fair evaluation of a cryptocurrency token has become a question of increasing importance. We estimate the pricing kernel with which users price factors affecting their token holdings. We investigate how traditional risk factors such as market risk are evaluated, as well as how blockchain specific risk factors are priced in. In order to do so, we introduce an asset pricing model and modify its properties to make it applicable to cryptocurrency markets. We group the risk factors into market related and Bitcoin- and Ethereum blockchain specific risk factors. We find that blockchain specific risk factors are priced in. There is evidence that risk factors have moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum specific risk factors with an increasing importance of market factors, providing evidence for a decoupling of on-chain and off-chain trading activity.

AB This research investigates the conceptual foundations of the fourth industrial revolution 4.0, its key technologies, and analyzes the development of digital technologies and IT products in the economy of recent years. The paper expands the understanding of the impact of digital technology on Russian business, the emergence of new professions and the obsolescence of a number of existing ones, due to the digitalization of the economy. According to McKinsey research, the potential effect of the commercialization of digital technologies in the Russian economy can reach 19-34% of the total increase in GDP by 2025. This paper aims to address this issue. The paper explains that the Russian economy has sufficient capacity to carry out a digital transformation with the goal of global integration into the global economic space. The paper finds that the implementation of the planned program "Digital Economy of the Russian Federation" today needs the formation of a national theory of digital economy, recognition and legislative regulation of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, as well as stimulation of the formation of digital platform companies of the global scale.

AB Due to the remarkable boost in cryptocurrency trading on digital blockchain platforms, the utilization of advanced machine learning systems for robust prediction of highly nonlinear and noisy data, gains further popularity by individual and institutional market agents. The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast. The overall superiority of artificial neural networks is due to parallel processing features that efficiently emulate human decision-making in the presence of underlying nonlinear input-output relationships in noisy signal environments.

AB In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50% in scenarios including grid constraints.

AB Blockchain is the latest 'disruptive innovation' that has caught scholars' attention. It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.

TI A fair selection protocol for committee-based permissionless blockchains

   Fairness; Mining
AB Committee-based blockchain consensus protocols combine permissionless consensus and classical state machine replication protocols to process transactions efficiently. Due to corruptions by the adversary, reconfiguration mechanisms have to be deployed to update committee members. How to select enough fraction of honest nodes is a key issue that needs to be addressed.
   In this paper, we propose a fair selection protocol for reconfiguring a committee in a permissionless blockchain. Our fair selection protocol consists of two main phases: the mining process and the confirmation of the new nodes list. We analyze the impact of the network latency and give a rigorous proof of the mining process. Furthermore, we point out that in the process of confirming the new nodes list, "node censorship" by a malicious leader could lead to an increase in the proportion of new nodes controlled by an adversary. We propose a threshold-vote rule to defend against the node censorship attack and prove the security of the entire protocol, including safety and liveness properties. Our fair selection protocol could be implemented in committee-based permissionless blockchains according to different demands with proper parameters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention for different types of stakeholders due to its stable implementation in the field of digital currency like Bitcoin. Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchain's non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution.

TI Blockchain-based approach to create a model of trust in open and

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION

AB Currently, the training of the future work force presents challenging problems to higher education. This training, in the form of practical and theoretical knowledge can come from multiple platforms, channels and means, both formal and informal. In addition, it is quite difficult to assess the knowledge skill level that a student has acquired to optimize their chances for future employability. This, together with the need to still manage academic curricula on paper, the problems of confidence when validating these documents and contrasting them with real knowledge, etc., means that management in higher education requires revolutionary new tools. This work evaluates the benefits of the blockchain (or distributed ledger) technology and advocates a decentralised model of confidence for transactions based on an academic crypto currency. In this approach blockchain is used to manage transactions of content, teaching and competencies, assessed by consensus by students, trainers and employers, to eliminate once and for all the "gap" between the academic world and the working world. This paper aims to address the current challenges of an increasingly dispersed, open and ubiquitous higher education. The proposed model can be implemented in any training institution to adapt its teaching to the specific needs of professional profiles validated by employers in the sector. This model has been validated by means of a prototype with more than acceptable results.

AB Voting is one of the fundamental pillars of modern democracy. Continuous efforts have been made to strengthen the processes and methods involved to achieve verifiable, transparent voting systems. In recent years, blockchain has been increasingly used to address multi-dimensional challenges across widespread application domains including healthcare, finance and e-voting. However, achieving an efficient solution via use of blockchain requires consideration of a range of factors such as block generation rate, transaction speed, and block size which have a profound role in determining the overall performance of the solution. Current research into this aspect of blockchain is focused on Bitcoin with the objective to achieve comparable performance as of existing online payment systems such as VISA. However, there exists a gap in literature with respect to investigating performance constraints for wider application domains. In this paper, we present our efforts to address this gap by presenting a detailed study into performance and scalability constraints for an e-voting system. Specifically, we conducted rigorous experimentation with permissioned and permissionless blockchain settings across different scenarios with respect to voting population, block size, block generation rate and transaction speed. The experiments highlighted interesting observations with respect to the impact of these parameters on the overall efficiency and scalability of the e-voting model including trade-offs between different parameters as well as security and performance.

AB As one of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain networks, consensus mechanism has attracted tremendous interests from both the academics and industries. Recently, more attention has been paid to the consensus mechanism with fair multi-miners participation. However, most of them are fixed miners based and one-by-one block creation, and thus offering opportunities for attackers to launch DoS attack against the fixed miners or manipulate the blocks creation by bribing the fixed miners. Additionally, one-by-one block creation may result in vast transactions waiting to be confirmed, especially in a large scale of blockchain network. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus mechanism called proof-of-negotiation (PoN). With negotiation rules, trust management is introduced to evaluate the trustworthiness of miners, and thus achieving the random-honest miners selection for a round of block creation. To further improve the efficiency of PoN in creating blocks, parallel multi-blocks creation can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously by dividing the miner team as k groups. Meanwhile, a distributed blocks storage scheme is designed with a map function to alleviate the storage volume caused by massive blocks creation. Simulation results show that PoN is more effective than traditional consensus mechanism in one-by-one block creation and more efficient in creating blocks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design.
   This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less "digital twins" for industrial IOT applications.

AB Smart contract technology is reshaping conventional industry and business processes. Being embedded in blockchains, smart contracts enable the contractual terms of an agreement to be enforced automatically without the intervention of a trusted third party. As a result, smart contracts can cut down administration and save services costs, improve the efficiency of business processes and reduce the risks. Although smart contracts are promising to drive the new wave of innovation in business processes, there are a number of challenges to be tackled. This paper presents a survey on smart contracts. We first introduce blockchains and smart contracts. We then present the challenges in smart contracts as well as recent technical advances. We also compare typical smart contract platforms and give a categorization of smart contract applications along with some representative examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing framework for multiple requesters with multiple workers built on Ethereum blockchain-SenseChain. Crowdsensing frameworks utilize workers' sensing capabilities to fulfill requesters' sensing tasks. While crowdsensing is typically managed by a centralized platform, the centralized management entails various challenges such as reliability in workers' selection, fair evaluation for payment distribution, potential breach of users' privacy, and high deployment cost. The proposed solution, SenseChain, is a decentralized crowdsensing framework developed to run on Ethereum blockchain to mitigate said challenges while increasing users' engagement, with reasonable cost. SenseChain is developed around three smart contracts: (1) User Manager Contract (UMC), (2) Task Manager Contract (TMC), and (3) Task Detailed Contract (TDC). These contracts implement the platform features such as maintaining users' information, publishing tasks from multiple requesters, accepting reservations and solutions from multiple workers, and evaluating solutions to calculate proportional payments. The framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The framework performance is compared to a centralized greedy selection framework to demonstrate its comparability while mitigating tackled challenges. The results in terms of solutions quality, time cost, and workers traveled distance confirm its viability as a solution for crowdsensing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Load balancing is a major research discipline in Cloud computing. The services are provided to users on pay as you go manner. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed for load balancing, but performance is still an issue. The authors have proposed a new hybrid algorithm H_FAC to optimize the performance in cloud computing. The hybrid technique combines cuckoo search along with the Firefly algorithm of swarm intelligence. The benefit of using hybridization technique is that strength of one algorithm will overcome the shortcomings of other algorithms. Blockchain ID based Signature technique is used to ensure the authenticity of cloud service provider. The experimental results of H_FAC minimize the standard deviation, execution time significantly and improved throughput thereby optimizing the performance. The hybrid algorithm is also compared with other algorithms like ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, round robin, FCFS and modified throttled. This approach helps the users to get the resources from authentic resource providers with a reduced execution time.

AB In this paper we survey a number of interesting applications of blockchain technology not related to cryptocurrencies. As a matter of fact, after an initial period of application to cryptocurrencies and to the financial world, blockchain technology has been successfully exploited in many other different scenarios, where its unique features allowed the definition of innovative and sometimes disruptive solutions. In particular, this paper takes into account the following application scenarios: end-to-end verifiable electronic voting, healthcare records management, identity management systems, access control systems, decentralized notary (with a focus on intellectual property protection) and supply chain management. For each of these, we firstly analyse the problem, the related requirements and the advantages the adoption of blockchain technology might bring. Then, we present a number of relevant solutions proposed in the literature both by academia and companies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID KEY MANAGEMENT SCHEME
AB The advances of artificial intelligence (AI) propels big data processing and transmission for Internet of Things (IoT), by capturing and structuring big data produced by heterogeneous devices. While applying blockchain to manage IoT devices and associated big data, the blockchain itself suffers from abuse of decentralization from anonymous users. Specifically, it has been utilized to facilitate black market trades and illegal activities. Ateniese et & x00A0;al. proposed using the chameleon hash (CH) to derive redactable blockchain (EuroS&P), which works by embedding a trapdoor in the basic hash function so that block content can be rewritten without causing major hard forks. In short, the redacted block hash remains unchanged. However, there is lacking intelligent design where any mistakes observed in the chain can be corrected universally and automatically. This creates disincentives to use redactable blockchain (RB) for managing big data or any data-driven business mainly due to ineffective chain redaction. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose the notion of the self-redactable blockchain (SRB) to support intelligent execution of chain redaction. Specifically, we propose the first revocable chameleon hash (RCH) to power RB. It enables an ephemeral trapdoor for finding collision without any co-operation. Periodical expiration is applied to committed hash and an ephemeral trapdoor to prevent any abuses of redaction power. We instantiate how to use our RCH to build SRB as an intelligent trust-layer for IoT. We also give a rigorous analysis as well as comprehensive experiments to validate our proposals. The evidence showed that our proposal is secure and acceptably efficient for IoT devices.

TI Private Key Recovery on Bitcoin with Duplicated Signatures

AB In the modern financial sector, interest in providing financial services that employ blockchain technology has increased. Blockchain technology is efficient and can operate without a trusted party to store all transaction information; additionally, it provides transparency and prevents the tampering of transaction information. However, new security threats can occur because blockchain technology shares all the transaction information. Furthermore, studies have reported that the private keys of users who use the same signature value two or more times can be recovered. Because private keys of blockchain identify users, private key leaks can result in attackers stealing the ownership rights to users' property. Therefore, as more financial services use blockchain technology, actions to counteract the threat of private key recovery must be continually investigated. Private key recovery studies are presented here. Based on these studies, duplicated signatures generated by blockchain users are defined. Additionally, scenarios that generate and use duplicated signatures are applied in an actual bitcoin environment to demonstrate that actual bitcoin users' private keys can be recovered.

AB Digitalization and digital health are transforming research practices, while economic growth is increasingly driven by the information commons. In the case of biological sciences, information commons, such as public biobanks and free/libre open source software (FLOSS), are of paramount importance for both research and the bioeconomy. In a time of digitalization, however, information commons are vulnerable to violations, such as the free-rider problem, that render the commons unsustainable. Consequently, it has been argued that the enclosure of the informational common resources is the only means to effectively exploit them. Given the social and economic importance of the information commons, the new digital environment in biology and health requires governance innovation that will regulate the social embedding of the commons and their relationship to the free market, that is, a new political economy is needed. In this context, the need for a core common infrastructure, stretching from the physical to the logical and content layer of the information environment, that will guarantee the protection of the commons from both violations and enclosures, has been highlighted. Focusing on the interaction between two biological/bioinformatics commons, namely public biobanks and the FLOSS, we have set up an ecosystem relying on a blockchain technology. The proposed governance mechanism protects the information commons from the free-rider problem and guarantees their sustainability without hampering their operational framework. Our model demonstrates the interdependence and protection of the information commons not as an abstract theoretical exercise, but rather as a physical reality on the digital ontological matrix.

AB In this paper, a cascaded depth learning framework is constructed. A cascaded depth model is successfully implemented by studying and analyzing the specific feature transformation, feature selection, and classifier algorithm used in the framework. A feature combination method based on enhanced feature selection and classification is proposed according to the different features learned by each layer of the model. Combining block chain cryptography technology, distributed technology, consensus accounting mechanism of technology innovation, transaction data encapsulation into specific format data unit, encapsulated into a linear list in chronological order, using encryption algorithm trading transparency, traceability of data, security, credibility, and uniqueness in financial data analysis. The experimental results show that with the increase of the number of model layers, our method can significantly improve the classification accuracy. This result also verifies that the proposed model can learn more effective data representation features and also verifies the effectiveness of the proposed feature combination method.

AB Difficulties in financing and low utilization of funds are main financial problems that plague the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. The key to solving this problem lies in opening up the social data circulation between enterprises. It is a good solution for enterprises with frequent data interactions to form groups. Using group loans, the borrowing enterprises could solve the funding difficulties and the loan enterprises could improve the utilization rate of funds. In this article, we construct a group loan system based on blockchain technology, which can promote the free flow of funds among enterprises in the group. We combine the blockchain with the trusted execution environment to realize the automatic determination of loan conditions and realize the automatic execution of smart contracts. We also use the linkable group signature technology to ensure the traceability of loan users while protecting the anonymity. In addition, we use homomorphic encryption technology to make the statement confidential and computable.

AB Blockchain expansion is the high priority necessity to improve security. Hacking and other attacks are headway from system innovation and security measures for the cloud architecture. That is why the countermeasure deployed for such attacks should act in an opportune way and ought to be situated as close as possible to attacking device. As an example, DDoS attacks were not that complex as they are getting now with the new technology known as IoT. Imagine the consequences if 25 billion of IoT devices generate a huge amount of data for DDoS attacks. That is why we propose a new framework that can expand blockchain in a manner where more companies can share their resources to enhance security. So, we proposed a new and complete framework with cloud, fog, to secure configuration files with blockchain technology. Our framework considers the configuration files from SDN or NFV as an asset to secure with blockchain. By saving configuration files into blockchain, we can detect illegal changes occurred to configuration files after hacking attack. This study also focuses on expanding blockchain between the multiple service providers with ease to prevent waste of resources. This paper mainly provides opportunities for different could or companies to secure their assets by employing the power of blockchain and smart contracts.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to strive to close the current research gap pertaining to potential implications of the blockchain (BC) for sustainable business models (SBMs) in the agri-food industry. Design/methodology/approach To answer the research question, the authors utilised the Value Triangle framework by Biloslavo et al. (2018) in order to explore the potential innovation of BC for SBMs in the agri-food industry. Then, the authors apply it to an in-depth exploratory case study of the Placido Volpone winery. The authors draw data from strategic plans, annual reports, corporate website and a semi-structured interview with the winery's founder. Findings The authors show how BC technology could be a source of SBM innovation in the agri-food industry.
   Originality/value The paper is novel because it investigates the relationship between SBM innovation and BC providing theoretical justification to SBM technological innovation in an agri-food setting. Additionally, the paper provides an empirical application of the framework by Biloslavo et al. (2018) for understanding the development of SBM through BC in the agri-food industry.

AB Certificateless authenticated key agreement (CLAKA) is important to prevent the escrow problem. It also mitigates the certificate management burden in storage and during the message exchange. However, many previously designed CLAKA protocols were designed in the centralized system architectures that may cause the single point of failure. A new CLAKA is designed in a decentralized (blockchain) architecture that is very suitable for wireless body area networks (WBANs). The proposed protocol is secure as long as it computes a common session key between WBAN user and blockchain nodes. An ID-based blind signature with message recovery is used between blockchain nodes. The blind signature with message recovery is used to achieve authentication and anonymity by acquiring a signature without disclosing the message. It also has advantage in minimizing the size of signature and it is efficient in a situation of limited bandwidth. The protocol analysis shows that it is secure and can resist many WBAN security attacks compared to the existing authenticated key agreement protocols.

AB Despite the anticipated benefits and the numerous announcements of pilot cases, we have seen very few successful implementations of blockchain technology (BCT) solutions in supply chains. Little is empirically known about the obstacles to blockchain adoption, particularly in a supply chain's interorganizational setting. In supply chains, blockchains' benefits, for example, BCT-based tracking and tracing, are dependent on a critical mass of supply chain actors adopting the technology. While previous research has mainly been conceptual and has lacked both theory and empirical data, we propose a theory-based model for interorganizational adoption of BCT. We use the proposed model to analyze a unique in-depth revelatory case study. Our case study confirms previous conceptual work and reveals a paradox as well as several tensions between drivers for and against (positive and negative determining factors, respectively) of BCT adoption that must be managed in an interorganizational setting. In this vertical context, the adoption and integration decision of one supply chain actor recursively affects the adoption and integration decisions of the other supply chain actors. This paper contributes midrange theory on BCT in supply chain management (SCM), future research directions, and managerial insights on BCT adoption in supply chains.

AB Automation is a direct result of digitalisation of different aspects of our lives. Where various functions have been automated, some are still being carried out manually. One such function is the verification of academic records which is still being done predominantly in manual fashion. Blockchain technology provides a solution for storing immutable records in distributed ledgers that can be verified anytime. This paper presents an architecture for digital verification of academic records using blockchain technology. The paper also presents an implementation of this architecture as a proof of concept.

AB The insurance industry plays a key role in any modern economy. Blockchain technology promises to completely revolutionise the industry, with several bold claims made in terms of facilitating and speeding up claims settlements and improving fraud management. In this paper, we examine the factors that may influence the extent of blockchain proliferation and penetration within the insurance industry. We adopt the STEEP framework to analyse the key social, technological, environmental, economic and political/legal issues that may impact the insurance industry's openness or otherwise to blockchain, drawing on a diverse, multi-disciplinary literature. We supplement this with data drawn from 565 European respondents to a survey on blockchain use within the insurance industry. The results emphasise the need for the industry to properly understand and communicate how blockchain can be implemented across different insurance tasks in order to obtain a more tangible view of its benefits for staff, management and customers alike.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blockchain technology on firms' operational efficiency in the context of China.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors use panel data for blockchain-based companies listed on stock exchanges in China (Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong) between 2014 and 2018. The operational efficiency of firms that deploy blockchain technology is evaluated using ordinary least squares and system generalized method of moments estimation.
   Findings
   Results suggest that companies' current year performance exceeds the previous year performance because of blockchain deployment in firms' operations. Firms with higher financial leverage and return on assets reap more benefits from blockchain. Larger and older firms benefit less from blockchain implementation. Stochastic frontier estimation suggests that, on average, firms attain a 57.76 per cent technical efficiency level, or, put differently, they operate 42.24 per cent below their maximum level of potential output.
   Originality/value
   Blockchain can benefit firms in terms of consensus, security and trust, spurring the evolution of a new form of organizational dynamics. This study explores the theory of transactional cost analysis under blockchain technology. In addition, this study hypothesizes and empirically demonstrates the significant impacts of blockchain technology on corporations' operational efficiency, using audited, externally reported financial data. Industry professionals can reap benefits from this research by noticing the magnitude of changes in firms' financial parameters attributable to blockchain adoption.

AB Background: Efficiently sharing health data produced during standard care could dramatically accelerate progress in cancer treatments, but various barriers make this difficult. Not sharing these data to ensure patient privacy is at the cost of little to no learning from real-world data produced during cancer care. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated a willingness of patients with cancer to share their treatment experiences to fuel research, despite potential risks to privacy.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to design, pilot, and release a decentralized, scalable, efficient, economical, and secure strategy for the dissemination of deidentified clinical and genomic data with a focus on late-stage cancer.
   Methods: We created and piloted a blockchain-authenticated system to enable secure sharing of deidentified patient data derived from standard of care imaging, genomic testing, and electronic health records (EHRs), called the Cancer Gene Trust (CGT). We prospectively consented and collected data for a pilot cohort (N=18), which we uploaded to the CGT. EHR data were extracted from both a hospital cancer registry and a common data model (CDM) format to identify optimal data extraction and dissemination practices. Specifically, we scored and compared the level of completeness between two EHR data extraction formats against the gold standard source documentation for patients with available data (n=17).
   Results: Although the total completeness scores were greater for the registry reports than those for the CDM, this difference was not statistically significant. We did find that some specific data fields, such as histology site, were better captured using the registry reports, which can be used to improve the continually adapting CDM. In terms of the overall pilot study, we found that CGT enables rapid integration of real-world data of patients with cancer in a more clinically useful time frame. We also developed an open-source Web application to allow users to seamlessly search, browse, explore, and download CGT data.
   Conclusions: Our pilot demonstrates the willingness of patients with cancer to participate in data sharing and how blockchain-enabled structures can maintain relationships between individual data elements while preserving patient privacy, empowering findings by third-party researchers and clinicians. We demonstrate the feasibility of CGT as a framework to share health data trapped in silos to further cancer research. Further studies to optimize data representation, stream, and integrity are required.

AB The accuracy and performance of deep neural network models become important issues as the applications of deep learning increase. For example, the navigation system of autonomous self-driving vehicles requires very accurate deep learning models. If a self-driving car fails to detect a pedestrian in bad weather, the result can be devastating. If we can increase the model accuracy by increasing the training data, the probability of avoiding such scenarios increases significantly. However, the problem of privacy for consumers and lack of enthusiasm for sharing their personal data, e.g., the recordings of their self-driving car, is an obstacle for using this valuable data. In Blockchain technology, many entities which cannot trust each other in normal conditions can join together to achieve a mutual goal. In this paper, a secure decentralized peer-to-peer framework for training the deep neural network models based on the distributed ledger technology in Blockchain ecosystem is proposed. The proposed framework anonymizes the identity of data providers and therefore can be used as an incentive for consumers to share their private data for training deep learning models. The proposed framework uses the Stellar Blockchain infrastructure for secure decentralized training of the deep models. A deep learning coin is proposed for Blockchain compensation.

AB Ethereum is a public, open-source, decentralized, and peer-to-peer blockchain-based computing network which is involving to the usefulness of smart contract. It gives a distributed Turing-complete virtual machine in which some codes can be executed by utilizing a worldwide and public network of nodes. The compelled certificate creation and Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks are two major attacks on End-to-End Encryption (EEE) and SSL/TLS. A portion of the real attacks on end-to-end encryption and SSL/TLS is IP/ARP poisoning and the phishing attack. MITM attack makes the client difficult to understand, whether they are associated with a unique verified and secured connection or not. Since the certificate and public-key that is being passed during the connection setup is unreliable and insecure, the attacker can undoubtedly change the data in the certificate and leaves the endorsement of the certificate and public-key to the client. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution of providing the legitimacy and authenticity of freely shared and published online digital data, e.g., digital certificates, cryptographic keys, and common reference strings such as shared passwords using a mix of recently developed innovations which primary include blockchain, smart contract, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and quantum-resistant Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol over rings and ideal lattices. Ethereum smart contract is utilized to manage, surveil, and give detectability and visibility into the history of digital data from its beginning to the most recent variant, in a way that it is decentralized and internationally accessed with high integrity, resiliency, and transparency, that we should thank to the immutability and irreversibility of the blockchain. The full code of our smart contract is given, with a discourse on the execution and testing of its key functionalities.

AB This study is the first to provide systematic evidence regarding investor behaviour in initial coin offerings (ICOs), their investment patterns and their role in the success of campaigns. Using hand-collected data on 472 public token sales over the period of 2013-2017, we advance the ICO literature by demonstrating that some contributors often invest in more than one campaign, and such serial investors contribute earlier. However, they are not more informed and fail to pick better-quality ICOs. Only large serial investors invest more in campaigns that raise more funds, attract more contributors, are more likely to reach their hard caps, and distribute tokens that are listed on crypto exchange. Our findings raise the question of whether regulatory or industry self-regulation agreements on information provision measures are needed to protect smaller retail ICO investors that exhibit naive reinforcement learning behaviour.

TI Bitcoin's dynamic peer-to-peer topology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Topology discovery is a prerequisite when investigating the network properties; with the enormous number of Bitcoin users and performance issues, it becomes critical to analyse the network in a fashion that makes it possible to detect all Bitcoin's nodes and understand their behaviour. In massive, dynamic, and distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks like Bitcoin, where thousands of updates occur per second, it is hard to obtain an accurate topology representing the structure of the network as a graph with nodes and links by using the traditional local measurement approaches based on batches, offline data, or on the discovery of the topology around a small set of nodes and then combine them to discover an approximate network topology. All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system that performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links, which assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing. The topology discovery system allows us to gain knowledge on the Bitcoin network size, the network stability in terms of reachable, churn, and well-connected nodes, as well as some data regarding the effects of some countries' Internet infrastructure on Bitcoin traffic.

AB Due to the rapid development of information technology, supply chain network is evolving, which involves a higher level of interdependence between organisations. Conventional production capability evaluation relies on centralised approaches with limited sharing of performance and evaluation data. Besides, traditional evaluation methods are mainly based on subjective manual operation using limited data. In this paper, we propose a production capability evaluation system by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and blockchain technology for supply chain network. It contributes to achieving real-time data collection and automated enterprise production capability evaluation mechanism. Besides, blockchain technology is adopted to enable open and decentralised data storage and sharing, provide fair and automatic trading of data. The proposed system is evaluated through a simulation experiment. It demonstrated how to utilise the proposed system to choose suitable upstream enterprises. The successful development of the system could help to enhance production efficiency, reduce risk and provide a reasonable and more sustainable production management in supply chain network.

AB For the growth of an economy, the satisfactory and steady availability of energy supplies is necessary. A developing country (like Pakistan) encounters perpetual issues of power losses. This paper explores the challenges faced by the power economy in Pakistan. Furthermore, technologies to prevent power losses are studied and analyzed. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper proposes a power loss preventing solution by using Ethereum smart contracts. These contracts handle both sides of the power economy (the consumer and the grid) by ensuring the integrity and security of data. For the evaluation of our proposed solution, we implement the contracts and the results show that our solution is effective in reducing the line losses. The proposed solution is location independent and can be applied to economies facing similar issues.

AB Advances in blockchain technology have made a significant impact on a wide range of research areas due to the features such as transparency, decentralization and traceability. With the explosive growth of blockchain transactions, there has been a growing interest in improving the scalability of blockchain network. Sharding is one of the methods to solve this scalability problem by partitioning the network into several shards so that each shard can process the transactions in parallel. Ethereum places each transaction statically on a shard based on its account address without considering the complexity of the transaction or the load generated by the transaction. This causes the transaction utilization on each shard to be uneven, which makes the transaction throughput of the network decrease. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP) and proposes a heuristic algorithm called GARET. The GARET dynamically relocates the transaction load of each shard based on gas consumption to maximize the transaction throughput. Ethereum gas is a unit that represents the amount of computational effort needed to execute operations in a transaction. Benchmarking results show that GARET outperforms existing techniques by up to 12% in transaction throughput and decreases the makespan of transaction latency by about 74% under various conditions. It is also shown that the relocation overhead is minimal and does not affect the overall performance.

AB Cryptocurrencies and the underpinning blockchain technology have gained unprecedented public attention recently. In contrast to fiat currencies, transactions of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, are permanently recorded on distributed ledgers to be seen by the public. As a result, public availability of all cryptocurrency transactions allows us to create a complex network of financial interactions that can be used to study not only the blockchain graph, but also the relationship between various blockchain network features and cryptocurrency risk investment. We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or blockchain motifs, to utilize this information. Chainlets allow us to evaluate the role of local topological structure of the blockchain on the joint Bitcoin and Litecoin price formation and dynamics. We investigate the predictive Granger causality of chainlets and identify certain types of chainlets that exhibit the highest predictive influence on cryptocurrency price and investment risk. More generally, while statistical aspects of blockchain data analytics remain virtually unexplored, the paper aims to highlight various emerging theoretical, methodological and applied research challenges of blockchain data analysis that will be of interest to the broad statistical community.

AB Chaotic image encryption has been greatly investigated in recent years. However, a considerable number of the encryption schemes had been cracked by chosen plaintext attack (CPA). Although the new proposed plaintext-related chaotic image encryption schemes can resist CPA effectively, the emerged key management problem is a hot potato. In this paper, a novel fingerprint-related chaotic image encryption scheme is proposed. The generation of key streams is affected by the fingerprints of distributors rather than the plaintexts of images. In addition, the blockchain framework is adopted to ensure that the encrypted image was sent correctly form the distributor. Moreover, the distributors' fingerprints embedded in the encrypted images are encoded by the anti-collusion code in order to record multiple fingerprints with fixed length of data. The proposed method has the following superiorities: 1) Security. CPA is invalid because the attacker does not have the fingerprint of the legal receiver. Meanwhile, no key management problem is caused. 2) Authenticity. The image, the sender and the receiver are all verified by using blockchain framework. 3) Traceability. All distributors' fingerprints can be extracted correctly from the merged fingerprint based on the anti-collusion code, and the transmission of the image can be traced.

AB With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the proliferation of sensor technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is now being widely used in smart home for the purposes of efficient resource management and pervasive sensing. In smart homes, various IoT devices are connected to each other, and these connections are centered on gateways. The role of gateways in the smart homes is significant, however, its centralized structure presents multiple security vulnerabilities such as integrity, certification, and availability. To address these security vulnerabilities, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based smart home gateway network that counters possible attacks on the gateway of smart homes. The network consists of three layers including device, gateway, and cloud layers. The blockchain technology is employed at the gateway layer wherein data is stored and exchanged in the form blocks of blockchain to support decentralization and overcome the problem from traditional centralized architecture. The blockchain ensures the integrity of the data inside and outside of the smart home and provides availability through authentication and efficient communication between network members. We implemented the proposed network on the Ethereum blockchain technology and evaluated in terms of standard security measures including security response time and accuracy. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed security solutions outperforms over the existing solutions.

AB Injectable hydrogels have attracted great research interest for the delivery drugs and recruitment of cells to promote tissue regeneration. In this work, a series of the amino acid based methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-(poly (gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate-co/b-L-phenylalanine) block copolymers (mPEG-b-P (ELG-co/b-Phe)s) with similar block chain length, but different proportion and sequence of gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (ELG) and L-phenylalanine (Phe) arrangements were prepared through ring-opening polymerization method. The influence of the ratio and sequence structures of mPEG-b-P (ELG-co/b-Phe)s on their thermosensitive aqueous gelation behaviors were investigated in detail. The results showed that the obtained polymers showned higher modulus (G') and lower critical gelation temperature with higher proportion of L-phenylalanine. However, the physical properties start to deteriorate as the copolymers have a large number of phenylalanine groups. To clarify this phenomenon, the analysis of secondary structure with circular dichroism (CD) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum showed that random coil reached a higher percentage as incorporated phenylalanine groups increased. On the other hand, the polymers with different sequence and similar compositions exhibited divergence due to the influence of random coil conformation. In addition, the good biocompatibility of mPEG-b-P (ELG-co-Phe)s were observed in vitro and in vivo. The copolymers have the potential to be used as thermo-sensitive injectable hydrogels for biomedical applications.

AB Precision agriculture is based on the idea of utilizing technology to improve the efficiency of agriculture industry. Blockchain technology has great potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry. Furthermore, various Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are proposed to enhance production such as crops condition monitoring system. These technologies aim to address various stages of the agricultural supply chain by improving the processes. The key issue faced by farmers is to ensure the protection of their crops from animals during all stages of a harvest. This paper proposes a IoT-based prevention system to tackle this issue for safe farming. The solution is based on the input of the sensor nodes deployed in the field to detect animal attacks. These sensors report a hazard to a Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) in the field. The RNS produces human-safe ultrasonic sound waves that are unbearable for animals, thus they leave the field. The proposed RNS system also reports all hazard incidents to a centralized Farm Management System (FMS) maintained by the farmer. The paper also proposes a way the FMS can add value to a broader arena by becoming a service to an Agricultural Blockchain system. As a blockchain node, the FMS maintains a shared ledger as part of blockchain to share the details of incidents with meta information with other nodes in the blockchain. This information is vital for other blockchain nodes of the agricultural blockchain such as other FMS, companies, authorities and standard bodies. The low-cost RNS performance evaluation concludes that it is power efficient that makes it even affordable for developing countries, and as a Blockchain service it enables novel applications for the agriculture industry.

AB Geoenergy sources will continue to be mainstays of the world's energy mix for many years to come, but the technological and business realities behind these energy sources are changing in two fundamental ways. First, with much of the world's "easy oil" already consumed, the companies behind geoenergy will have to use increasingly sophisticated technologies to find and deliver these energy sources to the market. Second, the expectations placed upon the geoenergy sector by many of its stakeholders have grown considerably with regards to environmental stewardship, safety, and human welfare. In the face of these kinds of challenges, the industry will require an increasing degree of technological and commercial sophistication to continue to be a part of the world's sustainable energy mix. Blockchain has emerged as a promising innovation that could potentially play an important role in delivering the kinds of technological and commercial capabilities that the geoenergy sector will need to achieve these ends. In spite of the myriad ways that blockchain could potentially improve the efficiency and sustainability of the geoenergy industry, however, the technology is still evolving, and a few barriers stand in the way of its widespread deployment. This paper puts forward case study evidence from the Intel Corporation and the Energistics Consortium showing what the geoenergy sector can learn about blockchain from other industries, and highlights that the absence of data standards and interoperability has contributed to blockchain's failure to deliver significant value in the geoenergy domain thus far.

TI FSFC: An input filter-based secure framework for smart contract

AB Discovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly those that can be exploited, is challenging. Existing research efforts tend to focus on pre-tests or are not capable of dynamically protecting the deployed contracts without impacting on the availability of the contracts. Thus in this paper, we propose and implement a high-availability and unified input Filter-based Secure Framework for Ethereum smart Contract (hereafter referred to as FSFC). FSFC is designed to allow the deployed smart contracts to continue running normally even when faced with potential attacks (due to vulnerability exploitation). Specifically, the proposed approach allows one to dynamically identify and discard bad inputs before getting processed. In other words, the owner can protect the contract by deploying filters through FSFC, regardless of the vulnerability discovered in the deployed contract, and without suspending the contract service. We also evaluate the security of FSFC. Then, using integer vulnerability as a case study, we demonstrate how FSFC can be deployed and evaluate its utility using real-world smart contracts with known integer vulnerability. For example, a comparative summary demonstrates that in comparison to the plain Geth, FSFC only incurs minimal additional overhead for the miners and less than 2% extra gas consumption for normal users.

AB Multi-sided platforms are omnipresent in today's digital world. However, establishing a platform includes challenges: The platform utility usually increases with the number of participants. At an early stage, potential participants expect the platform utility to be low and lack an incentive to join (i.e., "chicken and egg" problem). Blockchain-enabled utility tokens hold the promise to overcome this problem. They supposedly provide a suitable financial incentive for their owners to join the platform as soon as possible. In the first half of 2018, investors seemed to believe in the presumption and spent more than US$ 17.6 billion in token sales. To date, we know little about this financial incentive in the context of the token economy. For this purpose, we model the token value development and the associated incentives in a multi-sided blockchain-enabled platform. The resulting findings suggest that blockchain-enabled utility tokens can help to overcome the "chicken and egg" problem. However, these tokens lead to contradictory incentives for platform participants, and can even inhibit platform usage. The contribution of our work is twofold: First, we develop one of the first models for token value development. Second, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the utility token's financial incentive.

TI Network Dynamics of a Financial Ecosystem

ID COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; DISTRIBUTIONS; TOPOLOGY
AB Global financial crises have led to the understanding that classical econometric models are limited in comprehending financial markets in extreme conditions, partially since they disregarded complex interactions within the system. Consequently, in recent years research efforts have been directed towards modeling the structure and dynamics of the underlying networks of financial ecosystems. However, difficulties in acquiring fine-grained empirical financial data, due to regulatory limitations, intellectual property and privacy control, still hinder the application of network analysis to financial markets. In this paper we study the trading of cryptocurrency tokens on top of the Ethereum Blockchain, which is the largest publicly available financial data source that has a granularity of individual trades and users, and which provides a rare opportunity to analyze and model financial behavior in an evolving market from its inception. This quickly developing economy is comprised of tens of thousands of different financial assets with an aggregated valuation of more than 500 Billion USD and typical daily volume of 30 Billion USD, and manifests highly volatile dynamics when viewed using classic market measures. However, by applying network theory methods we demonstrate clear structural properties and converging dynamics, indicating that this ecosystem functions as a single coherent financial market. These results suggest that a better understanding of traditional markets could become possible through the analysis of fine-grained, abundant and publicly available data of cryptomarkets.

TI Blockchain-Based Privacy-Aware Pseudonym Management Framework for
   Vehicular Networks
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article; Early Access
DE Vehicular networks; Pseudonym; PKI; Blockchain; Privacy; Security
AB Vehicular networks rely on public key infrastructure (PKI) to generate the long-term and short-term (pseudonyms) certified pair of keys. This allows vehicles to use these keys to sign and to encrypt their exchanged messages in order to authenticate the sender and to ensure the integrity of messages. Therefore, the use of pseudonyms is fundamental to safeguard the security, to satisfy the non-repudiation and to revoke misbehaving nodes. However, the current PKI infrastructure is centralized making it vulnerable and at risk of being single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based pseudonym management framework for vehicular networks that ensures the security and privacy while maintaining the functionality of the network. The security of the proposed solution was evaluated using attack tree method, and the results have shown an improved resiliency to attacks than the conventional vehicular PKI.

AB Purpose
   Financial technology innovation within the developed world is driving financial markets, yet its adoption is lagging among consumers in emerging markets. At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used.
   Findings
   The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory.
   Originality/value
   The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour.

AB In this article, we introduce a blockchain governance framework that defines the governance of a blockchain as a combination of six dimensions and three layers. An evaluation through eight expert interviews confirms the perceived usefulness and operational feasibility of the presented framework. Furthermore, the framework, is demonstrated by an application in two case studies. The introduced blockchain governance framework establishes a shared understanding and discussion surrounding the topic of blockchain governance.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to discuss the possibility of setting up a platform for inclusive policymaking process drawing upon the blockchain concept. The study posits that blockchain also has great potentials in non-financial applications, such as in policymaking, where there is a need for bottom-up approaches with more decentralized, distributed and evidence-based processes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study makes use of an analogy-based creative design methodology. The design science paradigm has its roots in engineering and the sciences of the artificial (Simon, 1996). As a problem-solving paradigm for solving complex engineering issues, design science seeks to create innovations that define the ideas, practices, technical capabilities and products through which the analysis, design, implementation and use of information systems can be effectively and efficiently accomplished. In the present study, the policy development theories and the logic of blockchain are synthesized to prepare a task model for the "IdeaChain" concept as a platform for creating, sharing and validating novel ideas as well as converting them into policies or new ventures through the funding mechanisms.
   Findings
   The IdeaChain concept is designed and demonstrated through its use in the domain of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy, which can be extended to cover all innovative activities linking the whole process from their emergence, funding, development, implementation and impact upon policy.
   Originality/value
   Blockchain is mostly discussed in literature with its impact on financial sector. IdeaChain is the first attempt to explore the potentials of blockchain in STI policymaking.

AB Purpose This paper aims at investigating the possibility of effectively implementing the blockchain technology in the real estate environment, specifically applied to the Trust legal instrument in Dopo di Noi (After Us) project, which is intended to guarantee assistance to persons with severe disabilities. Design/methodology/approach The paper is focused on how to apply the blockchain to the tool of Trust, analyzing the main features and characteristics of this technology. Findings The paper proposes two potential solutions for managing the Trust tool in the real estate sector, specifically within the Dopo di Noi project. The first simpler proposal is based on timestamping application. The second one radically changes the classical Trust model and introduces an automatization level in the process. Originality/value This paper highlights the potentiality of the combination of the blockchain technology and the real estate environment and applies the blockchain technology to the Dopo di Noi project. Specifically, with the second solution, the paper proposes a platform that gathers, in a single network, various elements of the blockchain technology, such as timestamping, smart property, smart contract, and links them in order to provide services to persons with severe disabilities.

AB Blockchain, as one of the most promising technology, has attracted tremendous attention. The interesting characteristics of blockchain are decentralized ledger and strong security, while non-repudiation is the important property of information security in blockchain. A digital signature scheme is an effective approach to achieve non-repudiation. In this paper, the characteristics of blockchain and the digital signature to guarantee information non-repudiation are firstly discussed. Secondly, the typical digital signature schemes in blockchain are classified and analyzed, and then the state-of-the-art digital signatures are investigated and compared in terms of application fields, methods, security, and performance. Lastly, the conclusions are given, and some future works are suggested to stir research efforts in this field. Our works will facilitate to design efficient and secure digital signature algorithms in blockchain.

TI A new model for intra- and inter-institutional soil data sharing
SO SOIL
LA English
DT Article
AB Data sharing and collaboration are critical to solving large-scale problems. The prevailing soil data-sharing model is based on different groups sending their data to a lead party. This model is of a centralised nature and, consequently, results in the participants ceding control and governance over their data to the lead party. Here we explore the use of a distributed ledger (blockchain) to solve the aforementioned issues. We explain what a blockchain is and some of its characteristics to then describe some features of a blockchain that make it an interesting candidate for an inter-institutional database. Finally, we describe the potential use case of developing a global soil spectral library with multiple, independent international institutions constituting the network.

AB Mobile crowd sourcing offers a way for an organization to gain afar their "base of minds" of workforce offers in the form of idea competitions or innovation contests where task is divided among individuals to achieve a pooled result using mobile devices. However, mobile crowd sourcing consequence to an urban bias in addition to other key challenging issues such as safety, privacy and connectivity or data fault tolerance. Fault tolerance in mobile crowd sourcing is a property to tolerate any fault related to data collected or the working of the system. Further, it is needed to ensure a secure resilient mechanism due to de-centralized behavior of the network. In this paper, we have proposed a resilient-improved two-stage auction (ITA) and blockchain mechanism in mobile crowd sourcing beneficial for the organizations. The resilient technique and secure scheme is beneficial for the organizations that select the workers according to their budget and time. Further, an akka API tool is implemented upon already existing mobile crowd sourcing technique i.e. ITA. The proposed resilient mechanism is initially implemented over. The proposed resilient ITA mechanism is analyzed over further crowd sourcing mechanisms needed for workers selection in order to benefit the organizations. Further, the resilient-ITA is measured against database connection loss that is considered as a promising type of fault occurring during the workers selection.

   fog computing (VFC)
ID MOBILE; MANAGEMENT
AB Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has been envisioned as an important application of fog computing in vehicular networks. Parked vehicles with embedded computation resources could be exploited as a supplement for VFC. They cooperate with fog servers to process offloading requests at the vehicular network edge, leading to a new paradigm called parked vehicle assisted fog computing (PVFC). However, each coin has two sides. There is a follow-up challenging issue in the distributed and trustless computing environment. The centralized computation offloading without tamper-proof audit causes security threats. It could not guard against false-reporting, free-riding behaviors, spoofing attacks and repudiation attacks. Thus, we leverage the blockchain technology to achieve decentralized PVFC. Request posting, workload undertaking, task evaluation and reward assignment are organized and validated automatically through smart contract executions. Network activities in computation offloading become transparent, verifiable and traceable to eliminate security risks. To this end, we introduce network entities and design interactive smart contract operations across them. The optimal smart contract design problem is formulated and solved within the Stackelberg game framework to minimize the total payments for users. Security analysis and extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate that our scheme has high security and efficiency guarantee.

AB The rise of ubiquitous deepfakes, misinformation, disinformation, and post-truth, often referred to as fake news, raises concerns over the role of the Internet and social media in modern democratic societies. Due to its rapid and widespread diffusion, digital deception has not only an individual or societal cost, but it can lead to significant economic losses or to risks to national security. Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance and traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable, and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure platform for storing and exchanging information. This overview aims to explore the potential of DLTs to combat digital deception, describing the most relevant applications and identifying their main open challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to strengthen the resilience against cyber-threats on today's online media.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB As one of the most interactive economic activities, tourism has improved significantly since the Internet allowed customers (travelers) to look for and create their trips without the need to go to a travel agency. Through the development of Internet marketing, tourists are able to receive information in real-time and view them on the screens of their devices (computers, laptops, mobile phones or tablets), and consequently they can create their own content and share it with others. Due to this development, we are witnessing a new phenomenon, so-called app capitalism, in which companies like Uber and Airbnb make money on services and goods they do not own and finding new business models in the tourism sector which enable customer-to-customer models. To be able to respond to these changes, the tourism industry needs to bring together knowledge, money, and technology for the purpose of creating new business models. The development of technology in all social spheres, including tourism, has provided a strong tool for consumers in terms of both acquiring and disclosing information to others. One of the rapidly growing technologies which is also one of the cutting-edge technologies entering tourism is blockchain. Blockchain technology captured worldwide attention in 2017 and its implementation has been revolutionizing various industries (e.g., retail, healthcare, tourism). The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of the tourism industry in terms of blockchain implementation. Blockchain technology provides significant benefits to the tourism industry since its implementation can help increase competitive advantage, improve customer satisfaction and enhance performance. In this paper, the authors present the current situation in the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Macedonia regarding the use of blockchain technology in the tourism industry. The main findings of this paper comprise the detection of key areas regarding why blockchain technology is not implemented in the tourist industry, and what processes should be handled. By presenting a case study of the implementation of blockchain technology in tourism, the authors analyze the potential of using blockchain technology in the tourism industry and discuss topics for further research.

TI What motivates the sharing of consumer-generated genomic information?
SO SAGE OPEN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Genomic medicine; direct-to-consumer genetic testing; privacy;
   motivation; data sharing
AB Genomic medicine is an emerging practice that followed the completion of the Human Genome Project and that considers genomic information about an individual in the provision of their clinical care. Large and start-up direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies like Ancestry, 23andMe, Luna DNA, and Nebula Genomics have capitalized on findings from the Human Genome Project by offering genetic health testing services to consumers without a clinical intermediary. Genomic medicine is thus further propelled by unprecedented supply and demand market forces driven by direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. As government entities like the National Human Genome Research Institute question how genomics can be implemented into routine medical practice to prevent disease and improve the health of all members of a diverse community, we believe that stakeholders must first examine how and scenarios in which stakeholders can become motivated to share or receive genomic information. In this commentary, we discuss consumers three scenarios: satisfying personal curiosity, providing a social good, and receiving a financial return. We examine these motivations based on recent events and current avenues through which have engaged or can engage in genomic data sharing via private, secure (e.g. centralized genomic databases and de-centralized platforms like blockchain) and public, unsecure platforms (e.g. open platforms that are publicly available online). By examining these scenarios, we can likely determine how various stakeholders, such as consumers, might prefer to extract value from genomic information and how privacy preferences among those stakeholders might vary depending on how they seek to use or share genomic information. From there, one can recommend best practices to promote transparency and uphold privacy standards and expectations among stakeholders engaged in genomic medicine.

AB Private parking spot sharing can help relieve the parking problem due to insufficient public parking facilities in big cities. Meanwhile, users who share parking spots can also benefit, either by getting a free parking spot or by obtaining a parking fee payment. However, when users are sharing their private parking spots, their privacy is inevitable to be disclosed. This could put these parking spots owners into some unnecessary inconveniences, such as identity theft. Existing private parking spot sharing schemes either do not consider privacy issues. Or, when privacy is taken into account, they assume the existence of a trusted third party. To address these issues, we propose a privacy-enhanced private parking spot sharing scheme without trusted third parties. Specifically, we use market design method to share parking spots. We achieve enhanced privacy with decentralized anonymous credentials and confidential anonymous payment with a variant Monero. Extensive analysis confirms the security and privacy protection of the proposed scheme. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has moderate computational costs and communication overhead.

AB As data traffic in terrestrial-satellite systems surges, the integration of power allocation for caching, computing, and communication (3C) has attracted much research attention. However, previous works on 3C power allocation in terrestrial-satellite systems mostly focus on maximizing the overall system throughput. In this paper, we aim to guarantee both throughput fairness and data security in terrestrial-satellite systems. Specifically, we first divide the system implementation into three steps, i.e., data accumulation, blockchain computing, and wireless transmission. Then, we model and analyze the delay and power consumption in each step by proposing several theorems and lemmas regarding 3C power allocation. Based on the theorems and lemmas, we further formulate the problem of 3C power allocation as a Nash bargaining game and construct an optimization model for the game. Last, we solve the optimization problem using dual decomposition and obtain the optimal period of the satellite serving the ground stations as well as the optimal 3C power allocation solution. The optimal solution can provide guidelines for parameter configuration in terrestrial-satellite systems. The performance of the proposed terrestrial-satellite architecture is verified by extensive simulations.

AB Fog computing is considered to be a key enabling technology for future networks. By broadening the cloud computing services to the network edge, fog computing can support various emerging applications such as IoT, big data, and blockchain with low latency and low bandwidth consumption cost. To achieve the full potential of fog computing, it is essential to design an incentive mechanism for fog computing service providers. Auction is a promising solution for the incentive mechanism design. However, it is challenging to design an optimal auction that maximizes the revenue for the providers while holding important properties: IR and IC. Therefore, this article introduces the design of an optimal auction based on deep learning for the resource allocation in fog computing. The proposed optimal auction is developed specifically to support blockchain applications. In particular, we first discuss resource management issues in fog computing. Second, we review economic and pricing models for resource management in fog computing. Third, we introduce fog computing and blockchain. Fourth, we present how to design the optimal auction by using deep learning for the fog resource allocation in the blockchain network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline scheme (i.e., the greedy algorithm) in terms of revenue, and IC and IR violations. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used as a useful tool for the optimal resource allocation in general fog networks.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB There have been dramatic increases in industrial investment and growing research interests in Internet of Things over the past few years. Driven by the application demand from Internet of everything in the future, the collaboration between traditional cloud and edge cloud is already on the way to provide better service to diverse users. However, due to the high marginal operation and maintenance costs, there remains a need for collaboration between traditional clouds. JointCloud computing is a new computing paradigm that supports collaboration within heterogeneous clouds, which is a complex problem that is difficult to manage using the traditional methodology of "top-down, decomposition, and reduction" in the benign construction of the JointCloud ecosystem. In this article, we first describe the inherent mechanism behind the constructional evolution of the JointCloud ecosystem, which details the inner workings of its elements and the general principals of how these various elements influence each other. We then propose a series of forward-looking, feasible operational methods to support the constructional evolution of the JointCloud ecosystem that incorporate efficient development methods, data-driven operations, AI-assisted decision making and so on. Finally, a case study of a cross-cloud migration deployment is used to illustrate the scientific basis of the systems inherent mechanism, as well as the efficacy of the supporting methods.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), mobile crowdsensing (MCS), i.e., outsourcing sensing tasks to mobile devices or vehicles, has been proposed to address the problem of data collection in the scenarios such as smart city. Despite its benefits for a wide range of applications, MCS lacks an efficient incentive mechanism, restricting the development of IoT applications, especially for Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-a typical example of IoT applications; this is because vehicles are usually reluctant to participate these sensing tasks. Moreover, in practice, some sensing tasks may arrive suddenly (called an emergent task) in the IoV environment, but the resources of a single vehicle may be insufficient to handle, and thus multivehicles collaboration is required. In this case, the incentive mechanisms for the participation of multiple vehicles and the task scheduling for their collaborations are collectively needed. To address this important problem, we first propose a new model for the scenario of two vehicles collaboration, considering the situation of the emergent appearance of a task. In this model, for a general sensing task, we propose a bidding mechanism to better encourage vehicles to contribute their resources, and the tasks for those vehicles are scheduled accordingly. Second, for an emergent task, a novel time-window-based method is devised to manage the tasks among vehicles and to incent the vehicles to participate. Finally, we develop a blockchain framework to achieve the secured information exchange through smart contract for the proposed models in IoV.

AB In this article, we propose an energy-efficiency-aware integrated architecture of cooperative computing (CC) to support the demands of computing amount in the blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, we assume that multiple computing servers are placed at each data access point (DAP). The computing servers across multiple DAPs can be virtualized to constitute a CC pool to flexibly allocate the computing resource. When the amount of received data from a DAP is accumulated to a certain length of one data block, blockchain computing will be implemented to generate a correct Nonce value meeting the threshold of hash value. After the correct Nonce has been generated, the data block will be transmitted and stored in cloud caches, where the hash value is written into blockchain to guarantee the security of data block. We maximize system energy efficiency defined by the overall power consumption per unit of throughput transmitted from DAPs to cloud caches. We formulate the system optimization model by considering the constraints of data delay to avoid data overflow in the system. In order to solve the optimization model for maximizing system energy efficiency, we employ a geometric programming method to obtain the optimal power and resource allocation in blockchain-based IoT. By extensive simulations, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed energy-efficiency-aware optimization mechanism in the blockchain-based IoT.

TI Toward Secure Data Sharing for the IoV: A Quality-Driven Incentive

AB Currently, data sharing for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications has drawn much attention in the framework of developing smart cities and smart transportation. A critical challenge for data sharing is to incentivize users to participate in collecting and sharing data. The traditional incentive mechanism of crowdsourcing is not practical for IoV because of its trust issues. Although blockchain technology has been introduced to address trust issues and security challenges, ensuring trust in off-chain data for the blockchain-based approaches is still an open issue. In this article, we propose a quality-driven auction-based incentive mechanism based on a consortium blockchain that guarantees trust in both on-chain data and off-chain data. We first introduce a consortium blockchain that is used as an open and distributed hyperledger to address the security issue of on-chain data. Then, we formulate the problem as a reverse auction in which the platform acts as an auctioneer that purchases data from users. By utilizing a data quality-driven auction model, the evaluated data quality via expectation maximization is used to ensure the trust in off-chain data. The quality-driven, auction-based incentive mechanism can obtain the high-quality data and optimal social welfare with low social cost. Otherwise, we design a smart contract to perform the data sharing automatically. Finally, the extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm achieves maximum social welfare, outperforms other solutions, and scales well when the number of users or tasks increase. Moreover, the performance of the smart contract shows its low computing cost.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is gradually becoming mature and has already entered our daily life, which interconnects more machines and makes communication more convenient and more intelligent. Massive IoT devices produce innumerable data which need to be analyzed in joint cloud computation (JointCloud) with diversified services. However, due to the weak security of IoT devices, the existing JointCloud architecture hardly provides a secure trusted trade environment for users, which affects severely the application in the IoT network. In this article, we propose a hierarchical trust networking architecture based on permissioned blockchain to implement JointCloud (HTJC). The proposed Hyperledger fabric-based architecture has a better performance than those based on Ethereum in latency. By introducing the credit bonus-penalty strategy (CBPS), HTJC can solve the trust problem and provide users with a secure trusted trade environment. The availability of the proposed architecture is evaluated and compared to the existing models. The numerical results show that the HTJC can defend distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and provide users with a trusted and effective trade platform.

AB In this article, we study the pricing and resource management in the Internet of Things (IoT) system with blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and mobile-edge computing (MEC). The BaaS model includes the cloud-based server to perform blockchain tasks and the set of peers to collect data from local IoT devices. The MEC model consists of the set of terrestrial and aerial base stations (BSs), i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to forward the tasks of peers to the BaaS server. Each BS is also equipped with an MEC server to run some blockchain tasks. As the BSs can be privately owned or controlled by different operators, there is no information exchange among them. We show that the resource management and pricing in the BaaS-MEC system are modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game with multiple leaders and incomplete information about actions of leaders/BSs and followers/peers. We formulate a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the decision makings of BSs and peers. We also develop an unsupervised hierarchical deep learning (HDL) algorithm that combines deep $Q$ -learning (DQL) for BSs with the Bayesian deep learning (BDL) for peers. We prove that the proposed algorithms converge to stable states in which the peers' actions are the best responses to optimal actions of BSs.

AB Edge computing is a promising approach for provisioning distributed cloud services to Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Many recent studies propose that edge nodes use blockchain for the decentralized management and access control of IoT data. However, due to the massive volume of data and related transactions, edge servers will eventually run out of space to store the full chain. We introduce scalable and lightweight architecture called LiTiChain, a blockchain of blocks with finite lifetime. In LiTiChain, outdated transactions and blocks, that is, the blocks whose lifetimes are expired, can be safely removed from the chain. Two graphs are merged into the structure of LiTiChain: 1) a tree representing the order of expiry of lifetimes and 2) a linear graph representing the order of block creation. We show that this construction not only ensures the connectivity of the chain after block deletions but also helps to maintain the block height of shortened chain. LiTiChain also supports transactions whose lifetime is unknown at the time of creation. It is possible that some expired blocks need to be retained in the chain, in case they are needed to validate remaining blocks, which incurs additional storage costs. A detailed analysis of such overhead in storage costs is presented for stochastic and worst case scenarios. Extensive simulation is performed on actual and synthetic IoT data so as to gain insights on the storage costs under various lifetime distributions. It is demonstrated that LiTiChain provides a simple yet effective solution to scalability problems in storing blockchains for the IoT ecosystems.

AB Efficient and smart business processes are heavily dependent on the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where end-to-end optimization is critical to the success of the whole ecosystem. These systems, including industrial, healthcare, and others, are large scale complex networks of heterogeneous devices. This introduces many security and access control challenges. Blockchain has emerged as an effective solution for addressing several such challenges. However, the basic algorithms used in the business blockchain are not feasible for large scale IoT systems. To make them scalable for IoT, the complex consensus-based security has to be downgraded. In this article, we propose a novel lightweight proof of block and trade (PoBT) consensus algorithm for IoT blockchain and its integration framework. This solution allows the validation of trades as well as blocks with reduced computation time. Also, we present a ledger distribution mechanism to decrease the memory requirements of IoT nodes. The analysis and evaluation of security aspects, computation time, memory, and bandwidth requirements show significant improvement in the performance of the overall system.

AB In this paper, we present a blockchain-based mobile edge computing (B-MEC) framework for adaptive resource allocation and computation offloading in future wireless networks, where the blockchain works as an overlaid system to provide management and control functions. In this framework, how to reach a consensus between the nodes while simultaneously guaranteeing the performance of both MEC and blockchain systems is a major challenge. Meanwhile, resource allocation, block size, and the number of consecutive blocks produced by each producer are critical to the performance of B-MEC. Therefore, an adaptive resource allocation and block generation scheme is proposed. To improve the throughput of the overlaid blockchain system and the quality of services (QoS) of the users in the underlaid MEC system, spectrum allocation, size of the blocks, and number of producing blocks for each producer are formulated as a joint optimization problem, where the time-varying wireless links and computation capacity of the MEC servers are considered. Since this problem is intractable using traditional methods, we resort to the deep reinforcement learning approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing with other baseline methods.

AB Social media analytics is very critical in modem supply chain operations management (SCOM). However, in terms of methods, conducting social media analytics (SMA) for SCOM faces many challenges. Problems such as data accuracy (e.g., fake data), user privacy, data security, etc. are all present. Recently, with the emergence of blockchain technology (BCT), many new social media apps and platforms are developed. Motivated by the fact that (i) SMA is important for SCOM, (ii) the traditional social media (TSM) has insufficiency, and (iii) the "blockchain technology supported social media" (BSM) platforms have emerged, we explore whether and how the BSM would enhance social media analytics for SCOM. To be specific, by reviewing papers published in leading SCOM journals, we identify the applications and limitations of SMA for SCOM. Then, we conduct real case studies to examine the shortcomings of the TSM platforms and reveal features of their BSM counterparts. We investigate how the blockchain technology would potentially improve the use of SMA for SCOM. Finally, a future research agenda is proposed,

AB The initial coin offering is usually defined as a new, innovative way of raising funds used by organizations, companies, or entrepreneurs, attracting funds through a cryptographic exchange in exchange for the coins that can be sold, used for future products or services purchase or profit. This article provides an overview of the evolving ICO market and indicates the main advantages and risks of the ICO. It is pointed out that ICO offers many advantages, such as high liquidity, return on investment, availability, fast capital raising process, minimization of capital raising costs. Nonetheless, the noticeable benefits of ICOs are often available only when companies or investors agree to take considerable risks, caused by the information asymmetry, lack of investor protection, proper regulation and methodical guidance both for investors and entrepreneurs. Considering the novelty, volatility, emerging risks, growing popularity of the ICO market and the lack of research in the scientific literature, it is important to investigate the factors that influence the success of the ICO, which is usually defined as the amount of funds attracted, listing of the coins, return on investment, market capitalization or the duration of the ICO.

AB With the interest and attention that the Blockchain and the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) ham recently demanded, the technology is advancing at a very high rate. With investors and applications in a wide variety of fields, a lot of funding and efforts are being driven into bringing the technology to everyday use. The community and companies are coming up with new ways to collaborate, which makes the blockchain ecosystem evoke at full tilt. Consequently, this paper's aim is to review the academic and grey literature and to provide readers with information about the evolution, benefits and challenges of the Public Distributed Ledger Technologies and to discuss the latest solutions, which are being developed for bringing decentralization closer to the mainstream. The paper reviews the Directed Acylic Graph (DAG) structured distributed ledgers with focus on the Hedera Hashgraph, a novelty DLT bringing a unique consensus algorithm with new use-cases enabled by new cryptoeconomic mechanisms, as well as vital services, such as Solidity smart contracts and distributed file storage. Then, we are going to explore second-layer network protocols, a major topic fer solving sea/ability issues and for decentralizing cryptocurrency exchanges. The article tries also to identify the particularities of these technologies and how they bring specific answers to the blockchain trilemma, consisting in three themes - scalability, interoperability and sustainability.

AB With the advent of cloud computing, outsourcing a computation has become a common practice. A client, to have greater confidence in computations performed by the cloud, should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. Two approaches are followed to verify the correctness of the results: (1) Proof-based verifiable computing and (2) Replication-based Verifiable Computing. The first approach uses cryptography techniques, whereas the second approach follows game-theoretic methods. Although both approaches are almost perfect solutions to verify the results, they do not discuss fairness in verifiable computing.
   In this paper, we consider the problem of fairness in verifiable cloud computing, which means that the cloud gets the payment from a client for an outsourced computation if and only if the client receives the correct output of the computation. Most of the existing solutions rely on a trusted third-party to realise fairness. Motivated by the recent advances in blockchain technology and smart contracts, we propose protocols for different verifiable computing techniques using smart contracts. We first present a smartc-ontract based solution for fair proof-based verifiable computation and show that the overhead of using smart-contract is almost negligible when both client and cloud are honest. Then we show two different solutions depending upon the number of clouds hired to achieve fairness in replication-based verifiable computing. We have designed our protocols in the Blockchain model of cryptography and proved their security under universally composable theory. We also show the financial and transactional cost analysis of proposed contracts by implementing them in solidity and running them on Ethereum Blockchain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We are entering into an era of new technological possibilities. Many benefits will be derived for consumers from the development of data and computer-driven innovation. We will have new products and services and new ways of making and supplying goods and services.Without wanting to inhibit innovation, this article calls for the legal system to remain committed to an ideology and legal framework that supports consumer protection. It will counsel against assuming that the law should give way unduly to the technology agenda, whilst accepting that adaptations should be made and also that there should be a critical review of whether traditional forms of regulation are needed in the Fourth Industrial Age.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB While the different positive and negative impacts of digitalization for consumers' everyday lives gain much attention from both policy-makers and academia, the question on how digital technologies can be applied to better attain consumer policy goals has so far earned comparatively little consideration. This paper endeavours to fill this gap by analysing the potential of what this paper calls consumer protection technologies. With this term, digital technologies are described that are used to foster consumer policy objectives. The paper then argues that these new digital technologies can significantly contribute to the attainment of priority consumer policy outcomes, namely consumer protection, consumer empowerment as well as consumer law and rights enforcement. Yet, both more awareness of consumer policy actors and academics for the potential of these digital technologies as well as a systematic review of consumer protection technologies are needed.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up a new dimension for smart farming and agriculture because of the natural feature that makes it possible to assign tasks made by a user or that transfers agriculture data obtained through sensors to producers for analysis on various terminal devices. In recent years, heightened interest in agriculture data has arisen since the commercialization of precision agriculture technology. Agriculture data are known to be messy, especially from combine yield monitors, and analysts are concerned with the validity of data, especially given that other people may have impacted data quality at various steps along the data path. The blockchain can be a possible solution to the analyst's problem of uncertain data quality from prior data manipulation since it ensures data have not been inappropriately manipulated or at the very least documents what changes have been made by specific individuals. This paper proposes a blockchain-based fish farm platform to ensure agriculture data integrity. The designed platform aims to provide fish farmers with secure storage for preserving the large amounts of agriculture data that cannot be tampered with. Diverse processes of the fish farm are executed automatically by using the smart contract to reduce the risk of error or manipulation. A proof of concept that integrates a legacy fish farm system with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is implemented on top of the proposed architecture. The efficiency and usability of the proposed platform are demonstrated through a series of experiments using various metrics.

AB The dawn of the 21st century has seen the advent of many technologies targeting commercial and financial sectors. These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology.
   Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real. The exploration revealed that due to the exponential uses of blockchain, investments involved, and a number of start-up businesses contributing to Industry 4.0, blockchain indeed has a credible potential in the construction industry.

AB With the rapid development of E-Learning, the demand for high-quality personalized education services and resources has increased rapidly. In order to meet this demand, a project called "Digital Education Crowdfunding and Crowdcreating Personalized Service Platform Development and Application Demonstration" was launched in China. The goal of the project is to provide a personalized education resource and service trading platform for producers, suppliers, and users by joint investment and collaborative creation. So how to ensure the authenticity and credibility of the objects (education resources and services) involved in this multi-party participated service platform becomes a challenging task. Blockchain is emerging as a promising technology that enables people to make secure and reliable transactions because of the decentralization and collective maintenance features. Thus in this letter we proposed a novel blockchain-based authentication service for digital education transaction object to resolve the problem of education transaction object authentication among different education institutions. We constructed information models for the two types object and stored the metadata information of the model on the blockchain to make it transparent and safe. And smart contracts are designed to authenticate education transaction object automatically among different education institutions. To improve the performance of blockchain-based authentication service, an improved consensus process for blockchain network is proposed and incorporated into our prototype system. Performance simulation is carried out and the experimental results demonstrate the practicality of our blockchain-based authentification service.

AB Sensor nodes play a major role in IoT environment, and each sensor is a peer to peer networking. Due to limited physical size, IoT sensor nodes must have light-weight authentication protocol. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of various technical elements. It is expected that interworking between heterogeneous terminals, networks, and applications. They will accelerate through the liberalization of the IoT platform. As a result, many technical and administrative security threats will arise in the IoT environment. Sensor node protocols must be light-weight and secure. As IoT devices are used for various purposes, for some devices that require performance, the OS with a high-performance chipset that works, most passwords protocol. However, to turn on / off the lights IoT devices that perform simple tasks such as based on a low-performance chipset with no OS running. If it does not support encryption protocol or certificate, then it is vulnerable, and it does not have enough performance to handle. Therefore, in this paper, Block-chain-based IoT device is proposed to get a more secure authentication scheme.

AB Blockchain enables users to be autonomous without the need of trust by using a digital ledger of decentralized consensus. Blockchain-based IoT allows service providers to transfer the security and maintenance responsibility to self-maintaining customers. Adopting peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and computing for more than billions of transactions can reduce the costs arising from the installation and maintenance of centralized systems. Small manufacturers providing industrial IoT (IIoT) services can participate more actively in blockchain-based IIoT applications with three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing technologies, but the measure to maintain privacy on a blockchain is not robust. Here, we propose a P2P networking-based custom manufacturing service, which is an order-driven trading service between a manufacturer and a customer in the blockchain-based IIoT architecture. The proposed system consists of reputation management and service architecture. We propose a new reputation assessment method customized to increase the reliability and accuracy of industrial manufacturing systems. We also propose a manufacturer rating classification to guide the customers' decision making in a reliable manner and a malicious evaluator identification to exclude feedbacks from malicious evaluators. The proposed service architecture is composed of trustless P2P protocols designed for preserving privacy and providing non-repudiation. We used a cryptographic algorithm for ensuring transaction privacy and the digital signing of blockchain for non-repudiation. We also analyzed the proposed service architecture and the possible attack scenarios to verify the security requirements. We verified that the reputation management system was influenced by each feedback dynamically and guided the customer's present decision making with reliable and classified manners, by simulating reputation classification and malicious evaluator identification. Further, we have summarized the originality and the characteristics of the proposed approach by comparing closely related studies and concluded with a future research guide.

AB Currently, significant amounts of IoT data are being collected as big data for deep neural network learning algorithms that are used to extract meaningful information from big data and applied to various areas. However, a neural network's over-fitting problem and rising computational costs associated with high levels of time complexity are obstacles to deep learning computations. Because of these problems, response delays are prevalent in big data learning processes and data extraction processes that use deep neural networks, which exponentially increase the cost of data extraction. Therefore, the amount of computation must be controlled so that data processing models can be used practically, and various dedicated devices can be used to process big data, including methods such as distributed processing methods. In general, a P2P method is a typical distributed processing method. P2P is based on traffic distribution and cooperation, and edge computing is a method that increases efficiency by locally processing large volumes of data produced and only transmitting essential information. If P2P method-based edge computing techniques are used, an effective parallel processing model can be constructed, reducing the computing requirements of a central server and the load of a network. In this paper, we propose an edge computing health model using P2P-based deep neural networks. The proposed method is used to process health big data in edge computing. To construct the model, multiple edge nodes are required, and the edge node modules are deployed at locations where health data are produced and directly connected to the deep neural network model. At the edge nodes, a modularized deep neural network is constructed, thereby implementing a parallel big data processing system. In addition, a single server is required for gathering the results of a neural network model, and because the server only collects evaluation results and provides them to the users, the response time delay is improved. In this paper, to evaluate an improved response time, a regular server model and an edge computing health model are constructed separately, and positive numerical values are extracted from the experiments. The extraction results confirm that a combination of parallel processing models and deep neural network techniques can be used to distribute and process computing operations of big data size, ensuring an effective system for reducing response time delay.

AB The energy blockchain is a distributed Internet protocol for energy transactions between nodes in power systems. The consensus algorithm is the core component of the energy blockchain and has an essential impact on its application. At present, in the implementation of the energy blockchain, there are problems such as low transaction throughput (transactions per second) and high latency, which cannot meet the application requirements of real-time processing transactions in the energy field. To this end, according to the analysis of conventional blockchain consensus algorithm and traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm, a dynamic-reputation practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm for the energy blockchain is proposed. The dynamic-reputation practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm adopts a credit-based consortium node consensus election method. The monitoring node divides the remaining nodes into two types of nodes according to the reputation value: the consensus node and the secondary node, which, respectively, participate in different stages of the block generation process, and dynamically update the consensus nodes with low reputation ratings. By constructing the experimental platform simulation, the test results verify the effectiveness of the dynamic-reputation practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm. Compared with the algorithm of the fabric platform, the dynamic-reputation practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm improves the transaction processing speed and is suitable for the blockchain application in the energy field.

AB With the tremendous development in distributed ledger technology, assimilation of tokenization in sustainable assets has been a proof of concept. This paper is a documentation of ERC20 standards where cryptocontracts are an evident implementation of WRC tokens. Issuing and earning of these token credits rely on aggregate hazardous waste released into water as a by-product and careful monitoring of water quality standards (after treatment) using IOT sensors. The minting of this token currency is put forth by exchanging ether. This research is twofold attempt to eliminate the differences between Small and Medium Enterprise and large-scale Enterprises and to establish a business ground with equal opportunity of earning credits based on recycled wastewater.

AB Blockchain offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation in financial transactions. A whole new world of opportunities for banking, lending, insurance, money transfer, investments, and stock markets awaits. However, the potential for wide-scale adoption of blockchain is hindered with cybersecurity and privacy issues. We provide an overview of the risks and security requirements and give an outlook for future research that could be helpful in solving some of the challenges. We also present an approach for policy specification and verification of financial transactions based on smart contracts.

AB Purpose This paper investigates the latest achievements of studies on industrial information integration engineering (IIIE). Design/methodology/approach This paper extends the research by Chen (2016) by reviewing studies from 2016 to 2019 in IEEE Xplore and Web of Science. Altogether, 970 papers related to IIIE are grouped into 27 research categories and reviewed. Findings The results obtained in this study indicate that the number of research studies on IIIE rose drastically in the past three years compared with the findings in Chen (2016). Particularly, energy, engineering, industrial control, information and communications technologies, instrumentation, manufacturing and transportation are the hot topics. This change proves that the Internet of things (IoT) and IIIE have integrated closely by providing more applications, such as industrial Internet of things (IIoT), cyber-physical system (CPS), smart grids and smart manufacturing. This change also proves the research direction of IIIE identified by Chen (2016). Originality/value The results present up-to-date development of IIIE and provide directions for future research on IIIE. The review identifies that energy, engineering, industrial control, information and communications technologies, instrumentation, manufacturing and transportation are the main fields that most of the reviewed papers focus on. Applications that integrate IoT and IIIE, including IIoT, CPS, smart grids and smart manufacturing, are attracting scholars' and practitioners' attention. Some new technologies, such as 5G and blockchain, have the potential to be integrated with IoT and IIIE.

AB Since the seminal work by Hanson (2003), the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) has become the de facto market-maker mechanism for prediction markets. We suggest in this paper three potential issues with centralized implementations of LMSR, which we refer to as the availability, security, and privacy problems. We also explain how a permissioned blockchain-based implementation of LMSR effectively solves all the above problems. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), our main contribution is a fully functional permissioned blockchain-based implementation of LMSR that is ready to be deployed. We believe our results are of great value not only to prediction market researchers and practitioners looking for LMSR implementations, but also to blockchain professionals looking for fully developed solutions as well as applications of suitable research frameworks to guide blockchain research and development.

AB As the great prevalence of various Internet of Things (IoT) terminals, how to solve the problem of isolated information among different IoT platforms attracts attention from both academia and industry. It is necessary to establish a trusted access system to achieve secure authentication and collaborative sharing. Therefore, this article proposes a distributed and trusted authentication system based on blockchain and edge computing, aiming to improve authentication efficiency. This system consists of physical network layer, blockchain edge layer and blockchain network layer. Through the blockchain network, an optimized practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm is designed to construct a consortium blockchain for storing authentication data and logs. It guarantees trusted authentication and achieves activity traceability of terminals. Furthermore, edge computing is applied in blockchain edge nodes, to provide name resolution and edge authentication service based on smart contracts. Meanwhile, an asymmetric cryptography is designed, to prevent connection between nodes and terminals from being attacked. And a caching strategy based on edge computing is proposed to improve hit ratio. Our proposed authentication mechanism is evaluated with respect to communication and computation costs. Simulation results show that the caching strategy outperforms existing edge computing strategies by 6%-12% in terms of average delay, and 8%-14% in hit ratio.

AB Achieving low latency and providing real-time services are two of several key challenges in conventional cloud-based smart grid systems, and hence, there has been an increasing trend of moving to edge computing. While there have been a number of cryptographic protocols designed to facilitate secure communications in smart grid systems, existing protocols generally do not support conditional anonymity and flexible key management. Thus, in this article, we introduce a blockchain-based mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for edge-computing-based smart grid systems. Specifically, leveraging blockchain, the protocol can support efficient conditional anonymity and key management, without the need for other complex cryptographic primitives. The security analysis shows that the protocol achieves reasonable security assurance, and the comparative summary for security and efficiency also suggests the potential of the proposed protocol in a smart grid deployment.

In this article, a blockchain-based trusted data management scheme (called BlockTDM) in edge computing is proposed to solve the above problems, in which we proposed a flexible and configurable blockchain architecture that includes mutual authentication protocol, flexible consensus, smart contract, block and transaction data management, blockchain nodes management, and deployment. The BlockTDM scheme can support matrix-based multichannel data segment and isolation for sensitive or privacy data protection, and moreover, we have designed user-defined sensitive data encryption before the transaction payload stores in blockchain system, and have implemented conditional access and decryption query of the protected blockchain data and transactions through smart contract. Finally, we have evaluated the proposed BlockTDM scheme security, availability, and efficiency with large amount of experiments. Analysis and evaluations manifest that the proposed BlockTDM scheme provides a general, flexible, and configurable blockchain-based paradigm for trusted data management with tamper-resistance, which is suitable for edge computing with high-level security and creditability.

AB Today's globalized and highly competitive world market has broadened the spectrum of requirements in all the sectors of the agri-food industry. This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud.

AB Novel technologies are continually being developed every day. Lessons from the past show that some resulted in unintended harm to the Earth's system. The challenge for organizations working at the interface of the environment, technology, and society is, therefore, how to best harness the environmental benefits from new technologies while minimizing their potential adverse effects. Here, we identify some of the emerging technologies that the international development community needs to consider as it seeks to take advantage of new technologies to promote sustainable development. There are several innovations - such as blockchain, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cellular agriculture, and gene editing techniques that could either positively or negatively affect the environment, food security, human health, and the transition to clean energy. Some of their benefits and potential environmental and socio-economic concerns are discussed. We further suggest actions that can be taken by organizations involved in sustainable development, such as the United Nations and other global and regional bodies, to exploit the benefits from novel technologies and mitigate their risks.

AB Today, the blockchain is synonymous of technological innovation, being recognized among the 10 top strategy technologies in 2018 by the consulting company Gartner, it is more and more adopted in different sectors. However, the initial enthusiasm around this technology is going beyond the peak of inflated expectations, towards more stable applications in money transactions, cryptocurrencies and Digital Commodity Exchanges. Essentially, misguided efforts, the overuse of blockchain, and the Bitcoin's price drop have been the main reasons for this decay in expectations. Nevertheless, the exploitation of the blockchain technology in the power systems area appears largely underexplored, furthermore, the relation to the physical asset makes the blockchain application more complex but also more reliable and related to measurable benefits. The most common applications in the power systems area relate to the energy market. When the blockchain technology is indeed applied to the energy field, the term energy blockchain is used. This article aims to propose a wide perspective about the application of the blockchain technology in the power systems area, clarifying some technical aspects concerning this promising technology, the features and applications developed so far, while focusing on the future of innovative applications in the electrical energy sector.

AB Blockchain aims to transform businesses and other forms of transactions from a centralized, human-based to a shared, algorithm-based trust model, which enables a new risk management paradigm. Misaligned incentives in different principal - agent scenarios are important risk factors from governance point of view. With blockchain, these misalignments are accounted for algorithmically, therefore novel governance models are possible. What role do risks play in terms of deciding for, or against the adoption of blockchain? How to best define requirements to achieve it? This paper explores standards and risk as factors, which can support or hinder the sustained application of blockchain in a broad scope of environments. We conducted a systematic literature review that outlines a current understanding of perceived risk surrounding the adoption and use of blockchain technology in the context of requirements engineering. Furthermore, selected models for managing risks are presented. Finally, areas where deeper research is required are identified. We conclude that a gap exists in normative frameworks that affect the adoption and sustainable use of blockchain technology. Closing this gap can support the sustainable use of blockchain technology.

AB This article presents the first-ever blockchain that can simultaneously handle device and data security, which is important for the emerging Internet-of-Everything (IoE). It presents a unique concept of blockchain that integrates hardware security primitives called physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to solve scalability, latency, and energy requirement challenges and is called PUFchain. This article also introduces a new consensus algorithm called "Proof of PUF-Enabled Authentication" (PoP) for deployment in PUFchain. PoP is 1000 times faster than the well-established proof-of-work (PoW) and 5 times faster than proof-of-authentication (PoAh).

AB The smart device owning rate such as smart phone and smart watch is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many different areas. At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion. Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive. The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency. We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party. We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.

TI Blockchain-based accountability for multi-party oblivious RAM

AB Recently, oblivious random access machine (ORAM) has been widely used to prevent privacy leakage from user's access pattern. However, in multi-user scenarios, the obliviousness property of ORAM facilitates the malicious data modification by unauthorized users, which brings a new security challenge of user accountability to ORAM applications. Moreover, based on our observations, existing user accountability schemes for multi-user ORAM induce the extremely unacceptable overhead in both time and storage. What is worse, it is still inherent the traditional cloud accountability problem that the untrusted cloud server may have misbehavior on storing the outsourced data. In this paper, we focus on the issue that how to do accountability for both malicious users and untrusted cloud server without the independent trusted third party server.
   To address the above problem, we design and implement a Traceable Oblivious RAM, or T-ORAM for short, a cryptographic system that protects the privacy of users and the integrity of outsourced data based on group signatures. It can detect malicious users quickly by utilizing the traceability property of group signatures, and cost less storage overhead comparing with the existing solutions. Then, we further propose a more secure solution of Blockchain-based Traceable Oblivious RAM (BT-ORAM). Specifically, by introducing the blockchain technology, BT-ORAM can detect the malicious behavior from both malicious users and untrusted cloud server. BT-ORAM is the first accountability work for multi-user ORAM that deal with both malicious users and the untrusted cloud server. Finally, security analysis and experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art accountability work for oblivious RAM, S-GORAM, in both security and performance.

DE taxation; cryptocurrencies; collaborative economy
AB The crypto economy is a new technic-economic concept that is emerging thanks to recent technological developments such as blockchain. It allows the establishment of new large-scale collaborative environments based on decentralized systems. Even so, in the same way as the traditional economy, this new economic paradigm is also subject to tax directives and laws. In this article, therefore, we review some of the opportunities that the new technology provides, from the point of view of tax. The aim is to determine in which cases incomes are subject to taxation or not, in all cases according to Spanish legislation and doctrine.

ID OUTSOURCED DATABASE; SECURE; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Group data sharing enables information sharing between multiple parties for cooperative purposes. However, the existing schemes only consider scenarios in which all parties in the same organization want to share data. Achieving secure data sharing between users of different groups is also a relevant research issue. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing scheme for multiple groups with anonymity and traceability. Owing to the consortium blockchain technique, any user in the system can easily verify the validity of the shared data without interacting with a third-party auditor. Additionally, the proposed scheme can not only enable data sharing between different groups with enhanced security anonymously but also achieve traceability and non-frameability.

AB Blockchain technology is an interlinked systematic chain of blocks that contains transaction history and other user data. It works under the principle of decentralized distributed digital ledger. This technology enables cryptographically secure and anonymous fmancial transactions among the user nodes of the network enabling the transactions to be validated and approved by all the users in a transparent environment. It is a revolutionary technology that earned its emerging popularity through the usage of digital cryptocurrencies. Even though Blockchain holds a promising scope of development in the online transaction system, it is prone to several security and vulnerability issues. In this paper, blockchain methodology, its applications, and security issues are discussed which might shed some light on blockchain enthusiasts and researchers.

AB The blockchain applications have attracted a larger interest in the research community following its recent success in the financial industry of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology in which, all transactions or events take place in a trustless peer-to-peer network without involving intermediaries. Considering the recent technological advancements, blockchain has the potential to revamp heterogeneous business models across different industries. Though it promises a secure distributed framework to smoother the exchanging, sharing and integration of information across all the users and third parties, it is important for the planners and decision-makers to carefully analyze it's secure application and suitability in different industry and business. The blockchain should be considered only where applicable and provides a better security and opportunities in cost reduction and obtaining increased revenues. Therefore, this paper proposes the blockchain as a decentralized cybersecurity framework by employing the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology for innovative information systems. This methodology employs a specific set of concepts and principles to develop IT based solutions. The proposed Threat and Vulnerability Blockchain (TVB) framework is suitable for encouraging mass security experts to discover new threats and vulnerabilities. This article also presents an overview of this technology for realization of security across distributed parties in an impregnable and transparent way.

DE Bitcoin; Blockchain*; Consensus; Data privacy
AB This paper presents a new consensus algorithm, Proof of Usage (PoU), for the blockchain technology. This consensus is introduced for permissioned (or private) blockchains and is designed for a user-centric personal data market. This market is subject to specific regulations with which conventional blockchains fail to comply. Proof of Usage aims to promote a new paradigm dedicated to usage incentivization, valuation, and control of user data in various sectors, such as banking and insurance. Other consensuses such as Proof of Stake or historical Proof of Work do not encourage coin spending and usage (in fact, Proof of Stake promotes the opposite). However, the value of the currency mainly depends on its use. This paper first introduces a contextualization of blockchain technology and decentralized consensus models. The motivation is then discussed for a new model of personal data exchange in a decentralized but supervised environment. The PoU protocol and its process flow are defined in detail. Furthermore, the paper explores two different approaches regarding the reward mechanism and the incentive model. Finally, the paper focuses on security requirements and how PoU meets such requirements in a permissioned-based blockchain system.

DE Consensus mechanisms; CAP theorem; Blockchain; Peer-to-peer network
AB Blockchain is a disruptive technology that relies on the distributed nature of the peer-to-peer network while performing an agreement, or consensus, a mechanism to achieve an immutable, global, and consistent registry of all transactions. Thus, a key challenge in developing blockchain solutions is to design the consensus mechanism properly. As a consequence of being a distributed application, any consensus mechanism is restricted to offer two of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. In this paper, we survey the main consensus mechanisms on blockchain solutions, and we highlight the properties of each one. Moreover, we differentiate both deterministic and probabilistic consensus mechanisms, and we highlight coordination solutions that facilitate the data distribution on the blockchain, without the need for a sophisticated consensus mechanism.

AB Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular and attracted great interest in recent years. Beyond the financial sector, blockchain technologies are promising for addressing the current limitations in food supply chain management. As blockchain adoption for food supply chains is still in an early stage, it is significant to have a thematic framework to systematically understand the processes, benefits, and challenges. This paper aims to explore the adoption of blockchain technologies in food supply chains with a thematic analysis. Desktop research is conducted, and data is collected from online databases, including news article (e.g. Factiva) and research paper databases (e.g. Web of Science). Then we carry out a qualitative thematic analysis, according to the investigation processes suggested by Creswell. Based on the thematic analysis, we identify seven first-order themes and two second-order themes in adoption processes; thirteen first-order themes, sixteen second-order themes, and five third-order themes in benefits; and fourteen first-order themes and five second-order themes in challenges. In addition, we discuss and propose how to improve blockchain adoption in food supply chains in practice.

ID EMERGENCE
AB The proposition that constitutional rules serve as permanent, fixed points of interaction is challenged by the existence of contestable rule amendment and the emergence of de facto authority. This observation not only applies to conventional political constitutions, but to the fundamental rules which govern interactions by numerous people using new forms of technology. Blockchain technology aims to coordinate action in a world of incomplete information and opportunism, but the governance arrangements in blockchain protocols remain far from settled. Drawing upon recent theoretical developments regarding constitutional change, we interpret changes to the fundamental working rules of blockchain protocols as central to the adaptive, emergent nature of activity within this technological space. We apply this concept of "constitutional catallaxy" to selected blockchain platform case studies, illustrating the dynamism inherent in establishing protocols within the blockchain. Blockchain coordination changes and adapts not only to the technological limitations of the available protocols, but to mutual expectations and influence of interacting stakeholders.

AB This study looks into the current, and potential uses of Blockchain technology in business, specifically in Accounting and in cybersecurity. We relate Blockchain uses to current concerns within cybersecurity and accounting. We review the literature that includes topics such as Big Data in Accounting, blockchain's use in financial security and cybersecurity, and its use in financial accounting though the use of ledger technology and also as a system of tracking financial misconduct. We also review the Department of Homeland Security plan for cybersecurity over the next few years to understand what the US Government plans because of the importance of cybersecurity development. We show that Blockchain impacts auditing in different ways that will change the profession drastically. We also find that blockchain should be effectively implemented into different aspects of cybersecurity, and accounting, such as Auditing and general accounting procedures.

AB There is a wealth of information, hype around, and research into blockchain's 'disruptive' and 'transformative' potential concerning every industry. However, there is an absence of scholarly attention given to identifying and analyzing the political premises and consequences of blockchain projects. Through digital ethnography and participatory action research, this article shows how blockchain experiments personify 'prefigurative politics' by design: they embody the politics and power structures which they want to enable in society. By showing how these prefigurative embodiments are informed and determined by the underlying political imaginaries, the article proposes a basic typology of blockchain projects. Furthermore, it outlines a frame to question, cluster, and analyze the expressions of political imaginaries intrinsic to the design and operationalization of blockchain projects on three analytic levels: users, intermediaries, and institutions.

AB Purpose
   The short lifespan of digital signatures presents a challenge to the long-term preservation of digitally signed records. It can undermine attempts to presume, verify or assess their authenticity. This paper aims to investigate the challenges of the expiration of digital signatures in the context of digital archiving.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper identifies requirements for the long-term preservation of digitally signed records and compares them with the existing approaches. The characteristics, operational procedures and requirements of the technologies used for digital signatures are combined with the archival requirements to design a new model.
   Findings
   The paper proposes a new model of a blockchain-based system, which can be combined with any digital archive to assist the process of long-term preservation of digitally signed records.
   Originality/value
   The proposed TrustChain 2.0 model is based on previous research conducted as part of the InterPARES Trust project. It builds on TrustChain 1.0 by including digital signature certificate chain validity information in a blockchain thus avoiding the issues concerning records confidentiality and privacy information disclosure. The paper contributes not only to the development of archival science but also shows archival institutions on how to approach long-term preservation of digitally signed records.

AB Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition. However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02-05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06-15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.

AB Critical pedagogy is in crisis. To address this crisis, this paper reinvents Paulo Freire's concept of utopia in and for our age of the Anthropocene. Understood as a system, postdigital critical utopia provides us with normative foundations and returns agency from invisible data and algorithms to human beings. Understood as a process, postdigital critical utopia unmasks the myth of neutrality and adds an important element of myth, religion, ritual, and faith. Understood as an orientation, postdigital critical utopia needs to be balanced by dystopia, integrate environmental considerations, and act with a combination of epistemical curiosity and hope. Theoretical and practical attempts at introducing advanced technology to reimagine new utopias now take place in media theory, hacking, activism, and small pockets of the academia. To transcend its own crisis and remain relevant, contemporary critical pedagogy movement must urgently join these attempts. However, catching up with technological development is only the tip of a much larger iceberg. In order to take the lead in processes of modernization, critical pedagogy movement needs to actively develop utopian visions and techno-administrative systems which may support these visions.

TI Inner For-Loop for Speeding Up Blockchain Mining
SO OPEN COMPUTER SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; Network; Inner for-loop; SHA-256; Brute force
AB In this paper, the authors propose to increase the efficiency of blockchain mining by using a populationbased approach. Blockchain relies on solving difficult mathematical problems as proof-of-work within a network before blocks are added to the chain. Brute force approach, advocated by some as the fastest algorithm for solving partial hash collisions and implemented in Bitcoin blockchain, implies exhaustive, sequential search. It involves incrementing the nonce (number) of the header by one, then taking a double SHA-256 hash at each instance and comparing it with a target value to ascertain if lower than that target. It excessively consumes both time and power. In this paper, the authors, therefore, suggest using an inner for-loop for the population-based approach. Comparison shows that it's a slightly faster approach than brute force, with an average speed advantage of about 1.67% or 3,420 iterations per second and 73% of the time performing better. Also, we observed that the more the total particles deployed, the better the performance until a pivotal point. Furthermore, a recommendation on taming the excessive use of power by networks, like Bitcoin's, by using penalty by consensus is suggested.

TI Incentives in Ethereum's hybrid Casper protocol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB We present an overview of hybrid Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), a proof-of-stake checkpointing protocol overlaid onto Ethereum's proof-of-work blockchain. We describe its core functionalities and reward scheme and explore its properties. Our findings indicate that Casper's implemented incentives mechanism ensures liveness, while providing safety guarantees that improve over standard proof-of-work protocols. On the basis of a minimal impact implementation of the protocol as a smart contract on the blockchain, we discuss additional issues related to parametrization, funding, throughput, and network overhead and detect potential limitations.

AB Blockchain technology has been enjoying rapid development in numerous areas where trust, safety, and global payments are deemed important. In this research, we introduce a framework that integrates blockchain technology with the emerging concept of cloud manufacturing. It has the potential to dramatically improve the feasibility and applicability of cloud manufacturing. Our focus is on the pricing strategies for service providers in bidding for jobs in such a system. A scenario is developed based on cloud additive manufacturing services. A game theoretic approach for pricing simulation is proposed in the research, and a fuzzy algorithm is employed in the pricing decision. Two pricing policies are considered: one is that the information of players is unknown to each other, and the other is that the information of players who are within a limit of Euclidean space is known to each other. The effects of system load and the weight coefficients in KNN recommendation algorithm are also studied. The results show that the pricing policy has significant effect on revenue generation for providers, and the increase of system load helps to grow revenue for providers only when the machine utilization is low and job waiting time is short. In addition, the system seems to be less sensitive to the change of KNN weights in terms of individual provider and system revenues.

AB This article analyzes specific characteristics of value created through digital scarcity and blockchain-proven ownership in cryptogames. Our object of study is CryptoKitties, the first instance of a blockchain-based game that has garnered media recognition and financial interest. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the limits of scarcity in value construction for owners of CryptoKitties tokens, manifested as breedable virtual cats. Our work extends the trends set out by earlier cryptocurrency studies from the perspective of cultural studies. For the purpose of this article, we rely on open blockchain analytics such as DappRadar and Etherscan, as well as player-created analytics, backed by a one-year-long participant observation period in the said game for research material. Combining theoretical cryptocurrency and Bitcoin studies, open data analysis, and virtual ethnography enables a grounded discussion on blockchain-based game design and play.

DT Article
ID BIG DATA; OPPORTUNITIES; BLOCKCHAIN
AB The European Union (EU) initiative on the Digital Transformation of Health and Care (Digicare) aims to provide the conditions necessary for building a secure, flexible, and decentralized digital health infrastructure. Creating a European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC) within this environment should enable data sharing and analysis for health research across the EU, in compliance with data protection legislation while preserving the full trust of the participants. Such a HRIC should learn from and build on existing data infrastructures, integrate best practices, and focus on the concrete needs of the community in terms of technologies, governance, management, regulation, and ethics requirements. Here, we describe the vision and expected benefits of digital data sharing in health research activities and present a roadmap that fosters the opportunities while answering the challenges of implementing a HRIC. For this, we put forward five specific recommendations and action points to ensure that a European HRIC: i) is built on established standards and guidelines, providing cloud technologies through an open and decentralized infrastructure; ii) is developed and certified to the highest standards of interoperability and data security that can be trusted by all stakeholders; iii) is supported by a robust ethical and legal framework that is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); iv) establishes a proper environment for the training of new generations of data and medical scientists; and v) stimulates research and innovation in transnational collaborations through public and private initiatives and partnerships funded by the EU through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe.

TI Global carbon surcharge for the reduction of anthropogenic emission of
   carbon dioxide
SO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Global carbon surcharge; Climate policy; Decarbonization; Carbon pricing
AB Background Many governments take the view that voluntary national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to avoid negative climate effects. In the absence of independent verification, however, pledges are unlikely to be sufficient for a rapid and strong reduction of emissions. It is often claimed that a global carbon tax could be an effective instrument. However, such a tax is difficult to set and to collect, especially in countries with poor administrative infrastructure. Results Here, we formulate and discuss a novel approach, the Global Carbon Surcharge (GCS), that mimics a carbon tax but does not require tax collection by governments. We define GCS as a requirement or a voluntary commitment encompassing all companies extracting carbon-carrying raw materials, namely coal, oil, gas and limestone, with the aim to burden their extraction with costs proportional to their carbon intensity. GCS mandates all companies to store these materials immediately after mining for a given period of time in the vicinity of the production site. Thereby, GCS generates additional costs that propagate through all sectors of the global economy. We elucidate how the investment costs for the storage infrastructure translate into surcharges on the raw materials. Conclusions We show that by a proper choice of the storage time and the size of the storage unit, GCS becomes equivalent to a carbon tax in the range between 50 and 100 euro per ton of CO2 that is assumed to be necessary for the transition to a carbon-neutral energy system. An attractive feature of GCS is that it can be verified, in particular by citizens themselves, using publicly available satellite data. Finally, if compulsory storage is coupled to blockchain-based smart contracts and a mandatory (expensive) mining of cryptocurrency, GCS can be operated without governmental protectionism, corruption and fraud. However, the main uncertainties of the GCS approach lie in the substantial expansion of infrastructure and the fact that the induced price effects must be sufficient to achieve a rapid and far-reaching substitution of fossil fuels.

AB The used car market is characterized by information asymmetries and mistrust. Blockchain technology promises to resolve these problems using a system which stores data over the life cycle of a vehicle. However, while blockchain technology is strong in preserving the stored information, sense-making of this information is still essential to bring value to end consumers of the system. In this paper, we take an exploratory approach and create a prototype, which is then evaluated in realistic car sale conversations between buyers and sellers. We demonstrate and discuss how the interplay of different design elements of an application, built on top of a blockchain-based platform, helps to reduce information asymmetries and enhance trust. Our findings suggest that though providing more information about a used product (a car) leads to fewer information asymmetries in general, a reputation mechanism and data analysis are both beneficial in improving the situation further. As for trust, such a system enhances trust between buyers and sellers and, in general, makes the overall purchase process more trustworthy. However, to achieve these positive effects, the quality of the stored information should be guaranteed and properly communicated to the end-user.

TI Weighted voting on the blockchain: Improving consensus in proof of stake
   protocols
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID RULES
AB Proof of stake (PoS) protocols rely on voting mechanisms to reach consensus on the current state. If an enhanced majority of staking nodes, also called validators, agree on a proposed block, then this block is appended to the blockchain. Yet these protocols remain vulnerable to faults caused by validators who abstain either accidentally or maliciously. To protect against such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate our results to the design of current PoS protocols.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to assist records managers and information governance professionals to understand the challenges presented by their organization's use of blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT).
   Design/methodology/approach
   An extensive literature review was conducted, which revealed a multitude of articles based on research into blockchain DLT, most written from the technology perspective. This paper differs in that it applies a records management lens to an analysis of the records created, registered or stored on a blockchain. A six-stage blockchain records consideration model is provided to illustrate examples of the records management challenges presented by the implementation of blockchain DLT. Questions are posed and recommendations are made to aid the reader in developing a blockchain DLT records management and information governance strategy.
   Findings
   Because there is no one universal configuration for a blockchain DLT solution, each implementation must be analyzed to understand the resultant records management and information governance challenges. A series of questions that should be asked and answered can not only help records management and information governance professionals adapt their policies and practices to the technology but also provide a basis for discussion with those designing the blockchain DLT solutions so they can include records management features in their designs.
   Originality/value
   This paper contributes an original analysis of the implications of the adoption of Blockchain DLT for records management and information governance programs through the lens of a six-stage Blockchain Records Consideration Model.

TI Blockchain moderated by empty blocks to reduce the energetic impact of
   crypto-moneys
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB While cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications continue to gain popularity, their energy cost is evidently becoming unsustainable. In most instances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability (in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical effectiveness.
   In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees a tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size of the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based on the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional difference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of (what we denote as) "empty blocks" which aim are to call regular blocks following a staircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides tunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation. We also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme is resilient to unfair competitive investments (e.g., "51 percent" attack) and block nursing.

DE Decentralized authorization; Interledger; Flashed time-lock contracts;
   Constrained IoT environments
AB We present models that utilize smart contracts and interledger mechanisms to provide decentralized authorization for constrained IoT devices. The models involve different tradeoffs in terms of cost, delay, complexity, and privacy, while exploiting key advantages of smart contracts and multiple blockchains that communicate with interledger mechanisms. These include immutably recording hashes of authorization information and policies in smart contracts, resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes, and cryptographically linking transactions and IoT events recorded on different blockchains using hash-lock and time-lock mechanisms. In the case of two ledgers, an authorization and a payment ledger, the authorization ledger can be a private Ethereum network or a permissioned ledger such as Hyperledger Fabric. For decentralized authorization where a subset of m-out-of-n authorization servers are required, we present two policies for selecting the in servers. The first policy can utilize statistics of the authorization servers such as transaction cost and response time. The second policy selects the first m servers that respond. The proposed models are evaluated on the public Ethereum testnets Rinkeby and Ropsten, and for different implementations on the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned ledger, in terms of execution cost (gas), delay, and reduction of data that needs to be sent to the constrained IoT devices.

TI Core-periphery organization of the cryptocurrency market inferred by the

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS

DT Article
ID HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION; NETWORKS; COMMUNITIES
AB Modularity matrix has long been used for inferring modular structure of stochastic networks of different scale-free nature. In this paper we show efficiency of the modularity to detect the core-periphery organization on the example of the cryptocurrency correlation-based network. The cryptocurrencies exemplify assets with dual macroeconomical background sharing properties of currency and stock markets with a non-obvious topological organization. We demonstrate that the modularity operator applied to a daily correlation-based network rules out community structure of the cryptocurrency market, simultaneously revealing stratification into a core and a periphery. Classification of tokens into two groups is shown to be day-dependent, however, stable tokens with statistically significant participation ratio can be easily identified. To approve the core-periphery organization of the stable assets, we compute the centrality measure of the two groups and show that it is considerably less for the periphery than for the core. Embedding of a subgraph of the stable tokens into the Euclidean space demonstrates clear spatial core-shell segregation. Furthermore, we show that the degree distribution of the minimal spanning tree has a distinctive power-law tail with exponent gamma approximate to -2.6 which makes the cryptomarket an archetypal example of the scale-free network. Economical reasoning suggests that the revealed topological motif is in the full agreement with the outliers hypothesis. The core is driven by traditionally liquid and highly capitalized tokens, resembling blockchain and payment systems, while the periphery is marked by the stable tokens with little exposure to the market. We report that the very center of the core is populated by tokens with strong financial usage, while main drivers of the market (such as ETH or XRP) turn out to locate in the middle layers. This is an clear evidence of speculative processes underlying formation and evolution of the market. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SECURITY
AB Cloud computing (CC) is a distributed and centralized network of interconnected and interrelated systems that has emerged as an area of incredible impact, potential, and growth in the IT domain. In the last few years, this paradigm has thrived to become the fastest evolutionary segment for business and various industries. Despite the many advantages provided by the cloud, serious challenges related to privacy and security have arisen such as privacy exposure, data loss, manipulation, service-level agreement (SLA) violation, and concerns over the service and deployment models. In this article, a blockchain-based hybrid algorithm is proposed to tackle the privacy inefficiency of existing tools. A novel hybrid technique is used to encrypt data ahead of outsourcing it to data centers, and a unique digital signature is generated at clients and stored on a decentralized set of blocks. A virtual cloud similar to actual cloud service infrastructure was built to test the proposed framework. Despite the additional computational powers needed to run the proposed framework due to blockchain integration, the results show that data integrity and reliability are preserved and user's privacy is increased. Our results are discussed and benchmarked against the standard privacy tests standards such as changes in the stored data, the negligible overheads on cloud performance, and the data records of the blockchain structure.

AB Clinical trials (CTs) are essential for the advancement of medical research, paving the way for the development and adoption of new treatments, and contributing to the evolution of healthcare. An essential factor for the success of a CT is the appropriate management of its participants and their personal data. According to the current regulations, collecting and using personal data from participants must comply with rigorous standards. Therefore, healthcare institutes need to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent before being able to collect the data. Some of the major limitations of the current technological solutions are the lack of control over the granularity of consent grants, as well as the difficulty of handling dynamic changes of consent over time. In this paper, we present SCoDES, an approach for trusted and decentralized management of dynamic consent in clinical trials, based on blockchain technology (BCT). The usage of blockchain provides a set of features that allow maintaining consent information with trust guarantees while avoiding the need for a dedicated or centralized third trusted party. We provide a full implementation of SCoDES, made available as a self-contained infrastructure, with the possibility to interact with external services, and using hyperledger as a blockchain framework.

AB Purpose
   Understanding a technology's patent landscape, including patent strategies, helps organizations position themselves regarding their innovation and provides insight about a technology's future direction. This study aims to provide an overview of the blockchain technology patenting trends and outlines an exploratory framework of patenting strategies for blockchain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A total of 3,234 registered patents are analyzed to determine the geographical distribution and identify key actors patenting around the globe. In addition, an empirical study consisting of multiple case studies in the form of ten in-depth interviews with owners/managers of organizations based in North America was conducted to understand organizations' strategies for patenting the blockchain technology.
   Findings
   Several novel insights regarding the strategies are used for blockchain technology patenting. For example, the existence of strong anti-patent sentiment which results in a lack of patenting by start-up organizations or has led to a form of open source patenting strategy. Larger organizations appear to be patenting defensively, and small to medium organizations are primarily patenting to defend their competitive advantage.
   Practical implications
   Start-up organizations harboring anti-patent sentiment should consider the open-source patenting strategy to ensure that the collaborative innovation network can continue. They should also consider collaborating with other actors within the network to have a competitive position in the market.
   Originality/value
   To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to conduct an empirical study with organizations currently using the blockchain technology to understand patenting strategies used for blockchain.

AB Blockchain is a new technology slowly integrating our economy with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and many more applications. Bitcoin and other versions of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new types of assets are characterized by wild swings in prices, and this can lead to large swings in profit and losses. To respond to these dynamics, cryptoinvestors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of portfolio selection and optimization. Bitcoin returns have shown some form of regime change, suggesting that regime-switching models could more adequately capture the volatility dynamics. This paper presents a two-state Markov-switching COGARCHR-vine (MSCOGARCH) model for cryptocurrency portfolio selection and compares the performance to the single-regime COGARCH-R-vine (COGARCH). The findings here are in line with the literature where MSCOGARCH outperforms the single-regime COGARCH with regard to the expected shortfall risk. The COGARCH specifications here capture the structural breaks and heavy tailness within each state of the Markov switching in order to achieve a minimal risk and a maximum return. The flexibility of R-vine copula allows adequate bivariate copula selection for each pair of cryptocurrencies to achieve suitable dependence structure through pair-copula construction architecture.

DE Blockchain; Selfish mining; Stalker attack; Distributed consensus
AB The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 as a distributed peer to peer network structure, capable of ensuring security for transactions made using the Bitcoin digital currency, without the need for third party intermediaries to validate them. Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.

AB Network intrusions are a big threat to network and system assets, which have become more complex to date. To enhance the detection performance, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) are adopted by many organizations to protect their resources. However, such detection systems or networks are typically vulnerable to insider attacks, so that there is a need to implement suitable trust mechanisms. In the literature, challenge-based trust mechanisms are able to measure the trustworthiness of a node by evaluating the relationship between the sent challenges and the received responses. In practice, challenge-based CIDNs have shown to be robust against common insider attacks, whereas it may still be susceptible to advanced insider attacks. How to enhance the robustness of such challenge-based CIDNs remains an issue. Motivated by the recent development of blockchains, in this work, our purpose is to design a blockchained challenge-based CIDN framework that aims to combine blockchains with challenge-based trust mechanism. Our evaluation demonstrates that blockchain technology has the potential to enhance the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs in the aspects of trust management (i.e., enhancing the detection of insider nodes) and alarm aggregation (i.e., identifying untruthful inputs) under adversary scenarios.

TI SecBCS: a secure and privacy-preserving blockchain-based crowdsourcing

AB A robust and scalable crowd management infrastructure is crucial in addressing operational challenges when deploying high-density sensors and actuators in a smart city. While crowdsourcing is widely used in crowd management, conventional solutions, such as Upwork and Amazon Mechanical Turk, generally depend on a trusted third-party platform. There exist several potential security concerns (e.g., sensitive leakage, single point of failure and unfair judgment) in such a centralized paradigm. Hence, a recent trend in crowdsourcing is to leverage blockchain (a decentralized ledger technology) to address some of the existing limitations. A small number of blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) with incentive mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, but they are generally not designed with security in mind. Thus, we study the security and privacy requirements of a secure BCS and propose a concrete solution (i.e., SecBCS) with a prototype implementation based on JUICE.

TI Analysis of blockchain protocol against static adversarial miners

AB Bitcoin, which was initially introduced by Nakamoto, is the most disruptive and impactive cryptocurrency. The core Bitcoin technology is the so-called blockchain protocol. In recent years, several studies have focused on rigorous analyses of the security of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol in an asynchronous network where network delay must be considered. Wei, Yuan, and Zheng investigated the effect of a long delay attack against Nakamoto's blockchain protocol. However, their proof only holds in the honest miner setting. In this study, we improve Wei, Yuan and Zheng's result using a stronger model where the adversary can perform long delay attacks and corrupt a certain fraction of the miners. We propose a method to analyze the converge event and demonstrate that the properties of chain growth, common prefix, and chain quality still hold with reasonable parameters in our stronger model.

AB The anonymity mechanism of bitcoin is favored by the society, which promotes its usage and development. An adversary should not be able to discover the relation between bitcoin addresses and bitcoin users to ensure effective privacy. However, the relation among bitcoin transactions can be used to analyze the bitcoin privacy information, which seriously jeopardizes the bitcoin anonymity. Herein, we describe the vulnerabilities associated with the anonymity mechanism of bitcoin, including the relation among bitcoin addresses and the relation among bitcoin users. Further, we demonstrate that the existing methods do not guarantee the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the analysis results. We propose a heuristic clustering method to judge the relation among bitcoin addresses and employ the Louvain method to discover the relation among bitcoin users. Subsequently, we construct an address-associated database of historical transactions and implement real-time updates. Extensive experiments are used to demonstrate the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Specifically, the proposed scheme reveals the privacy vulnerability associated with the blockchain technology. We expect that our scheme can be applied to improve the blockchain technology.

AB There has been tremendous interest in blockchain technology (BT) (also known as distributed ledger technology) around the globe and across sectors. Following significant success in the financial sector, other sectors, such as humanitarian sector, have started deploying BT at various levels. Although the use of BT in the humanitarian sector is in its infancy, donors and government agencies are increasingly calling for building BT-enabled swift-trust (ST) and more collaborative relationships among various humanitarian actors in order to improve the transparency and traceability of disaster relief materials, information exchanges and flow of funds in disaster relief supply chains. Our study, which is informed by organisational information processing theory and relational view, proposes a theoretical model to understand how BT can influence operational supply chain transparency (OSTC) and ST among actors engaged in disaster relief operations. Our model also shows how BT-enabled ST can further improve collaboration (CO) among actors engaged in disaster relief operations and enhance supply chain resilience (SCR). We formulated and tested six research hypotheses, using data gathered from international non-governmental organisations with the help of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) database. We received 256 usable responses using a pre-tested survey-based instrument designed for key informants. Our results confirm that our six hypotheses were supported. Our study offers significant and valid contributions to the literature on ST, CO and SCR and BT/distributed ledger technology. We have also noted the limitations of our study and have offered future research directions.

TI FastFabric: Scaling hyperledger fabric to 20 000 transactions per second
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we rearchitect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3000 to 20 000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.

AB With the development of intelligent vehicles, the research on road condition monitoring has attracted much attention in the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The combination of VANET, cloud computing, and fog computing provides on-demand computational resources while creating a lot of new challenges. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving cloud-fog-based traceable road surface condition monitoring scheme. We use certificateless aggregate signcryption technology to implement multiple messages aggregation verification, which greatly saves computing resources and bandwidth. Moreover, we also use a traceable vehicle pseudo identity generated by a trace authority (TRA) to achieve identity privacy protection. To ensure the privacy of the fog and cloud server, the road condition information is reported in ciphertext format. In addition, the cloud server can perform ciphertext equivalence test operation to distinguish different road condition information of the same area without compromising the confidentiality. The ciphertext, which exceeds the set threshold, is uploaded to the blockchain. It can be stored permanently and never be tampered with or deleted. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness of the proposed scheme and show that the proposed scheme has higher efficiency.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm branded by heterogeneous technologies composed of smart ubiquitous objects that are seamlessly connected to the Internet. These objects are often deployed in open environments to provide innovative services in various application domains such as smart cities, smart health, and smart communities. These IoT devices produce a massive amount of confidentiality and security-sensitive data. Thus, security of these devices is very important in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the system. In this paper, a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism is proposed for lightweight IoT devices and is applicable to a large number of scenarios. The mechanism is based on the technology of the fog computing and the concept of the public blockchain. The results gained from the experiments demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed mechanism when compared to a state-of-the-art blockchain-based authentication technique.

AB The study proposes a supply chain contractual coordination model based on the product lifecycle information sharing effort and consumers' price sensitivity to a product with the Blockchain system. This paper examined the following five scenarios: (1) centralized supply chain with Blockchain system-based product lifecycle information sharing investment; (2) Stackelberg leader retailer processed and invested Blockchain system scenario; (3) retailer processed the Blockchain system cost-sharing scenario; (4) retailer processed Blockchain system investment through bargaining the revenue-sharing model; (5) Blockchain system investment under the cost and revenue-sharing contract. The study used the game theory reverse induction method to compare the Nash equilibrium solutions under different decision-making scenarios and discussed the chain member's constraint condition of Blockchain system investment. We simulated and analysed the products' lifecycle information sharing effort cost factor, the influence of price sensitivity coefficient, and expected profits of the supplier and retailer. The study results show that the product lifecycle information sharing effort under the Blockchain system increases the profit of the whole chain and decreases with the increase of customer's price sensitivity coefficient.

AB In the past years numerous scandals in hiring processes of public institutions revealed significant weaknesses of the existing process. This lead to a lose of trust of citizens and applicants in these processes. Besides that, even honest processes often lack transparency for applicants, the company and, in the case of public institutions, also for citizens. Distributed ledger technology has been used in numerous past projects to establish trust between entities. Especially smart contracts have been a useful tool to execute programs in this setting. Thus, in the context of this project we developed an approach based on smart contracts to decentralize this process and improve its transparency and reliability. We enhance the system with game theory mechanics to encourage reviewers and candidates to participate honestly, further increasing the likelihood of a fair selection process. Nonetheless, not all blockchains support smart contracts and their usage comes with an elevated additional monetary cost. Due to that, in the blockchain environment, many businesses only emulate smart contracts by executing them on external servers which improves the scalability but decreases the decentralization. In the context of this, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of emulating smart contracts compared to native smart contracts in our concrete usage example. Our approach, compared to existing solutions, can be employed on any distributed ledger which allows to store some sort of metadata on the chain resulting in a significantly lower creation and maintenance cost (up to 30 times cheaper). The developed solution and discussion gives useful insight into safety and cost considerations which have to be made when deciding between native and emulated smart contracts.

AB Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This article outlines the benefits and risks of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) for the clearing and settlement of exchange-traded and OTC securities, followed by a description of the technology's potential role for central counterparties and central securities depositories. Although the industry and scholars are attempting to solve the technological and operational issues that DLT systems still face, outstanding legal risks are such that the financial industry is asking for more regulatory guidance and intervention. This article wants to contribute to the public policy debate by presenting potential regulatory barriers that may have to be removed for DLT to be fully adopted. In addition, it identifies areas requiring an update of the legal framework in order to address certain prudential and conduct risks that this technology could introduce.

AB Cryptoassets have emerged as a new category of financial products in recent years and have attracted a great deal of attention from market participants and regulators. While the characteristics of cryptoassets, such as anonymity and disintermediation in transactions, bring significant benefits, they come with a range of significant risks concerning investor protection and market integrity. Due to the difficulties in regulating cryptoassets under the traditional framework, Hong Kong has set up its first comprehensive regulatory regime on cryptoassets in November 2018, imposing new standards on cryptoasset fund managers, distributors and platform operators. By means of a comparison with four major jurisdictions overseas, including Mainland China, the US, the UK, and Singapore, the strengths and potential concerns of Hong Kong's new regime are analysed. Overall, the new regulatory regime for cryptoassets in Hong Kong is a significant development, addressing the issues of regulatory gaps and regulatory arbitrage that existed under the previous framework as well as introducing enhanced regulatory standards. This has the effect of improving investor protection, but there are some remaining concerns. Chief amongst them are the problems with regulatory scope, the application of traditional regulatory standards to cryptoassets that do not fall within the definition of securities or futures, problems with the sandbox mechanism, and ultimately as a matter of regulatory philosophy, the need for a better balance between investor protection and market development.

AB Blockchain is a very promising technology that spans many use cases other than cryptocurrencies. For example, its implementation in the Internet of Things (IoT) based networks is still unclear and demands further research. This is mainly due to the limited constraints of IoT devices and the ledger-based design of blockchain protocol. IoT may offer many benefits if blockchain features can be balanced to fit it. As such, many current problems in IoT can be resolved. However, implementing blockchain for IoT may still impose a variety of challenges. In this paper, we provide a recent literature review analysis on blockchain in IoT. In particular, we identify five key components along with their design considerations and challenges that should be considered while creating blockchain architecture for IoT. We also define gaps that hinder creating a secure blockchain framework for IoT. We simulated two different types of blockchain implementation and identified that device to device architecture has comparatively better throughput than gateway based implementations.

AB Background: Pharmaceutical corruption is a serious challenge in global health. Digital technologies that can detect and prevent fraud and corruption are particularly important to address barriers to access to medicines, such as medicines availability and affordability, stockouts, shortages, diversion, and infiltration of substandard and falsified medicines. Objectives: To better understand how digital technologies are used to combat corruption, increase transparency, and detect fraud in pharmaceutical procurement systems to improve population health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the health/medicine, engineering, and computer science literature. Our search queries included keywords associated with medicines procurement and digital technology in combination with terms associated with transparency and anti-corruption initiatives. Our definition of 'digital technology' focused on Internet-based communications, including online portals and management systems, supply chain tools, and electronic databases. Results: We extracted 37 articles for in-depth review based on our inclusion criteria focused on the utilization of digital technology to improve medicines procurement. The vast majority of articles focused on electronic data transfer and/or e-procurement systems with fewer articles discussing emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain distributed ledger solutions. In the context of e-procurement, slow adoption, justifying cost-savings, and need for technical standards setting were identified as key challenges for current and future utilization. Conclusions: Though there is a significant promise for digital technologies, particularly e-procurement, overall adoption of solutions that can enhance transparency, accountability and concomitantly combat corruption, is still underdeveloped. Future efforts should focus on tying cost-saving measurements with anti-corruption indicators, prioritizing centralization of e-procurement systems, establishing regulatory harmonization with standards setting, and incorporating additional anti-corruption technologies into procurement processes for improving access to medicines and to reach the overall goal of Universal Health Coverage.

AB LoRaWAN, part of the long range Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol that enables communication between the battery operated resource constrained devices. Although LoRaWAN provides system-level security, these networks are based on a basic assumption of trust between the network server and the user, which as a result empowers a network server with undue authorities. Moreover, the nature of the LoRaWAN join procedure, which is a key component for ensuring network operation, is highly susceptible to jamming and replay attacks through slight packet manipulation, thus making the network vulnerable. In order to address these deficiencies, we present a blockchain-based distributed framework for the LoRaWAN join procedure, in order to provide a secure and trusted authentication system within LoRaWAN networks. Our proposed solution eliminates the jamming and replay attack threats against the LoRaWAN join procedure and in addition builds trust among LoRa end devices and network servers. The framework is endorsed by a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation using the Ethereum blockchain which is used to evaluate the proposed system in realistic LoRaWAN network scenarios. The simulations results indicate that the proposed solution achieves efficient system performance up to an upper bound on the load level which involves 30 join requests from 1000 concurrent clients.

AB Traditionally, the energy industry has been slow in adopting new disruptive technologies and the transition to a new energy market will require a new digital transformation plan, involving all parties from the energy market. Although it now seems to be an impossible and hard-to-accept scenario, especially by the big players in the industry, the pilot projects so far demonstrate that blockchain can play a major role in the future energy market, even if the technology is still in the first stages of the adoption life cycle. This article attempts to describe a solution to provide alternative irrigation systems for small farmers. The solution involves creating associations of small farmers that will use green energy from photovoltaic panels for the irrigation of agricultural lands. The efficiency of the proposed system can be monitored not only through digital hardware connected to photovoltaic panels and water pumps, but also by using the new blockchain technology that stimulates innovation and growth in the energy and a high level of automation though smart contracts. To accelerate the transition to the green energy economy, a SolarCoin version similar to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has also been proposed, which is a utility token that creates new possibilities for energy and water trading.

AB The use of digital technologies has been recognized as one of the great challenges for businesses of the 21st century. This digitalization is characterized by the intensive use of information technologies in the different stages of the value chain of a sector. In this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. In this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Blockchain, among others. Second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation. This tool is initially applied to two cases of agri-cooperatives in Spain. All of this contributes to a better understanding of digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the context of smart agriculture.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from various security vulnerabilities. The use of blockchain technology can help resolve these vulnerabilities, but some practical problems in terms of scalability continue to hinder the adaption of blockchain for application in the IoT. The directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Tangle model proposed by the IOTA Foundation aims to avoid transaction fees by employing a different protocol from that used in the blockchain. This model uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to update a distributed ledger. However, concerns about centralization by the coordinator nodes remain. Additionally, the economic incentive to choose the algorithm is insufficient. The present study proposes a light and efficient distributed ledger update algorithm that regards only the subtangle of each step by considering the Bayesian inference. Experimental results have confirmed that the performance of the proposed methodology is similar to that of the existing methodology, and the proposed methodology enables a faster computation time. It also provides the same resistance to possible attacks, and for the same reasons, as does the MCMC algorithm.

TI Anti-Fraud in International Supply Chain Finance: Focusing on Moneual
   Case
SO JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE

DE Due Diligence; Export Financing Facility (EFF); Open Account; Trade
   Finance Fraud; Moneual Case
AB Purpose - This study analyzes the scope of due diligence and risks of banks and K-Sure in trade finance covered by EFF focusing on Moneual case, one of the latest and biggest trade finance fraud cases in Korea. Also, we suggest anti-fraud measures in trade finance on the part of banks and K-Sure in order to give them a desirable way of due diligence and reasonable risk management of export insurance.
   Design/methodology - Based on Moneual case of trade finance fraud, this study employs the methodology of an extended literature review and analysis of court decisions.
   Findings - Seoul High Court of Korea failed to decide whether K-Sure was wholly obliged to pay the insurance against the banks' EFF claims, but issued a compulsory mediation order, judging that both the banks and K-Sure were responsible by 50:50. The court may have judged that both the parties had lacked their due diligence in the trade finance. It is quite difficult for trade finance providers to manually investigate whether the transaction is suspected of trade finance fraud, so digitalization of trade finance which can facilitate the prevention and detection of trade fraud needs to be realized quickly. Since there has been no international rule available for open account trade finance up till now, clearly stipulated EFF terms on the exporter's genuine export obligation might have protected K-Sure from the disaster.
   Originality/value - This study investigates the due diligence of the banks and K-Sure in Moneual case which few researchers have considered, to the best of our knowledge. This study also suggests several practical methods (including block chain) to prevent complicating trade finance fraud amid increasing use of an open account, and further offers reasonable risk management of EFF employing international factoring rule which is also related to problematic open account trade finance.

TI Location-Aware Wi-Fi Authentication Scheme Using Smart Contract

AB Advanced wireless technology in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing and facing various security threats. The authentication of IoT devices is the first line of defense for the wireless network. Especially in a Wi-Fi network, the existing authentication methods mainly use a password or digital certificate, these methods are inconvenient to manage due to certificate issuance or prone to be attacked because passwords are easily cracked. In this paper, we propose a location-aware authentication scheme using smart contracts to ensure that IoT devices can securely perform Wi-Fi network authentication. The scheme adopts the concept of secondary authentication and consists of two phases: the registration phase, which is mainly designed to complete the generation of the public and private keys, and to link the device information with its related device information; the authentication phase, which is mainly designed to determine whether the requesting device is within a legal location range. We use the smart contract to ensure the credibility and irreparability of the authentication process. Analysis of the attack model and the attacks at different stages proves that this certification scheme is assured, and the simulation results show that the overhead introduced by this scheme is acceptable, this scheme can provide greater security for the Wi-Fi authentication of IoT devices.

AB The trustworthiness of data is vital data analysis in the age of big data. In cyber-physical systems, most data is collected by sensors. With the increase of sensors as Internet of Things (IoT) nodes in the network, the security risk of data tampering, unauthorized access, false identify, and others are overgrowing because of vulnerable nodes, which leads to the great economic and social loss. This paper proposes a security scheme, Securing Nodes in IoT Perception Layer (SNPL), for protecting nodes in the perception layer. The SNPL is constructed by novel lightweight algorithms to ensure security and satisfy performance requirements, as well as safety technologies to provide security isolation for sensitive operations. A series of experiments with different types and numbers of nodes are presented. Experimental results and performance analysis show that SNPL is efficient and effective at protecting IoT from faulty or malicious nodes. Some potential practical application scenarios are also discussed to motivate the implementation of the proposed scheme in the real world.

AB With the gradual popularization of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and the development of wireless networking technologies, the use of heterogeneous devices and runtime verification of task fulfillment with different constraints are required in real-world IoT scenarios. As far as IoT systems are concerned, most of them are built on centralized architectures, which reveal various assailable points in data security and privacy threats. Hence, this paper aims to investigate these issues by delegating the responsibility of a verification monitor from a centralized architecture to a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. We present a smart contract-based task management scheme to provide runtime verification of device behaviors and allows trustworthy access control to these devices. The business logic of the proposed system is specified by the smart contract, which automates all time-consuming processes cryptographically and correctly. The usability of the proposed solution is further demonstrated by implementing a prototype application in which the Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to implement the business logic for runtime verification and access control with one desktop and one Raspberry Pi. A comprehensive evaluation experiment is conducted, and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.

ID DATA-INJECTION ATTACKS; MANAGEMENT
AB In order to ensure the information security, most of the important information including the data of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the energy internet is currently transmitted and exchanged through the intranet or the carrier communication. The former increases the cost of network construction, and the latter is susceptible to interference and attacks in the process of information dissemination. The blockchain is an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm. Under the premise that these nodes do not need mutual trust, the blockchain can implement trusted peer-to-peer communication for protecting the important information by adopting distributed consensus mechanisms, encryption algorithms, point-to-point transmission and smart contracts. In response to the above issues, this paper firstly analyzes the information security problems existing in the energy internet from the four perspectives of system control layer, device access, market transaction and user privacy. Then blockchain technology is introduced, and its working principles and technical characteristics are analyzed. Based on the technical characteristics, we propose the multilevel and multichain information transmission model for the weak centralization of scheduling and the decentralization of transaction. Furthermore, we discuss that the information transmission model helps solve some of the information security issues from the four perspectives of system control, device access, market transaction and user privacy. Application examples are used to illustrate the technical features that benefited from the blockchain for the information security of the energy internet.

AB The copyright of data is a key point that needs to be solved in spatial data infrastructure for data sharing. In this paper, we propose a decentralized digital rights management model of spatial data, which can provide a novel way of solving the existing copyright management problem or other problems in spatial data infrastructure for data sharing. An Ethereum smart contract is used in this model to realize spatial data digital rights management function. The InterPlanetary File System is utilized as external data storage for storing spatial data in the decentralized file system to avoid data destruction that is caused by a single point of failure. There is no central server in the model architecture, which has a completely decentralized nature and it makes spatial data rights management not dependent on third-party trust institutions. We designed three spatial data copyright management algorithms, developed a prototype system to implement and test the model, used the smart contract security verification tool to check code vulnerabilities, and, finally, discussed the usability, scalability, efficiency, performance, and security of the proposed model. The result indicates that the proposed model not only has diversified functions of copyright management compared with previous studies on the blockchain-based digital rights management, but it can also solve the existing problems in traditional spatial data infrastructure for data sharing due to its characteristics of complete decentralization, mass orientation, immediacy, and high security.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain technologies are rapidly being developed and tested in a broad range of business and governmental settings. Their unique cryptographic characteristics and configurations enable users of these systems to transact directly and anonymously. The data these users generate are timestamped and immutable. In open blockhains, individual users take responsibility for managing and protecting their own data and for ensuring the reliability of the parties with whom they transact. The socio-material characteristics of these systems will influence user attitudes and behaviors in ways that are profound and difficult to predict. Outcomes have not yet been researched, and the academy has adopted a stance of technological determinism despite the fact that implicit assumptions about outcomes are literally coded in as these systems are developed. We envision potential impacts that may result from self-sovereign ownership of data including: commoditization of the self and relationships with others, the need to police personal data and reputation, and new perceptions of time and history that result from transaction sequentialization and permanence. Further research on the societal impacts of blockchain technologies is needed as these systems become ubiquitous.

AB Increasingly, governments around the world, particularly in technologically advanced countries, are exploring or implementing smart homes, or the related smart facilities for the benefits of the society. The capability to remotely access and control Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., capturing of images, audios, and other information) is convenient but risky, as vulnerable devices can be exploited to conduct surveillance or perform other nefarious activities on the users and organizations. This highlights the necessity of designing a secure and efficient remote user authentication solution. Most of the existing solutions for this problem are generally based on a single-server architecture, which has limitations in terms of privacy and anonymity (leading to users' daily activities being predicted), and integrity and confidentiality (resulting in an unreliable behavior auditing). While blockchain-based solutions may mitigate these issues, they still face some critical challenges (e.g., providing regulation of behaviors and privacy protection of access policy). Motivated by these facts, in this article, we construct a novel secure mutual authentication system, which can be applied in smart homes and other applications. Specifically, the proposed approach integrates blockchain, group signature, and message authentication code to provide reliable auditing of users' access history, anonymously authenticate group members, and efficiently authenticate home gateway, respectively. We also prove the security and privacy requirements, including anonymity, traceability, and confidentiality, that the proposed system satisfies, with an implementation and evaluation to demonstrate its practicality.

AB Cloud storage offers convenient outsourcing services to users, and it serves as a basic platform to drive Internet-of-Things (IoT) where massive devices are connected to the cloud storage and interact with each other. However, cloud storage is more than a data warehouse. In the literature, data market was proposed as a novel model to empower IoT, where data are circulated as merchandise in the digital marketplace with financial activities. When storing IoT data in cloud storage, security and efficiency rules should be applied. Meanwhile, data dynamics is counted as a critical factor to the feasibility of datamarket as data are supposed to be manipulated through circulation and exploitation for IoT. Another issue is the single-point-of-failure (SPoF) of cloud server in which the initiative of jointcloud was suggested. Since providing data security, efficiency, and dynamics simultaneously is challenging, in this article, we propose a versatile auditing scheme (EVA) as a solution to problems. Our proposal ensures that data are securely, efficiently, and dynamically stored in the jointcloud meanwhile supported by data trades via blockchain. We give a comprehensive security analysis based on our security definitions and experiments to support our claims. The evidence has shown that our EVA is efficient for processing large files when proper parameters are chosen.

ID SECURITY
AB The role of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructure sectors, such as power, chemistry, and manufacturing, will be increasingly important as we move toward Industry 5.0. For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.

AB To improve mobile users' quality-of-experience (QoE) in the mobile cyber-physical system (MCPS), caching layered-coding contents on edge nodes that are close to mobile users has been advocated as a promising solution, which can efficiently lower the content delivery delay and mitigate the overhead of backhaul network. However, due to the complexity of trust management and the limited caching capacities of edge nodes, designing an efficient edge caching scheme for mobile users becomes a challenge. Meanwhile, the content caching in MCPS also faces some security problems, where edge nodes may return incorrect results or viruses to mobile users, and mobile users would deliberately refuse to pay for caching services. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based trustworthy edge caching scheme for mobile users in MCPS. Specifically, we first exploit blockchain to supervise the caching transactions between the edge nodes and mobile users in a distributed manner, whereby the caching service information cannot be modified and denied by any entities. Furthermore, we devise a trust management mechanism for mobile users to search the trustworthy caching services from diversified edge nodes, where the trust degree of the edge node is real-time evaluated and updated by mobile users based on the quality of caching service. To take full advantage of caching resources, we design a max-min-based resource allocation algorithm, with which the trustworthy edge node could fairly allocate its caching resource based on mobile users' optimal demands. The simulation results show that the presented scheme not only improves the utilities of edge nodes but also increases the QoE of mobile users.

AB With the widespread applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), e.g., smart city, business, healthcare, etc., the security of data and devices becomes a major concern. Although blockchain can effectively enhance the network security and achieve fault tolerance, the huge resource consumption and limited performance of data processing restrict its deployments in IoT scenarios. Observing the heterogeneity and resource constraints, we intend to make blockchain accommodate both wimpy and brawny IoT devices. In this article, we present Tornado, a high-performance blockchain system based on space-structured ledger and corresponding algorithms, to enable blockchain in IoT. Specifically, we first design a space-structured chain architecture with novel data structures for promoting the network scalability. To address the huge heterogeneity of IoT, a novel consensus mechanism named collaborative-proof of work is developed. Moreover, we propose the space-structured greedy heaviest-observed subtree (S(2)GHOST) protocol for improving the resource efficiency of IoT devices. Additionally, a dynamic weight assignment mechanism in S(2)GHOST contributes to reflect the trustworthiness of data and devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tornado can achieve a maximum throughput of 3464.76 transactions per second. The optimizations of propagation latency and resource efficiency are 68.14% and 30.56%, respectively.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) makes our life more intelligent. Its combination with the cloud server can solve big data processing problems to meet users' needs and bring us great convenience. However, there are two challenges we need to face: data sharing and key leakage. To solve the above challenges, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is used to achieve data sharing combined with searchable encryption (SE). Most of the existing attribute-based searchable encryption (SE) schemes are inefficient and not suitable for IoT devices because of the large amount of attributes and keys. The key-leakage problem is serious in practice which very little literature focused on it. In order to address both problems, in this article, we propose a key aggregation searchable encryption (KASE) scheme based on the blockchain with auxiliary input (AI), which is capable of achieving secure data sharing on the encrypted data. Our scheme is presented through a novel chosen plaintext attack (CPA) secure scheme. We prove our scheme is chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) secure against key leakage under the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption and Goldreich-Leivin theorem. Moreover, we adopt the proposed scheme to establish a data-sharing system based on blockchain, which improves search efficiency and connects the global ecology. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are conducted, and the results indicate our scheme is really efficient in cloud-computing-enhanced IoT.

AB Smart cameras and image sensors are widely used in industrial processes, from the designing to the quality checking of the final product. Images generated by these sensors are at continuous risk of disclosure and privacy breach in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Traditional solutions to secure sensitive data fade in IIoT environments because of the involvement of third parties. Blockchain technology is the modern-day solution for trust issues and eliminating or minimizing the role of the third party. In the context of the IIoT, we propose a permissioned private blockchain-based solution to secure the image while encrypting it. In this scheme, the cryptographic pixel values of an image are stored on the blockchain, ensuring the privacy and security of the image data. Based on the number of pixels change rate (NPCR), the unified averaged changed intensity (UACI), and information entropy analysis, we evaluate the strength of proposed image encryption algorithm ciphers with respect to differential attacks. We obtained entropy values near to an ideal value of 8, which is considered to be safe from brute force attack. Encrypted results show that the proposed scheme is highly effective for data leakage prevention and security.

AB The International Energy Agency has projected that the total energy demand for electricity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to rise by an average of 4% per year up to 2040. It implies that similar to 620 million people are living without electricity in SSA. Going with the 2030 vision of the United Nations that electricity should be accessible to all, it is important that new technology and methods are provided. In comparison to other nations worldwide, smart grid (SG) is an emerging technology in SSA. SG is an information technology-enhanced power grid, which provides a two-way communication network between energy producers and customers. Also, it includes renewable energy, smart meters, and smart devices that help to manage energy demands and reduce energy generation costs. However, SG is facing inherent difficulties, such as energy theft, lack of trust, security, and privacy issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized energy system (BDES) to accelerate rural and urban electrification by improving service delivery while minimizing the cost of generation and addressing historical antipathy and cybersecurity risk within SSA. Additionally, energy insufficiency and fixed pricing schemes may raise concerns in SG, such as the imbalance of order. The paper also introduces a blockchain-based energy trading system, which includes price negotiation and incentive mechanisms to address the imbalance of order. Moreover, existing models for energy planning do not consider the effect of fill rate (FR) and service level (SL). A blockchain levelized cost of energy (BLCOE) is proposed as the least-cost solution that measures the impact of energy reliability on generation cost using FR and SL. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed model and the least-cost option varies with relative energy generation cost of centralized, decentralized and BDES infrastructure. Case studies of Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Liberia, Mali, and Senegal illustrate situations that are more suitable for BDES. For other SSA countries, BDES can cost-effectively service a large population and regions. Additionally, BLCOE reduces energy costs by approximately 95% for battery and 75% for the solar modules. The future BLCOE varies across SSA on an average of about 0.049 $/kWh as compared to 0.15 $/kWh of an existing system in the literature.

AB Smart contracts have gained a lot of popularity in recent times as they are a very powerful tool for the development of decentralised and automatic applications in many fields without the need for intermediaries or trusted third parties. However, due to the decentralised nature of the blockchain on which they are based, a series of challenges have emerged related to vulnerabilities in their programming that, given their particularities, could have (and have already had) a very high economic impact. This article provides a holistic view of security challenges associated with smart contracts, as well as the state of the art of available public domain tools.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB With the advent of 5G, the industrial Internet of Things has developed rapidly. The industrial sensor-cloud system (SCS) has also received widespread attention. In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS.

AB In the current centralized IoT ecosystems, all financial transactions are routed through IoT platform providers. The security and privacy issues are inevitable with an untrusted or compromised IoT platform provider. To address these issues, we propose Hy-Bridge, a hybrid blockchain-based billing and charging framework. In Hy-Bridge, the IoT platform provider plays no proxy role, and IoT users can securely and efficiently share a credit with other users. The trustful end-to-end functionality of blockchain helps us to provide accountability and reliability features in IoT transactions. Furthermore, with the blockchain-distributed consensus, we provide a credit-sharing feature for IoT users in the energy and utility market. To provide this feature, we introduce a local block framework for service management in the credit-sharing group. To preserve the IoT users' privacy and avoid any information leakage to the main blockchain, an interconnection position, called bridge, is introduced to isolate IoT users' peer-to-peer transactions and link the main blockchain to its subnetwork blockchain(s) in a hybrid model. To this end, a k-anonymity protection is performed on the bridge. To evaluate the performance of the introduced hybrid blockchain-based billing and charging, we simulated the energy use case scenario using Hy-Bridge. Our simulation results show that Hy-Bridge could protect user privacy with an acceptable level of information loss and CPU and memory usage.

ID CHALLENGES
AB A disruptive technology often used in finance, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare, blockchain can reach consensus within a decentralised network-potentially composed of large amounts of unreliable nodes-and to permanently and irreversibly store data in a tamper-proof manner. In this paper, we present a reputation system for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It considers the users interested in traffic information as the main actors of the architecture. They securely share their data which are collectively validated by other users. Users can choose to employ either such crowd-sourced validated data or data generated by the system to travel between two locations. The data saved is reliable, based on the providers' reputation and cannot be modified. We present results with a simulation for three cities: San Francisco, Rome and Beijing. We have demonstrated the impact of malicious attacks as the average speed decreased if erroneous information was stored in the blockchain as an implemented routing algorithm guides the honest cars on other free routes, and thus crowds other intersections.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of IoT devices has increased exponentially. Therefore, we have put forward higher security requirements for the management, transmission, and storage of massive IoT data. However, during the transmission process of IoT data, security issues, such as data theft and forgery, are prone to occur. In addition, most existing data storage solutions are centralized, i.e., data are stored and maintained by a centralized server. Once the server is maliciously attacked, the security of IoT data will be greatly threatened. In view of the above-mentioned security issues, a security transmission and storage solution is proposed about sensing image for blockchain in the IoT. Firstly, this solution intelligently senses user image information, and divides these sensed data into intelligent blocks. Secondly, different blocks of data are encrypted and transmitted securely through intelligent encryption algorithms. Finally, signature verification and storage are performed through an intelligent verification algorithm. Compared with the traditional IoT data transmission and centralized storage solution, our solution combines the IoT with the blockchain, making use of the advantages of blockchain decentralization, high reliability, and low cost to transfer and store users image information securely. Security analysis proves that the solution can resist theft attacks and ensure the security of user image information during transmission and storage.

TI Blockchain-Based Lightweight Trust Management in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks

DT Article
DE blockchain; distributed trust; mobile ad-hoc network (MANET); optimized
   link state routing protocol (OLSR)
AB As a trending and interesting research topic, in recent years, researchers have been adopting the blockchain in the wireless ad-hoc environment. Owing to its strong characteristics, such as consensus, immutability, finality, and provenance, the blockchain is utilized not only as a secure data storage for critical data but also as a platform that facilitates the trustless exchange of data between independent parties. However, the main challenge of blockchain application in an ad-hoc network is which kind of nodes should be involved in the validation process and how to adopt the heavy computational complexity of block validation appropriately while maintaining the genuine characteristics of a blockchain. In this paper, we propose the blockchain-based trust management system with a lightweight consensus algorithm in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). The proposed scheme provides the distributed trust framework for routing nodes in MANETs that is tamper-proof via blockchain. The optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR) is exploited as a representative protocol to embed the blockchain concept in MANETs. As a securely distributed and trusted platform, blockchain solves most of the security issues in the OLSR, in which every node is performing the security operation individually and in a repetitive manner. Additionally, using predefined principles, the routing nodes in the proposed scheme can collaborate to defend themselves from the attackers in the network. The experimental results show that the proposed consensus algorithm is suitable to be used in the resource-hungry MANET with reduced validation time and less overhead. Meanwhile, the attack detection overhead and time also decrease because the repetitivity of the process is reduced while providing a scalable and distributed trust among the routing nodes.

AB Smart grid systems have become popular and necessary for the development of a sustainable power grid. These systems use different technologies to provide optimized services to the users of the network. Regarding computing, these systems optimize electrical services by processing a large amount of the data generated. However, privacy and security are essential in this kind of system. With a large amount of data generated, it is necessary to protect the privacy of users, because this data may reveal the users' personal information. Today, blockchain technology has proven to be an efficient architecture for solving privacy and security problems in different scenarios. Over the years, different blockchain platforms have emerged, attempting to solve specific problems in different areas. However, the use of different platforms fragmented the market, which was no different in the smart grid scenario. This work proposes a blockchain architecture that uses sidechains to make the system scalable and adaptable. We used three blockchains to ensure privacy, security, and trust in the system. To universalize the proposed solution, we used the Open Smart Grid Protocol and smart contracts. The results show that architecture security and privacy are guaranteed, making it feasible for implementation in real systems; although scalability issues regarding the storage of the data generated still exist.

AB Industrial IoT has special communication requirements, including high reliability, low latency, flexibility, and security. These are instinctively provided by the 5G mobile technology, making it a successful candidate for supporting Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. The aim of this paper is to identify current research challenges and solutions in relation to 5G-enabled Industrial IoT, based on the initial requirements and promises of both domains. The methodology of the paper follows the steps of surveying state-of-the art, comparing results to identify further challenges, and drawing conclusions as lessons learned for each research domain. These areas include IIoT applications and their requirements; mobile edge cloud; back-end performance tuning; network function virtualization; and security, blockchains for IIoT, Artificial Intelligence support for 5G, and private campus networks. Beside surveying the current challenges and solutions, the paper aims to provide meaningful comparisons for each of these areas (in relation to 5G-enabled IIoT) to draw conclusions on current research gaps.

AB With the rapid increase in urbanisation, the concept of smart cities has attracted considerable attention. By leveraging emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and cloud computing, smart cities have the potential to improve various indicators of residents' quality of life. However, threats to data integrity may affect the delivery of such benefits, especially in the IoT environment where most devices are inherently dynamic and have limited resources. Prior work has focused on ensuring integrity of data in a piecemeal manner and covering only some parts of the smart city ecosystem. In this paper, we address integrity of data from an end-to-end perspective, i.e., from the data source to the data consumer. We propose a holistic framework for ensuring integrity of data in smart cities that covers the entire data lifecycle. Our framework is founded on three fundamental concepts, namely, secret sharing, fog computing and blockchain. We provide a detailed description of various components of the framework and also utilize smart healthcare as use case.

TI Cybersecurity threat intelligence knowledge exchange based on blockchain
   Proposal of a new incentive model based on blockchain and Smart
   contracts to foster the cyber threat and risk intelligence exchange of
   information

AB Although cyber threat intelligence (CTI) exchange is a theoretically useful technique for improving security of a society, the potential participants are often reluctant to share their CTI and prefer to consume only, at least in voluntary based approaches. Such behavior destroys the idea of information exchange. On the other hand, governments are forcing specific entities and operators to report them specific incidents depending on their impact, otherwise there could be sanctions to those operators which are not reporting them on time. Obligations and sanctions are usually discouraging participants to share information voluntarily which will just share and report what is strictly required. We propose a paradigm shift of cybersecurity information exchange by introducing a new way to encourage all participants involved, at all levels, to share relevant information dynamically. It will also contribute to the support and deployment of Dynamic Risk Management frameworks to keep risks under an acceptance level along the time. Participants will have new and specific incentives to share, invest and consume threat intelligence and risk intelligence information depending on their different roles (producers, consumers, investors, donors and owner). Our proposal leverages from standards like Structured Threat Information Exchange, as well as W3C semantic web standards to enable a workspace of knowledge related to behavioral threat intelligence patterning to characterize tactics, techniques and procedures. At the same time, we propose an Ethereum Blockchain Smart contract Marketplace to better incentivize the sharing of that knowledge between all parties involved as well as creating a standard CTI token as a digital asset with a promising value in the market. Simulations and an experimentation were performed to demonstrate its benefits and incentives, but also its potential limits with regard to storage and cost of transactions.

AB While enjoying the convenience brought by Location Based Service (LBS), the location privacy of vehicles in VANET may be disclosed. Distributed k-anonymity, as one of the most popular privacy protection methods, fails to take the trustworthiness of participants into account, resulting in malicious tracing of vehicles, which further leads to the sensitive information leakage, and even the safety threat of personal property. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain enabled trust-based location privacy protection scheme in VANET. Specifically, by analyzing the different requirements of the request vehicle and the cooperative vehicle during the process of constructing the anonymous cloaking region, as well as combining the characteristics of these two roles, we devise the trust management method based on Dirichlet distribution, such that both the requester and the cooperator will only cooperate with the vehicles they trust. Moreover, by employing blockchain, we also proposed the data structure to record the trustworthiness of vehicles on publicly available blocks timely, so that any vehicle can access the historical trust information of counterparties whenever necessary. Finally, the construction process of anonymous cloaking region is presented. Security analysis and extensive experiments indicate that the proposal is resilient to various trust model attacks, it can effectively detect the malicious vehicles, and preserve the location privacy of vehicles in the anonymous cloaking region construction, while the required time delay is limited.

AB Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is composed of multiple distributed vehicular clouds (VCs), which are formed on-the-fly by dynamically integrating underutilized vehicular resources including computing power, storage, and so on. Existing proposals for identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) are not suitable for use in VCC due to limited computing resources and storage capacity of onboard vehicle devices. In this paper, we first propose an improved ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme. Utilizing the improved CP-ABE scheme and the permissioned blockchain technology, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving IDaaS architecture for VCC named IDaaSoVCC. It realizes lightweight and privacy-preserving access control of vehicles' personally identifiable information (PII) in a large distributed vehicular cloud system. Security analysis demonstrates the security features of IDaaSoVCC, most notably forward secrecy, confidentiality and identity information privacy. Meanwhile, we verify that IDaaSoVCC is feasible and practical in a large distributed VC system through extensive simulations.

AB Access control has become problematic in several organizations because of the difficulty in establishing security and preventing malicious users from mimicking roles. Moreover, there is no flexibility among users in the participation in their roles, and even controlling them. Several role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms have been proposed to alleviate these problems, but the security has not been fully realized. In this work, however, we present an RBAC model based on blockchain technology to enhance user authentication before knowledge is accessed and utilized in a knowledge management system (KMS). Our blockchain-based system model and the smart contract ensure that transparency and knowledge resource immutability are achieved. We also present smart contract algorithms and discussions about the model. As an essential part of RBAC model applied to KMS environment, trust is ensured in the network. Evaluation results show that our system is efficient.

   post-blockchain; REA; Sensorica
AB Open innovation is a concept in flux; from the practice of large-scale, internet-mediated collaboration, to a strategic option and business model for firms. However, the scope and breadth of its transformative dynamic is arguably restrained. Despite the theoretical and empirical benefits of openness, established firms face significant challenges deploying the coordination patterns of open innovation communities, further reducing the potential of spill-overs in the supply chain. Viewed differently, open innovation presents more user-centric and responsible innovation paths. These are manifested in the processes and outputs of open innovation by empowering participation and by successfully employing the capacities of user communities. To reap the benefits of open innovation, a rapid reconfiguration of the production and exchange structures is needed in intrafirm and interfirm relations. Sensorica is an open enterprise that achieves such forms of organization and a unique techno-social infrastructure supporting them. It illustrates a potential path that can realize the full potential of open innovation, for users, firms, and the economic system as a whole.

TI k-Root-n: An Efficient Algorithm for Avoiding Short Term Double-Spending
   Alongside Distributed Ledger Technologies such as Blockchain
SO INFORMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE blockchain; bitcoin; cryptocurrency; distributed ledger technology
AB Blockchains such as the bitcoin blockchain depend on reaching a global consensus on the distributed ledger; therefore, they suffer from well-known scalability problems. This paper proposes an algorithm that avoids double-spending in the short term with just O(root n) messages instead of O(n); each node receiving money off-chain performs the due diligence of consulting k root n random nodes to check if any of them is aware of double-spending. Two nodes receiving double-spent money will in this way consult at least one common node with very high probability, because of the 'birthday paradox', and any common honest node consulted will detect the fraud. Since the velocity of money in the real world has coins circulating through at most a few wallets per day, the size of the due diligence communication is small in the short term. This 'k-root-n' algorithm is suitable for an environment with synchronous or asynchronous (but with fairly low latency) communication and with Byzantine faults. The presented k-root-n algorithm should be practical to avoid double-spending with arbitrarily high probability, while feasibly coping with the throughput of all world commerce. It is resistant to Sybil attacks even beyond 50% of nodes. In the long term, the k-root-n algorithm is less efficient. Therefore, it should preferably be used as a complement, and not a replacement, to a global distributed ledger technology.

AB Blockchain has been used primarily in cryptocurrency applications like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These use cases show the staying power of blockchain technology and suggest additional uses such as smart contracting. We suggest these use cases, while producing knowledge, do not forecast the future of blockchain. Learning-by-doing reveals the evolution of blockchain as a sociotechnical system, suggesting that there is more to learn. Predicting how sociotechnical systems will evolve is difficult, but historical and lexical analyses suggest two areas for blockchain growth. One is provenance, authentication through recording of ownership or other control state, applicable to jewels, real property, art works, food stuffs, designer items, and anything else where genuineness is valued. The other is chain-of-custody, proving that duty of care has been faithfully executed regarding living beings (children, people in legal custody, research subjects, research animals, pets), or that inanimate things (evidence, data, representations such as photographs) have not been tampered with.

   Social Media; Decentralized Online Social Networks
AB Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become one of the most popular application of the daily life of users in the worldwide. Today the number of Social Media users is about 3 billion, and this trend increases year per year with high impact on the privacy issue. During the last years, decentralization of social services has been considered a big opportunity to overcome the main issues in OSNs. Blockchain technology represents today the most well known decentralized technique, which has been taken into account to develop the new generation of decentralized social platforms. Nevertheless, the real benefit of the introduction of blockchain technology in real social platforms is still unknown. In this paper we propose an overview of the main Blockchain-based Online Social Media platforms. We describe in detail these platforms by highlighting the main features and services they offer, but also the common drawbacks of these platforms. Finally, we propose a new model of Blockchain-based Online Social Network, which takes into account the role of the user as the center of the system, instead of the role of the content as in current proposals.

AB In the era of cloud computing and Industry 4.0, significant research efforts on cloud manufacturing have been witnessed in recent years. Nevertheless, challenges, such as issues of trust, safety, payment, remain in this emerging area, which cause less confidence for industry to adopt cloud manufacturing. In this regard, the recent development of blockchain technology provides a potential viable solution thanks to its unique advantages in decentralization and security. As such, we propose a new framework of cloud manufacturing by integrating the blockchain technology. In essence, consensus-oriented mechanisms are employed to generate the operating standards for the blockchain cloud manufacturing model. Moreover, based on the open source Ethereum code, we construct a simulation case study for 3D printing services using the proposed framework. A consortium or federated blockchain is simulated which uses Proof-of-Authority (PoA) as the consensus algorithm of block generation. The simulation involves 939 job requests from 100 users, as well as 10 service providers. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed to recommend the service provider for each request. The results show that the provider's score of service evaluation tends to be stabilize, and 934 requests for service are successfully fulfilled by the appropriate providers while the remaining 5 requests fail to be serviced.

AB Chemical educators are facing a new generation of instructional technologies that impact classroom teaching. New technologies, like smartphones, cloud computing and artificial intelligence take learning beyond the classroom; 3D printing, virtual reality, and augmented reality provide new ways to teach the virtualization skills that are important for chemists. These technologies cause students to become more isolated, so students may not develop the social skills that they will need for today's workplace. Individualized learning may be beneficial to many students, but it will create challenges for faculty. Although this article focuses on chemistry education, it should be apparent that a similar argument could be made for other sciences, like physics and biology.

AB Enterprise blockchain solutions attempt to solve the crucial matter of user privacy, albeit that blockchain was initially directed towards full transparency. In the context of Know Your Customer (KYC) standardization, a decentralized schema that enables user privacy protection on enterprise blockchains is proposed with two types of developed smart contracts. Through the public KYC smart contract, a user registers and uploads their KYC information to the exploited IPFS storage, actions interpreted in blockchain transactions on the permissioned blockchain of Alastria Network. Furthermore, through the public KYC smart contract, an admin user approves or rejects the validity and expiration date of the initial user's KYC documents. Inside the private KYC smart contract, CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) operations for the KYC file repository occur. The presented system introduces effectiveness and time efficiency of operations through its schema simplicity and smart integration of the different technology modules and components. This developed scheme focuses on blockchain technology as the most important and critical part of the architecture and tends to accomplish an optimal schema clarity.

In this sense, this paper presents and discusses state-of-the-art transportation technologies and systems, highlighting the advances that the concepts of Internet of Things and Value are providing. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, are been extensively investigated by the industry, however, its widespread adoption in cities is still desirable. Aligned with operations research opportunities, this paper identifies different points in which cities' services could move to. This also study comments about different combinatorial optimization problems that might be useful and important for an efficient evolution of our cities. By considering different perspectives, didactic examples are presented with a main focus on motivating decision makers to balance citizens, investors and industry goals and wishes.

AB Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are the cornerstone for the security of the communication layer of online services relying on certificate-based authentication, such as e-commerce, e-government, online banking, cloud services, and many others. A PKI is an infrastructure based on a hierarchical model, but the use of PKIs in non-hierarchical contexts has exposed them to many types of attacks. Here, we discuss weaknesses exploited in past attacks and we propose a solution based on an original consensus algorithm developed for use on blockchain technology. In this implementation we retain the full functionality around X.509 certificates, i.e., for the triad (server name, server address, X.509 server certificate), and demonstrate a mechanism for obtaining fast consensus. The main properties of the solution are that a consensus may be reached even when not all members of the involved PKI participate in a transaction, and that no advanced trust agreement among PKIs is needed. The proposed solution is able to detect PKI attacks and can distinguish errors from attacks, allowing precise management of anomalies.

AB By allocating tasks to participants, crowdsensing has shown large potential in addressing large-scale data sensing problems. Considering the problem of unfair payment, negative work of participants, and cooperative cheating, how to assess data quality of tasks reliably is an important problem in crowdsensing. Therefore, a lightweight blockchain-based model for data quality assessment is proposed in this article. First, there are two data quality assessment processes in the model. One is implemented in the selection of participants and the other is implemented in data quality assessment. Second, consensus mechanism and smart contracts are redesigned to be suitable for crowdsensing. The lightweight consensus mechanism delegated proof of reputation (DPoR) is proposed in the blockchain-based model instead of proof of work (PoW). Furthermore, three smart contracts, verifiers selection contract (VSC), participants employment contract (PEC), and data verify contract (DVC), are generated to constrain the behaviors of the involved parties. Finally, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with multiverifiers is proposed to evaluate the performance of task participants. Experiments on the open data sets Wine Quality show that our new method outperforms the existing methods in improving the quality of sensing task.

TI A Blockchain-Based Reward Mechanism for Mobile Crowdsensing

   market; Stackelberg game
ID INTERNET; SELECTION
AB Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a novel sensing scenario of cyber-physical-social systems. MCS has been widely adopted in smart cities, personal health care, and environment monitor areas. MCS applications recruit participants to obtain sensory data from the target area by allocating reward to them. Reward mechanisms are crucial in stimulating participants to join and provide sensory data. However, while the MCS applications execute the reward mechanisms, sensory data and personal private information can be in great danger because of malicious task initiators/participants and hackers. This article proposes a novel blockchain-based MCS framework that preserves privacy and secures both the sensing process and the incentive mechanism by leveraging the emergent blockchain technology. Moreover, to provide a fair incentive mechanism, this article has considered an MCS scenario as a sensory data market, where the market separates the participants into two categories: monthly-pay participants and instant-pay participants. By analyzing two different kinds of participants and the task initiator, this article proposes an incentive mechanism aided by a three-stage Stackelberg game. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, the evaluation addresses two aspects: the reward mechanism and the performance of the blockchain-based MCS. The proposed reward mechanism achieves up to a 10% improvement of the task initiator's utility compared with a traditional Stackelberg game. It can also maintain the required market share for monthly-pay participants while achieving sustainable sensory data provision. The evaluation of the blockchain-based MCS shows that the latency increases in a tolerable manner as the number of participants grows. Finally, this article discusses the future challenges of blockchain-based MCS.

AB In today's era of big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence have formed the backbone for cryptocurrency portfolio optimization. Researchers have investigated various state of the art machine learning models to predict Bitcoin price and volatility. Machine learning models like recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been shown to perform better than traditional time series models in cryptocurrency price prediction. However, very few studies have applied sequence models with robust feature engineering to predict future pricing. In this study, we investigate a framework with a set of advanced machine learning forecasting methods with a fixed set of exogenous and endogenous factors to predict daily Bitcoin prices. We study and compare different approaches using the root mean squared error (RMSE). Experimental results show that the gated recurring unit (GRU) model with recurrent dropout performs better than popular existing models. We also show that simple trading strategies, when implemented with our proposed GRU model and with proper learning, can lead to financial gain.

AB A growing number of households benefit from government subsidies to install renewable generation facilities such as PV panels, used to gain independence from the grid and provide cheap energy. In the Romanian electricity market, these prosumers can sell their generation surplus only at regulated prices, back to the grid. A way to increase the number of prosumers is to allow them to make higher profit by selling this surplus back into the local network. This would also be an advantage for the consumers, who could pay less for electricity exempt from network tariffs and benefit from lower prices resulting from the competition between prosumers. One way of enabling this type of trade is to use peer-to-peer contracts traded in local markets, run at microgrid (mu G) level. This paper presents a new trading platform based on smart peer-to-peer (P2P) contracts for prosumers energy surplus trading in a real local microgrid. Several trading scenarios are proposed, which give the possibility to perform trading based on participants' locations, instantaneous active power demand, maximum daily energy demand, and the principle of first come first served implemented in an anonymous blockchain trading ledger. The developed scheme is tested on a low-voltage (LV) microgrid model to check its feasibility of deployment in a real network. A comparative analysis between the proposed scenarios, regarding traded quatities and financial benefits is performed.

AB Blockchain has the potential to render the transaction of information more secure and transparent. Nowadays, transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous mediums, from paper collected data to smartphone. Most of this data are stored in central servers that are susceptible to hacks. In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources, share the mobility data with unwanted third parties. A multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security, management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency, auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart mobility data-market. In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically-separated devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message interception attacks and providing information access management control.

AB IoT Environment is a recent development in communication networks that supports a wide range of individual and cooperative user applications. Due to the openness of the service providing network, communication services are exposed to malicious risks. In this manuscript, a role-based reputed access control (RRAC) method is designed to mitigate malicious attacks in IoT environments. The RRAC operates in two categories: providing an adaptive certificate authentication internally and trusted user communication externally. The internal security method is responsible for authenticating communication between users and resources. The external security feature aids secure service discovery and user selection for discovering services. The integrated security methods mitigate the influence of malicious users and forged resources in the network, improving communication reliability. The access control decides the availability and usability of the devices to participate in service communications either as a neighbor or as a resource. Experimental results show that the proposed RRAC improves the performance of IoT device communication by achieving higher detection and minimizing detection time, service overhead and loss, false positive rate and misdetection.

AB After smart grid, Internet of Energy (IoE) has emerged as a popular technology in the energy sector by integrating different forms of energy. IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions. Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions, demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of blockchain in the IoE field. This article is build on the literature research and it provides insight to the end-user regarding the future IoE scenario in the context of blockchain technology. Lastly this article discusses the different consensus algorithm for IoE technology.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drones is a technology with a huge potential for proving different efficient solutions in the smart city. It has been mostly adopted by military, aviation, civil, and commercial sectors for audio and video surveillance. The communication and security challenges of UAV is well mentioned by researchers and organizations (defense) around the world, although many of the challenges remain unresolved (especially for sensitive and consumer-related applications). Moreover, the conventional network systems may not be very efficient in dealing with the dynamic requirements of UAVs. As the UAVs are generally deployed in tough environments and terrains, therefore it is quite essential to provide a strong and secure network. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive survey on security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks as per the literature published till the fourth quarter of 2019. It also presents the taxonomy of existing security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks. Based on the findings from the survey, we present a Blockchain (BC)-based security solution and a summary of research challenges in the integration of BC with 5G-enabled UAV. Then, we present a case study of implementing BC with UAVs to secure industrial applications.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) turns into another time of the Internet, which contains connected smart objects over the Internet. IoT has numerous applications, for example, smart city, smart home, smart grid and healthcare. In common, the IoT system comprises of heterogeneous devices that deliver then trade endless sums of safety-critical information, also as privacy-sensitive information. Nevertheless, connected devices can give your business a genuine lift, yet anything that is connected to the Internet can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Most present IoT arrangements rely upon centralized architecture by associating with cloud servers through the Internet. The public cloud is described as computing services publicized by third-party suppliers over the Internet, making them accessible to anybody who needs to use or buy them. This solution gives magnificent flexible calculation and information the executives capacities, as IoT systems are developing increasingly mind-boggling; nonetheless, despite everything, it faces different of security issues. One of the weaknesses is that your information moving in IoT devices by means of public cloud could be in danger, despite the fact that the hacker was not explicitly focusing on you and with the public cloud you have insignificant authority over how rapidly you can grow the cloud. In this case, a secured protocol in IoT is vital to ensure optimum security to the information being traded between connected devices. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review on existing security protocols and propose a development methodology of a blockchain-based lightweight security model that provides end to end security. By utilizing lightweight, an authenticated client can get to the information of IoT sensors remotely. The presentation investigation shows that lightweight offers better security, less overheads, and low communication.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB With the advent and proliferation of the internet, the fourth industrial revolution is in full swing. As a result, different technologies have the potential to impact the course of human development. In other words, worldwide populations are moving towards growing urban centers and as a result, smart cities are emerging as the integration of human activities and technologies. These smart cities are built on top of different technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, the applications of these technologies in current and future smart cities will not only change the nature of human interaction and governance but also how business is conducted. This paper proposes an experimental study (qualitative and quantitative) that will determine the impact of blockchain and IoT technologies on the development of smart cities. It aims to derive insight from questions such as how current business models are preparing themselves for this disruption, the challenges they will face, and the potential contributions the two technologies will have on business development. The study's outcomes will provide the rationale for why businesses should start paying attention to these technologies and start on an early adoption plan that will slowly transform their business models as smart cities mature.

AB Industries around the world has revolutionized with the arrival of blockchain technology. Blockchain applications and use cases are in the process of development in different domains. This research presents a blockchain platform "JobChain" to manage the job recruitments. The case study is conducted for the job recruitments in various Ministries in Sultanate of Oman. Currently, in Oman, citizens are aware of the job vacancies through the advertisements posted in newspapers or social media. A job seeker then applies for the desired job and thereafter the qualified candidates are called for tests/interviews. To ease this process, a solution based on blockchain which includes various Ministries and the citizens/residents of Sultanate of Oman is proposed in this research. Ministries can post the job vacancies in the blockchain and qualified citizen(s) can submit their application. Relevant cryptographic functions are used to verify the authenticity of the participants in the blockchain network. The citizens feel the existence of a trusted secure government, which is mandatory for the development of a country. Unlike traditional models, blockchain eliminates the need of intermediary agents (e.g. Job Consultancies) thereby providing direct communication between the participants of the blockchain. The proposed blockchain framework helps the citizens in Oman to get updated about the job vacancies. Hyperledger Composer Playground is used to design and test the proposed blockchain business network. Preliminary results show that the participants and assets are created successfully and the transactions to approve a job vacancy and a job application is done through the proposed blockchain network.

AB Written informed consent (WIC) is required in the context of voluntary participation in a clinical trial. The trial participant gives WIC in accordance with various regulatory requirements. We present a framework concept for a blockchain-based distributed ledger solution, which aims at implementing simple and secure management of WIC documentation, along the entire data value chain from acquiring consent to academic publication, and (commercially) exploiting the results of a clinical study. This may include (but is not limited to) clinical deployment, security monitoring, and conformity with data privacy and ethical standards. Thus, we present a potential "Health AI" application that goes beyond WIC documentation, to enabling the creation of a holistic data provenance trail graph. Such a framework concept aims to create sustainable value for study participants, clinicians, data scientists, and ultimately consumers. The framework's usefulness is relevant for ensuring the ethical development of artificial intelligence applications in the healthcare domain.

AB Blockchain is a developing technology that can be utilized for secure data storage and sharing. In this work, we examine the cost of Blockchain-based data storage for constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We had two phases in the study. In the first phase, we stored data retrieved from a temperature/humidity sensor connected to an Ethereum testnet blockchain using smart contracts in two different ways: first, appending the new data to the existing data, storing all sensor data; and second, overwriting the new data onto the existing data, storing only a recent portion of the data. In the second phase, we stored simulated data from several sensors on the blockchain assuming sensor data is numeric. We proposed a method for encoding the data from the sensors in one variable and compared the costs of storing the data in an array versus storing the encoded data from all sensors in one variable. We also compared the costs of carrying out the encoding within the smart contract versus outside the smart contract. In the first phase, our results indicate that overwriting data points is more cost-efficient than appending them. In the second phase, using the proposed encoding method to store the data from several sensors costs significantly less than storing the data in an array, if the encoding is done outside the smart contract. If the encoding is carried out in the smart contract, the cost is still less than storing the data in an array, however, the difference is not significant. The study shows that even though expensive, for applications where the integrity and transparency of data are crucial, storing IoT sensor data on Ethereum could be a reliable solution.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted more and more attention from academia and industry recently. Ethereum, which uses blockchain technology, is a distributed computing platform and operating system. Smart contracts are small programs deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. Errors in smart contracts will lead to huge losses. Formal verification can provide a reliable guarantee for the security of blockchain smart contracts. In this paper, the formal method is applied to inspect the security issues of smart contracts. We summarize five kinds of security issues in smart contracts and present formal verification methods for these issues, thus establishing a formal verification framework that can effectively verify the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. Furthermore, we present a complete formal verification of the Binance Coin (BNB) contract. It shows how to formally verify the above security issues based on the formal verification framework in a specific smart contract. All the proofs are checked formally using the Coq proof assistant in which contract model and specification are formalized. The formal work of this paper has a variety of essential applications, such as the verification of blockchain smart contracts, program verification, and the formal establishment of mathematical and computer theoretical foundations.

AB The traditional method of blockchain retrieval is to search the "Block File" in sequence from the "tail" to the "head" of the blockchain, which always takes a lot of time. How to reduce the retrieval time has been a hot issue in blockchain research. This paper proposes a fast retrieval method for the Multi-Transaction Mode Consortium Blockchain (MTMCB). Firstly, we create a "User Set" and "Block Name Set" cached in Redis. Then, according to the transaction participants and "Block Name Set", we can get the relevant "Block Name List", and quickly obtain the corresponding block files. On this basis, in order to meet the needs of rapid retrieval in large-scale systems, an improved retrieval algorithm based on a B+-tree data structure is proposed. Firstly, the block file information is put into different ordered sets according to the transaction participants, and the B+-tree index is established to quickly get the information of relevant block files by participants. Experimental results show that the improved method of Redis cache retrieval in this paper can greatly increase the efficiency of blockchain retrieval, and can settle some crucial problem in the blockchain application and popularization.

AB Crowdsensing is an emerging paradigm of data aggregation, which has a pivotal role in data-driven applications. By leveraging the recruitment, a crowdsensing system collects a large amount of data from mobile devices at a low cost. The critical issues in the development of crowdsensing are platform security, privacy protection, and incentive. However, the existing centralized, platform-based approaches suffer from the single point of failure which may result in data leakage. Besides, few previous studies have addressed the considerations of both the economic incentive and data quality. In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing architecture based on blockchain technology which will help improve the attack resistance. Furthermore, we present a hybrid incentive mechanism, which integrates the data quality, reputation, and monetary factors to encourage participants to contribute their sensing data while discouraging malicious behaviors. The effectiveness our of proposed incentive model is verified through a combination of the theory of mechanism design. The performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed hybrid incentive model is a reliable and efficient mean to promote data security and incentivizing positive conduct on the crowdsensing application.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) benefits our lives by integrating physical devices to the real world and offers a crucial internet infrastructure for future civilization. Because IoT devices are widely distributed and restricted in resources, it is difficult for them to adopt traditional security methods to resist malicious attacks. Unauthorized access to IoT devices, which results in severe privacy and security problems, has become a major challenge that has impeded IoT technology from being widely adopted. Therefore, the access control for IoT devices urgently needs to be improved when dealing with authorization issues. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based access control scheme that provides decentralized, flexible, and fine-grained authorization for IoT devices. Blockchain is utilized to provide authentic and reliable credentials. More importantly, a verifiable collaboration mechanism is designed to meet the needs of controlled access authorization in emergencies. Authority nodes are constructed to execute major computation tasks and interact with the blockchain. The security analysis shows that our scheme can reliably guarantee the security of authorized access. More than security assurance, a proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented to prove that our scheme is scalable, efficient, and accommodates IoT devices well.

AB With the rise of "cross-border-e-commerce", the third-party-forwarding-logistics (3PFL) service becomes increasingly popular. Different from the traditional third-party-logistics (3PL) service, the 3PFL company provides forwarding services cost-effectively by consolidating orders from different e-tailers/platforms. The random arrivals of orders create a big challenge. Different from most of the existing studies, a deep learning based one-step integration optimal decision making approach S2SCL(Seq2Seq based CNN-LSTM) is proposed in this paper which intelligently integrates inventory optimization and demand-forecasting process. The Seg2Seq based forecasting architecture, which integrates CNN and LSTM network, is able to model the system dynamics and dependency-relations in varying demand for logistics services. Besides generating the point forecasting results, the proposed approach can quantify demand uncertainty via a dynamic distribution and make optimal decision on logistics service capacity allocation. Through a case-study analysis with real data obtained from a 3PFL company in China's Great Bay Area, we compare the proposed S2SCL with two benchmark models, including a one-step statistics based integration approach ARIMA and a two-step optimization based approach PSO-ELM, for two tasks: (1) point forecasting and (2) optimal logistic service capacity (LSC) allocation. Experimental results show that S2SCL outperforms the two benchmark models in both tasks significantly.

AB In this work, we proposed the tuning of the interface between attapulgite (ATP) and polycarbonate (PC) by the surface tailoring of ATP via a combination of RAFT polymerization and alkynyl-thiol click reaction. The side alkynyl-functionalized random copolymer poly(MMA-co-PgMA) was synthesized as the immobilization block via redox-initiated room-temperature RAFT copolymerization of MMA and propargyl methacrylate (PgMA). Then, the dispersion block was synthesized by room-temperature RAFT polymerization of MMA using poly(MMA-coPgMA) as the macro chain transfer agent to afford poly((MMA-co-PgMA)-b-MMA). FTIR, H-1 NMR, gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), and kinetic results indicated the successful synthesis of copolymers with well-defined structures. Copolymers with different length of PMMA segment were tethered onto the surface of thiol-functionalized ATP via alkynyl-thiol click reaction to mediate the interfacial interaction between ATP and PC, the successful covalent grafting of copolymers was confirmed by FTIR, TGA, XPS and XRD, and the effects of dispersion blockchain length on nanocomposites were investigated. The functionalized ATP demonstrated an improved dispersity in nanocomposites and enhanced mechanical properties with increasing dispersion block-chain length. The PC nanocomposites with functionalized ATP showed lower T-g and complex viscosity as compared to that of pure PC and nanocomposites with bare ATP, which enhanced the processability of nanocomposites.

AB Blockchain technology is based on the idea of a distributed, replicated, and immutable digital ledger that enables parties to conduct business in a trustful and transparent way without the need for a central authority or intermediary. Its most popular application thus far is in payment system applications, e.g., bitcoin. This disruptive technology is expected to contribute significant business value to multiple industry sectors, including supply chain management (SCM), where it can provide greater visibility, accountability and trust in interorganizational business collaboration. In this article, we review some fundamental concepts of Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain implementations. Further, we use the context of a food supply chain to highlight key design and implementation challenges for blockchain, and provide a strategic assessment of its prospects. Our aim is to dispel misguided notions and myths about blockchain as a silver bullet for all businesses. We believe it is important to penetrate the hype to allow a more realistic understanding of this technology. Blockchain is a high-cost, high-overhead storage medium. It is viable only when its higher cost is counterbalanced by the set of benefits that are identified by a careful and thorough analysis of the business. Thus, it will be used mainly for storing important data related to interorganizational transactions among partners where trust is lacking and provenance and visibility are critical. Our paper offers enterprises a systematic way to understand the real costs and risks of blockchain adoption. The insights gained in the SCM context also apply to other areas such as financial services and healthcare that could leverage the full potential of blockchain technology.

AB Wireless body area network includes some tiny wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological data of user, which has been a promising method of promoting the quality and efficiency greatly in healthcare. The collected physical signs are aggregated into the medical documents and uploaded to cloud server for utilizing by the remote user. As these files are highly sensitive privacy data, there is a vital challenge that constructs a secure and efficient communication architecture in this application scenario. Based on this standpoint, we present a lightweight verifiability ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption protocol with outsourced decryption in this article. Specifically, our construction enjoys the following six features: (1) Although the outsourced decryption enables to save the computation overhead of the data user sharply in an attribute-based encryption scheme, the ciphertext is out of control and the correctness cannot be guaranteed by the data owner. The proposal provides the verifiability of ciphertext that ensures the user to check the correctness efficiently. (2) The size of the ciphertext is constant that is not increased with the complexity of attribute and access structure. (3) For Internet of Things devices, it introduces the fog computing into our protocol for the purpose of low latency and relation interactions, which has virtually saved the bandwidth. (4) With the help of blockchain technique, we encapsulate the hash value of public parameter, original and transformed ciphertext and transformed key into a block, so that the tamper-resistance is facilitated against an adversary from inside and outside the system. (5) In the standard model, we prove that it is selectively chosen-plaintext attack-secure and verifiable provided that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption holds. (6) It implements this protocol and shows the result of performance measurement, which indicates a significant reduction on communication and computation costs burden on every entity in wireless body area network.

AB Health record maintenance and sharing are one of the essential tasks in the healthcare system. In this system, loss of confidentiality leads to a passive impact on the security of health record whereas loss of integrity leads can have a serious impact such as loss of a patient's life. Therefore, it is of prime importance to secure electronic health records. Health records are represented by Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standards and managed by Health Level Seven International Healthcare Standards Organization. Centralized storage of health data is attractive to cyber-attacks and constant viewing of patient records is challenging. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system using the cloud that helps to ensure authentication and that also provides integrity to health records. The keyless signature infrastructure used in the proposed system for ensuring the secrecy of digital signatures also ensures aspects of authentication. Furthermore, data integrity is managed by the proposed blockchain technology. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by comparing the parameters like average time, size, and cost of data storage and retrieval of the blockchain technology with conventional data storage techniques. The results show that the response time of the proposed system with the blockchain technology is almost 50% shorter than the conventional techniques. Also they express the cost of storage is about 20% less for the system with blockchain in comparison with the existing techniques.

AB In this paper, the novel fog communications and computing paradigm is addressed by presenting an integrated system architecture, that is applied to achieve a full context awareness for vehicular networks and, consequently, to react on traffic anomalous conditions. In particular, we propose to adopt a specific co-designed approach involving application and networks layers. For the latter one, as no infrastructure usually exists, effective routing protocols are needed to guarantee a certain level of reliability of the information collected from individual vehicles. As a consequence, we investigated classical epidemic flooding based, network coding inspired and chord protocols. Besides, we resort to blockchain principle to design a distributed consensus sensing application. The system has been tested by resorting to OMNeT++ framework for its modularity, high fidelity and flexibility. Performance analysis has been conducted over realistic scenarios in terms of consensus making overhead, latency and scalability, pointing out the better trade-off allowing the overlay P2P network formation and the complete context awareness achieved by the vehicles community.

AB Mobile Ad-hoc Cloud (MAC) is the constellation of nearby mobile devices to serve the heavy computational needs of the resource-constrained edge devices. One of the major challenges of MAC is to convince the mobile devices to offer their limited resources for the shared computational pool. Credit-based rewarding system is considered as an effective way of incentivizing the arbitrary mobile devices for joining the MAC network and to earn the credits through computational crowdsourcing. The next challenge is to get the reliable computation as incentives attract the malicious devices to submit fake computational results for claiming their reward and we have used the blockchain based reputation system for identifying the malicious participants of MAC. This paper presents a malicious node identification algorithm integrated within the Iroha based permissioned blockchain. Iroha is a project of hyperledger which is focused on mobile devices and thus light-weight in nature. It is used for keeping the track of rewarding and reputation system driven by the malicious node detection algorithm. Experiments are conducted for evaluating the implemented test-bed and results show the effectiveness of algorithm in identifying the malicious devices and conducting reliable data analysis through the blockchain based computational crowdsourcing in MAC.

TI Consortium Blockchain-Based Secure Software Defined Vehicular Network

AB The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a promising technology that can provide Internet access services for vehicles. With the development of VANET, tremendous intelligent vehicles will emerge mass and different communication requirements. Software-defined networking (SDN) is regarded as a potential technology to enhance network performance. In recent years, a new networking paradigm called software defined vehicular networks (SDVN) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the security issues still need to be considered for SDVN, because malicious vehicles can put forward fake requirements on the control plane of SDVN, which deteriorates the network performance in a certain degree. In this paper, we associate resources allocation problem with trust value of vehicles for the first time. The trust value of vehicles can be obtained through trust management system. Considering that there are many defects in the state-in-art trust management schemes, in this paper, a decentralized trust management architecture is designed which constitutes of three layers based on consortium blockchain. A joint proof-of-stake and modified practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PoS-mPBFT) algorithm is proposed to the shorten the confirmation time, which is deployed on RSUs. Different from previous researches that focus on designing methods to evaluate trust value, we use prediction model to estimate trust value of vehicles in the next period. After calculating trust value of vehicles, it assigns more resources to those high credibility vehicles when SDN services are provided. Meanwhile, to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, we convert the multiple-path mapping problem of the virtual network into the multi-commodity flow problem, which is solved by a heuristic algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed trust management architecture and heuristic algorithm could provide better safety in SDVN and shorten consensus time, meanwhile effectively abstract underlying resources to enhance network load balance and capacity.

AB Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, EOS, Etherum, Litecoin, and others) are disrupting the traditional banking and financial systems. The cryptocurrencies are based on a set of technologies commonly referred to as blockchain technology. The potential effect of blockchain technology on institutional economics is profound. Already, blockchain technology-based applications in supply chain management, marketing, and finance are decentralizing and streamlining vital institutional functions. In this paper, we examine the economics of blockchain technologies as it pertains to transaction costs in startup financing. We draw upon the theory of transaction cost economics and the transactional nature of blockchain technology to propose a model to demonstrate how and why blockchain technology based applications are effective. We then apply the model to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to overcome many problems inherent in startup financing. For example, information asymmetry and transaction costs involved with matching an entrepreneur with an investor and the terms of the financing deal are some of the fundamental issues in entrepreneurial financing. We explain how a financing system based on blockchain technology can ameliorate the problems and lead to a more effective and decentralized entrepreneurial financing process.

AB Distributed energy resources are located near users, which can realize energy cascade utilization and improve the energy utilization efficiency. The features of distributed ledgers and smart contract auto-execution possessed by blockchain technology are in line with the requirements of distributed energy resources in billing and settlement, which provides a direction for the application of blockchain technology in the distributed energy resources. The integration of distributed energy resources in China with blockchain technology may break the existing pattern where the production, transportation, distribution and sales of energy are centralized. This paper first summarizes the current status of distributed energy resources in China and blockchain technology, and then uses the Michael Porter five forces model to analyze the competitiveness of distributed energy resources. The rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of alternatives, bargaining power of suppliers, and bargaining power of buyers in energy industry are presented and analyzed. Based on the competitiveness analysis, the SWOT model is used to analyze the joint development model of "blockchain technology + distributed energy resources", and the feasibility of blockchain technology applied to distributed energy resources systems is revealed. Finally, the paper puts forward the key conclusions that blockchain technology can enhance the competitiveness of distributed energy resources as well as relevant policy recommendations.

AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have fascinated technologists and investors alike. They have become prevalent, with over 2,000 Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies now in use. Most jurisdictions have not regulated cryptocurrencies. Whether existing regulations apply to cryptocurrency turns ultimately on if we classify cryptocurrencies as currencies, securities, or derivatives, or a money services (transfer) vehicle. In this set of exploratory analyses we seek to classify Bitcoin. We utilize a variety of methods to compare aspects of its behavior to: currencies, asset classes such as derivatives, technology-based products and possible technology-based products such as Ether and the security SPY, and speculative financial bubbles. We find that Bitcoin's behavior more closely resembles a technology-based product, an emerging asset class, or a bubble event, rather than a currency or a security; such that it is correct that existing currency and security laws should not apply to cryptocurrencies.

AB We examine the response of a broad set of digital assets to US Federal Fund interest rate and quantitative easing announcements, specifically examining associated volatility spillover and feedback effects. We classify each digital asset into one of three categories: Currencies; Protocols; and Decentralised Applications (dApps). Currency-based digital assets experience idiosyncratic spillovers in the period immediately after US monetary policy announcements, while application or protocol-based digital assets are largely immune to policy volatility spillover and feedback. Mineable digital assets are found to be more susceptible to monetary policy volatility spillovers and feedback than non-mineable. Responses indicate a diverse market within which, not all assets are comparable to Bitcoin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible deployment and innovation of new networking applications by decoupling and abstracting the control and data planes. It has radically changed the concept and way of building and managing networked systems, and reduced the barriers to entry for new players in the service markets. It is considered to be a promising solution providing the scale and versatility necessary for IoT. However, SDN may also face many challenges, i.e., the centralized control plane would be a single point of failure. With the advent of blockchain technology, blockchain-based SDN has become an emerging architecture for securing a distributed network environment. Motivated by this, in this work, we summarize the generic framework of blockchain-based SDN, discuss security challenges and relevant solutions, and provide insights on the future development in this field.

AB To enable large-scale and ubiquitous automotive network access, traditional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies are evolving to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for increasing demands on emerging advanced vehicular applications, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles. In recent years, IoV technologies have been developed and achieved significant progress. However, it is still unclear what is the evolution path and what are the challenges and opportunities brought by IoV. For the aforementioned considerations, this article provides a thorough survey on the historical process and status quo of V2X technologies, as well as demonstration of emerging technology developing directions toward IoV. We first review the early stage when the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) was issued as an important initial beginning and compared the cellular V2X with IEEE 802.11 V2X communications in terms of both the pros and cons. In addition, considering the advent of big data and cloud-edge regime, we highlight the key technical challenges and pinpoint the opportunities toward the big data-driven IoV and cloud-based IoV, respectively. We believe our comprehensive survey on evolutionary V2X technologies toward IoV can provide beneficial insights and inspirations for both academia and the IoV industry.

AB As a new and rapidly developing distributed technology, blockchain has shown substantial impact on the fields of cryptocurrency and e-commerce and thus has attracted the interests of governments, enterprises, and research institutions. As such, it is important to understand the state of blockchain research in order for those institutions to plan their research effectively. Towards this goal, we first integrate two search strategies to construct a representative dataset. Then we analyze the blockchain literature between 2013 and 2018 in this dataset with a science mapping approach and Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Based on the results of the analysis, we found the following insights: (1) the evolution of blockchain research involves many disciplines while two major disciplines-computer science and business-lead the way. (2) The current research can be divided into four research areas: underlying technology architecture, privacy and security, financial application, and smart scene applications. (3) The evolution of blockchain research has gone through three stages: basic blockchain technology, various business applications, and integration with advanced technologies such as fog computing, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence. (4) We also discovered a close coupling of two research issues that have transformative power, i.e., the potential by the application of cryptocurrency in the real world and the improvement of blockchain technology based on the application requirements.

TI Deanonymizing Tor hidden service users through Bitcoin transactions

SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY

DT Article
DE Bitcoin; Tor hidden services; Privacy; Deanonymization; Attack
AB With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously seeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. By exploiting publicly available information, we show how relying on Bitcoin for payments on Tor hidden services could lead to deanonymization of these services' users. Such linking is possible by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses.
   To demonstrate the consequences of this deanonymization approach, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique and active Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled 5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the information leakage on users anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should be considered exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Management of public finance and economic development is the art by which a nation improves the economic, political and social well-being of its people. The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error. We have to manage our work and time differently. We are living in a digital and intelligent era, where machines take over repetitive, time-consuming and redundant tasks, giving finance professionals more time to approach higher level and more lucrative analysis and research.

AB Smart contracts allow verifiable operations to be executed in blockchains, bringing new possibilities for trust establishment in trustless scenarios. However, smart contracts are cumbersome when used as security mechanisms in security scenarios due to two reasons: they have limited power and are inert to changes.
   In order to mitigate the two problems of employed smart contracts, we propose LSC, a framework for online auto-update smart contracts in blockchain-based log systems, to enable self-adaptive log anomaly detection via smart contracts. Time-varying log anomaly detection patterns are extracted by self-adaptive machine learning log anomaly analysis and are continuously fed to the contracts. The framework allows smart contracts to be automatically updated to express the patterns in low-cost ways. The anomaly detection strategies for audit log systems are shared and collaboratively enforced amongst network nodes to defend against targeted detection evasion. We provide a plain prototype as a proof of the feasibility and efficiency of LSC in log systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   healthcare records
AB Modern healthcare systems are characterized as being highly complex and costly. However, this can be reduced through improved health record management, utilization of insurance agencies, and blockchain technology. Blockchain was first introduced to provide distributed records of money-related exchanges that were not dependent on centralized authorities or financial institutions. Breakthroughs in blockchain technology have led to improved transactions involving medical records, insurance billing, and smart contracts, enabling permanent access to and security of data, as well as providing a distributed database of transactions. One significant advantage of using blockchain technology in the healthcare industry is that it can reform the interoperability of healthcare databases, providing increased access to patient medical records, device tracking, prescription databases, and hospital assets, including the complete life cycle of a device within the blockchain infrastructure. Access to patients' medical histories is essential to correctly prescribe medication, with blockchain being able to dramatically enhance the healthcare services framework. In this paper, several solutions for improving current limitations in healthcare systems using blockchain technology are explored, including frameworks and tools to measure the performance of such systems, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Composer, Docker Container, Hyperledger Caliper, and the Wireshark capture engine. Further, this paper proposes an Access Control Policy Algorithm for improving data accessibility between healthcare providers, assisting in the simulation of environments to implement the Hyperledger-based eletronic healthcare record (EHR) sharing system that uses the concept of a chain-code. Performance metrics in blockchain networks, such as latency, throughput, Round Trip Time (RTT). have also been optimized for achieving enhanced results. Compared to traditional EHR systems, which use client-server architecture, the proposed system uses blockchain for improving efficiency and security. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For the past century economists have proposed a suite of theories relating to industrial dynamics, technological change and innovation. There has been an implication in these models that the institutional environment is stable. However, a new class of institutional technologies-most notably blockchain technology-lower the cost of institutional entrepreneurship along these margins, propelling a process of institutional evolution. This presents a new type of innovation process, applicable to the formation and development of institutions for economic governance and coordination. This paper develops a replicator dynamic model of institutional innovation and proposes some implications of this innovation for innovation policy. Given the influence of public policies on transaction costs and associated institutional choices, it is indicated that policy settings conductive to the adoption and use of blockchain technology would elicit entrepreneurial experiments in institutional forms harnessing new coordinative possibilities in economic exchange. Conceptualisation of blockchain-related public policy an innovation policy in its own right has significant implications for the operation and understanding of open innovation systems in a globalised context.

AB Background: Blockchain can be described as an immutable ledger, logging data entries in a decentralized manner. This new technology has been suggested to disrupt a wide range of data-driven domains, including the health domain.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically review, assess and synthesize peer-reviewed publications utilizing/proposing to utilize blockchain to improve processes and services in healthcare, health sciences and health education.
   Method: A structured literature search on the topic was conducted in October 2018 relevant bibliographic databases.
   Result: 39 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The result indicates that Electronic Health Records and Personal Health Records are the most targeted areas using blockchain technology. Access control, interoperability, provenance and data integrity are all issues that are meant to be improved by blockchain technology in this field. Ethereum and Hyperledger fabric seem to be the most used platforms/frameworks in this domain.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the endeavors of using blockchain technology in the health domain are increasing exponentially. There are areas within the health domain that potentially could be highly impacted by blockchain technology.

AB Although a lot of work has been done in the domain, tasks scheduling and resource allocation in cloud computing remain the challenging problems for both industry and academia. Security in scheduling in highly distributed computing environments is one of the most important criteria in the era of personalization of the cloud services. Blockchain became recently a promising technology for integration with the cloud clusters and improvement of the security of cloud transactions and access to data and application codes. In this paper, we developed a new model of the cloud scheduler based on the blockchain technology. Differently to the other similar models, we tried to offload the implementation of the blockchain modules. We developed a novel 'proof-of-schedule' consensus algorithm (instead of 'proof-of-work') and used the Stackelberg games for the improvement of the approval of the generated schedules. The developed model has been experimentally simulated and validated by using the new original cloud simulator. The proposed Blockchain Scheduler was also compared with other selected cloud schedulers. The experiments shows that the applied approach improved significantly the efficiency of prepared schedules, in most cases, simulator returns a schedule with better makespan than existing individual scheduling modules.

AB A smart grid is a two-way communication distributed energy network that enables efficient energy generation and distribution. Due to increased interest in renewable energy production and consumption, energy distribution using a centralized grid architecture has limited applicability. Blockchain technology has attained significant attention recently and provides a number of ways for reliable processing and storage of data in a decentralized manner. It is now recognized that trustless decentralized energy production and transfer using blockchain technology is a promising approach. This work proposes a novel blockchain-based decentralized green energy distribution system for trustless reliable energy exchanges in a smart grid. The proof of distribution problem in a decentralized environment is first formalized. The reliability and validity of the energy distribution system is established by way of a robustness evaluation model. An extensive experimental study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness and soundness of the solution. Finally, a decentralized green energy distribution smart-grid case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the system in real-life situations. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB In location-sensitive applications, dishonest users may submit fake location claims to illegally access a service or obtain benefit. To address this issue, a number of location proof mechanisms have been proposed in literature. However, they confront various security and privacy challenges, including Prover-Prover collusions (Terrorist Frauds), Prover-Witness collusions, and location privacy threats. In this paper, we utilize the unique features of the blockchain technology to design a decentralized scheme for location proof generation and verification. In the proposed scheme, a user who needs a location proof (called a prover) broadcasts a request to the neighbor devices through a short-range communication interface, e.g. Bluetooth. Those neighbor devices that decide to respond (called witnesses) start to authenticate the requesting user. We integrate an incentive mechanism into the proposed scheme to reward such witnesses. Upon successful authentication, a transaction is generated as a location proof and is broadcast onto a peer-to-peer network where it can be picked up by verifiers for final verification. Our security analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves a reliable performance against Prover-Prover and Prover-Witness collusions. Moreover, our prototype implementation on the Android platform shows that the proposed scheme outperforms other currently deployed location proof schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Physical world integration with cyber world opens the opportunity of creating smart environments; this new paradigm is called the Internet of Things (IoT). Communication between humans and objects has been extended into those between objects and objects. Industrial IoT (IIoT) takes benefits of loT communications in business applications focusing in interoperability between machines (i.e., IIoT is a subset from the IoT). Number of daily life things and objects connected to the Internet has been in increasing fashion, which makes the IoT be the dynamic network of networks. Challenges such as heterogeneity, dynamicity, velocity, and volume of data, make IoT services produce inconsistent, inaccurate, incomplete, and incorrect results, which are critical for many applications especially in IIoT (e.g., health-care, smart transportation, wearable, finance, industry, etc.). Discovering, searching, and sharing data and resources reveal 40% of IoT benefits to cover almost industrial applications. Enabling real-time data analysis, knowledge extraction, and search techniques based on Information Communication Technologies (ICT), such as data fusion, machine learning, big data, cloud computing, blockchain, etc., can reduce and control IoT and leverage its value. This research presents a comprehensive review to study state-of-the-art challenges and recommended technologies for enabling data analysis and search in the future IoT presenting a framework for ICT integration in IoT layers. This paper surveys current IoT search engines ( IoTSEs) and presents two case studies to reflect promising enhancements on intelligence and smartness of IoT applications due to ICT integration.

AB The adoption of blockchain technologies require the consideration of a broad range of factors, over and above the predominantly technology focus of most current work. Whilst scholarly literature on blockchain technology is only beginning to emerge, majority are focused on the technicalities of the technology and tend to ignore the organizational complexities of adopting the technology. Drawing from a focused review of literature, this paper proposed a conceptual framework for adoption of blockchain technology capturing the complex relationships between institutional, market and technical factors. The framework highlights that varying outcomes are possible, and the change process is focal as this shapes the form blockchain applications take. Factors presented in the framework (institutional, market and technical) interact and mutually influence each other. The proposed framework can be used by organisations as a reference point for adopting blockchain applications and by scholars to expand, refine and evaluate research into blockchain technology.

AB There has been significant recent interest in local electricity trading platforms, and particularly in the application of distributed ledger and blockchain technology for distributed, or peer-to-peer energy trading in local energy communities. Several projects worldwide have demonstrated this concept on a small scale in Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks and microgrids. However, previous work in this area has not sufficiently addressed the potential impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading and other local electricity trading mechanisms on the control, operation and planning of the electricity distribution networks. Accordingly, this paper presents a methodology for the co-simulation of power distribution networks and local peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. The distribution system simulator is interfaced with a peer-to-peer energy trading platform, which employs a blockchain-based distributed double auction trade mechanism. The presented co-simulation approach is demonstrated using a case study of typical European suburban distribution network. It is demonstrated in the paper that this approach can be used to analyse the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on network operational performance. The analysis presented in the paper suggests that a moderate level of peer-to-peer trading does not have significant impacts on network operational performance.

DE Logistics 4.0; risks; risk management
AB Currently we are saying that we are at the dawn of the fourth revolution, which is marked by using cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. This is marked as Industry 4.0 (I4.0). With Industry 4.0 is also closely linked concept Logistics 4.0. The highly dynamic and uncertain logistic markets and huge logistic networks require new methods, products and services. The concept of the Internet of Things and Services (IoT&S), Big Data/Data Mining (DM), cloud computing, 3D printing, Blockchain and cyber physical system (CPS) etc. seem to be the probable technical solution for that. However, associated risks hamper its implementation and lack a comprehensive overview. In response, the paper proposes a framework of risks in the context of Logistics 4.0. They are here economic risks, that are associated e.g. with high or false investments. From a social perspective, risks the job losses, are considered too. Additionally, risks can be associated with technical risks, e.g. technical integration, information technology (IT)-related risks such as data security, and legal and political risks, such as for instance unsolved legal clarity in terms of data possession. It is therefore necessary to know the potential risks in the implementation process.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to explore the critical factors that affect users' acceptance and usage intention toward blockchain-based smart lockers.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research is designed in two phases. In the first phase, the key stakeholders are interviewed. Participants include managers from technology providers and logistics companies. In the second phase, a questionnaire survey is used to validate the proposed model.
   Findings
   Based on the final results, this study makes the following three suggestions. First, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are the critical factors. In other words, it is important to emphasize the function and convenience of a new service when introducing it to a potential user. Second, safety is not the major concern when using a blockchain-based smart locker. This means that users will trust the service provider for providing a secure service. Users do not worry about the security problem. Finally, the network externality of smart locker is also insignificant.
   Originality/value
   This study has three major contributions. First, this study identifies the critical factors that will affect user acceptance of blockchain-based smart lockers. Next, this study combines the opinions from service providers and users to understand the gap between different stakeholders. Finally, this study can enrich our understanding on the applications of blockchain from a managerial perspective and not only from a technical perspective, as in most previous studies.

AB Purpose
   The initiation of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin has invoked a general curiosity in the international financial regime. Bitcoin works in a peer-to-peer framework with no third party acting as a monitoring agency. This brings in both positive and negative spirit to the table. Though generic understanding is available, the studies done on bitcoin and blockchain are far and few. The purpose of this paper is to decipher the level of understanding the scientific world has on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain and thereby to find out the pertinent research gaps existing in this field.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A biblio-morphological analysis is undertaken which underscores a comprehensive framework characterizing the bitcoin and blockchain literature in terms of dimensions and options. This was developed as a result of extensive scanning of the relevant literature.
   Findings
   The biblio-morphological analysis broadly outlines the present status of the research on the topic. The morphological analysis brings out the 169 research gaps that exist in the area of bitcoin and underlying blockchain technology. The cross-consistency matrix underscores the fact that this novel technology bears large research potential.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a first comprehensive biblio-morphological analysis on bitcoin and underlying blockchain technology, which characterizes blockchain literature and thereby offers to reduce redundant research by delineating the possible avenues in the area of blockchain technology.

In this work, we have shown the potential of creating a Blockhchain based system for better healthcare management in Pakistan. It is an emerging technology with diversified applications. A literature review has been done regarding healthcare management using Blockchain technology in general in addition to general review of the current situation of healthcare sector in Pakistan. Based on this, a discussion has been provided as guideline for development of Blockchain based system for Pakistan. Stakeholders necessary for development of such system have been identified. Advantages and areas to address have also been highlighted. Future directions helping in development of such system are also part of the paper.

AB The properties of a blockchain such as immutability, provenance, and peer-executed smart contracts could bring a new level of security, trust, and transparency to e-learning. In this paper, we introduce our proof-of-concept blockchain-based e-learning platform developed to increase transparency in assessments and facilitate curriculum personalisation in a higher education context. Most notably, our platform could automate assessments and issue credentials. We designed it to be pedagogically neutral and content-neutral in order to showcase the benefits of a blockchain back-end to end users such as students and teaching staff. Our evaluation suggests that our platform could increase trust in online education providers, assessment procedures, education history and credentials.

AB Start-ups in the blockchain context generate millions by means of initial coin offerings (ICOs). Many of these crowdfunding endeavours are very successful, others are not. However, despite the increasing investments in ICOs, there is still neither sufficient theoretical knowledge nor a comprehensive understanding of the different types of business models and the implications for these token-based ecosystems. Scientific research equally lacks a thorough understanding of the different business model forms and their influence on collaboration in token-based economies. We bridge this gap by presenting a taxonomy of real-world blockchain-based start-ups. For this taxonomy, we used 195 start-ups and performed a cluster-analysis in order to identify three different archetypes and thus gain a deeper understanding. Our taxonomy and the archetypes can equally be seen as strategic guidance for practitioners as well as a starting point for future research concerning the token-based business models.

AB Blockchain, a decentralized validation protocol in which no one individual entity completely controls the process or information, is labeled both a "techno tour de force" and a "fraud." Austrian School researchers view the blockchain application Bitcoin as an ideal example of currency decentralization while ethics scholars fret about this very lack of control. Given the significant importance of the future of blockchain technology to a range of disciplines and the fragmented knowledge base with little cross-disciplinary integration to fields such as computer science and law, we begin by offering a nontechnical explanation of the basics of blockchain and its applications such as smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and initial coin offerings. We systematically review 152 articles in the burgeoning academic literature on blockchain and its applications and synthesize the findings from five parallel lines of enquiry for scholars: computer science, economics, entrepreneurship, and law and governance. Finally, we outline a comprehensive research agenda for scholars of regulation policy and governance, entrepreneurship and sustainability, organization design and theory, and consumer behavior, highlighting promising phenomenon, methodologies, data, and theories. We aim to simplify and explain blockchain for what it is-a valuable tool that is revolutionary, transformational, and critical for scholars to understand and investigate.

AB Purpose
   Maritime supply chains rely on electronic and paper-based processes, leading to efficiency bottlenecks. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theory for how implementing digitalization in the form of blockchain technology (BCT) can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of maritime supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This conceptual paper is grounded in dynamic capabilities, supply-chain management and digital supply-chain theories. Relevant literature is scrutinized to explain how BCT can improve supply-chain performance.
   Findings
   BCT mainly benefits supply-chain performance through the development of intangible capabilities, by leveraging the capabilities (resources) that maritime supply chains provide.
   Practical implications
   Investments in digitalization improve the overall information sharing, coordination and visibility capabilities and performances of supply chains.
   Originality/value
   Although literature on BCT is extensive, this framework paper is the first to link BCT with dynamics capabilities and maritime supply-chain theory and will serve as a road map for future research and practice.

AB A zero-knowledge proof or protocol is a cryptographic technique for verifying private data without revealing it in its clear form. In this paper, we evaluate the potential for zero-knowledge distributed ledger technology to alleviate asymmetry of information in the asset-backed securitization market. To frame this inquiry, we conducted market data analyses, a review of prior literature, stakeholder interviews with investors, originators and security issuers and collaboration with blockchain engineers and researchers. We introduce a new system which could enable all market participants in the securitization lifecycle (e.g. investors, rating agencies, regulators and security issuers) to interact on a unique decentralized platform while maintaining the privacy of loan-level data, therefore providing the industry with timely analytics and performance data. Our platform is powered by zkLedger (Narula et al. 2018), a zero-knowledge protocol developed by the MIT Media Lab and the first system that enables participants of a distributed ledger to run publicly verifiable analytics on masked data.

AB Quaternary ammonium-functionalized poly(ether sulfone) (QA-PES) block copolymers with different block chain lengths were prepared as anion exchange membranes. Copolymers with similar hydrophilic/ hydrophobic block ratios and hence similar IEC values, but with various oligomer block chain lengths were synthesized to investigate, for the first time, how the length of each oligomer included in the block copolymers affected the chemophysical and electrical properties of the obtained QA-PES anion exchange membranes. The copolymer with the optimal hydrophilic:hydrophobic block chain length (QA-PES-16-30) showed good phase separation. This led to the optimal formation of ionic clusters, and the highest ion conductivity of 81.01 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, as well as excellent physicochemical stability even after alkaline treatment in 1 M NaOH at 60 degrees C for 500 h, due to strengthening of the hydrophobic regions, strongly suggesting that the block chain length of each of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks can affect the physicochemical properties of the polymer membranes. The H-2/O-2 single cell performance using the QA-PES-16-30 membrane showed a maximum power density of 260 mW cm(-2), much higher than that obtained from the Tokuyama A201.

DE Hyperledger Fabric; Performance analysis; Analytical model; Batching
ID BLOCKCHAIN; INTERNET
AB The widespread application of the Hyperledger Fabric platform and the timeliness requirement of transactions on the platform necessitate the effective performance evaluation of transaction processing. The existing evaluation researches on Hyperledger Fabric ignored transaction endorsement failure (due to transaction endorsing duration timeout) and/or ignored block timeout. This paper considers these two timeout constraints and develops a hierarchical model for Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 transaction process from the time when transactions are submitted by clients until the completion of validating/committing transactions as a block. Formulas for calculating performance measures, including platform throughput, transaction rejection probability and mean transaction response delay, are derived. Extensive numerical analysis and simulations are carried out to verify the approximate accuracy of the model and formulas. Moreover, numerical analysis is applied to illustrate the impact of various parameters on performance measures.

AB Blockchain and cryptocurrency are a hot topic in today's digital world. In this paper, we create a game theoretic model in continuous time. We consider a dynamic game model of the bitcoin market, where miners or players use mining systems to mine bitcoin by investing electricity into the mining system. Although this work is motivated by BTC, the work presented can be applicable to other mining systems similar to BTC. We propose three concepts of dynamic game theoretic solutions to the model: Social optimum, Nash equilibrium and myopic Nash equilibrium. Using the model that a player represents a single "miner" or a "mining pool", we develop novel and interesting results for the cryptocurrency world.

AB Healthcare data is important in making critical policy decisions, patients care, and medical diagnostics to name a few. Due to the importance and market demand, healthcare data is also vulnerable to cyber attacks. The centralized record keeping systems expose a single node for the attackers to attack. A decentralized system is computationally expensive but has the ability to be revolutionary by keeping the patient at the core and providing security, transparency, privacy, and interoperability of the electronic healthcare data. A blockchain is such an implementation of a distributed and decentralized system using reliable cryptographic algorithms. This paper proposes a secure blockchain based architecture tailored specifically to cater to the needs of e-healthcare systems.

AB In the near future, manufacturing industries will be mostly recognised with characteristics like IoT, and massive data transactions. To fulfil these characteristics, paradigms like Cloud manufacturing, Industry 4.0 and smart factory have passed their preliminary steps to become the primary inspirations. Considering the nature of Cloud manufacturing which consists of a vast number of service providers and Service demanders being introduced to the manufacturing cloud, service composition problem is introduced. However, there is a big challenge for fulfilling the dynamic behaviour of parameters which change rapidly over time in the service composition problem. This paper challenges the centralised mechanism of service composition problem and introduces a novel platform entitled Blockchain-based service composition model (Block-SC) based on the Blockchain technology. Block-SC as a novel manufacturing architecture conquers the centralised mechanism by dividing the original service composition problem into multiple sub-problems each of which contains a small fraction of the service/task pool. The capabilities of the proposed platform are remarkable from two perspectives; first, it provides an effective mechanism for collaboration of service composition service providers with a service-oriented approach and from the second perspective, the optimality of service composition problem is profoundly affected considering the dynamic behaviour of Cloud manufacturing.

AB Purpose
   Blockchain, which was originally created to enable peer-to-peer digital payment systems (bitcoin), is considered to have several benefits for different sectors, such as the real estate one. In a standard European-wide real estate transaction, several intermediaries are involved. As a consequence, these agreements are usually time-consuming and involve extra difficulties to cross-border operations. As blockchain, combined with smart contracts, may have an important role in these transactions, this paper aims to explore its prospective challenges, limitations and opportunities in the real estate sector and discover how the traditional intermediaries have to face a possible implementation of this technology.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper analyses the current intermediaries in the real estate sector in European Union (EU), their functions and how can blockchain strengthen the security of these transactions while reducing their time. The author uses a legal methodology to approach it.
   Findings
   Blockchain, combined with smart contracts, has both challenges and opportunities for the real estate sector. On the one hand, it may improve procedures, allow EU transactions and the interconnection between public administration. However, to not reduce parties rights, this blockchain should have some special features, such as the possibility of being amended.
   Originality/value
   This paper provides a valuable overview of all the intermediaries that could be affected by blockchain protocols. It is of interest of blockchain developers, public administrations and researchers who are working on blockchain and property conveyancing.

AB The emergence of mobile cloud computing enables mobile users to offload computation tasks to other resource-rich mobile devices to reduce energy consumption and enhance performance. A direct peer-to-peer connection among mobile devices to offload computation tasks can be a highly promising solution to provide a fast mechanism, especially for deadline-sensitive offloading tasks. The generic blockchain-based system might fail in such a scenario due to it being a heavyweight mechanism requiring high power consumption in the mining process. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a directed acyclic graph-enabled mobile offloading (DAGMO) algorithm. DAGMO model is empowered by traditional blockchain features and provides additional advantages to overcome the fundamental limitations of generic blockchain. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the interactions between mobile devices. The numerical analysis proves the proposed model to enhance the overall welfare of the participating nodes in terms of computation cost and time.

AB An electronic business transaction among untrusted bodies without consulting a mutually trusted party has remained widely accepted problem. Blockchain resolves this problem by introducing peer-to-peer network with a consensus algorithm and trusted ledger. Blockchain originally introduced for cryptocurrency that came with proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Due to some performance issues, scientists brought concept of permissioned Blockchain. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned Blockchain targeting business-oriented problems for industry. It is designed for efficient transaction execution over Blockchain with pluggable consensus model; however, there is limitation of rapid application development. Hyperledger introduced a new layer called Hyperledger Composer on top of the Fabric layer, which provides an abstract layer to model the business application readily and quickly. Composer provides a smart contract to extend the functionality and flexibility of Fabric layer and provides a way of communication with other systems to meet business requirements. Hyperledger Composer uses role-based access control (RBAC) model to secure access to its valuable assets. However, RBAC is not enough because many business deals require continuous assets monitoring. Our proposed model, BlockU, covers all possible access control models required by a business. BlockU can monitor assets continuously during transactions and updates attributes accordingly. Moreover, we incorporate hooks in Hyperledger Composer to implement extended permission model that provides extensive permission management capability on an asset. Subsequently, our proposed enhanced access control model is implemented with a minimal change to existing Composer code base and is backward compatible with the current security mechanism.

AB The use of the "Blockchain" technological architecture is growing worldwide, given its structural characteristics aimed at security and information integrity, without the need for a central guarantor. Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum's Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paperbased current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum's Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern industry employs technologies for automation that may include Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud and/or Fog Computing, 5G as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), or Blockchain. Currently, a part of research for the new industrial era is in the direction of improving healthcare services. This work throws light on some of the major challenges in providing affordable, efficient, secure and reliable healthcare from the viewpoint of computer and medical sciences. We describe a vision of how a holistic model can fulfill the growing demands of healthcare industry, and explain a conceptual model that can provide a complete solution for these increasing demands. In our model, we elucidate the components and their interaction at different levels, leveraging state-of-the art technologies in IoT, Fog computing, AI, ML and Blockchain. We finally describe current trends in this field and propose future directions to explore emerging paradigms and technologies on evolution of healthcare leveraging next generation computing systems.

AB Growing environmental awareness and widening extended producer responsibility have heightened the need for economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable business strategies levered by digital technologies. As an extension, various take-back policies focusing on product waste and recovery are put in place by the high-tech manufacturing industry. With an attempt to increase sales while ensuring the environmental sustainability of products, trade-in programmes that incentivize consumers to exchange used goods for new and most recent technology products became a value-adding strategy for businesses. Due to the high unpredictability in the quality of returned devices however, determining trade-in margins is a challenging task for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This inevitably reveals the need for incorporating intelligent technologies into the formation of manufacturing and logistics architectures to simultaneously preserve OEMs profitability and ensure the sustainable development of the closed-loop supply chain activities. With this motivation, this study presents the use of IoT-embedded products in a blockchain-enabled disassembly-to-order system to determine the optimal trade-in-to-upgrade policy. A discrete-event simulation model is developed to obtain the expected cost of the disassembly-to-order system. Optimal incentives for varying product qualities are then computed by utilising this cost in the trade-in policy model.

AB Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture separates control plane and data plane, making network flexible and programmable. Since the large number of devices connected to the Internet of things (IoT) networks, the SDN-based network architecture makes the deployment and configuration of IoT much easier. In the IoT network, the fine-grained network traffic is critical to network management, then we propose a novel scheme to measure the fine-grained network traffic in the SDN-based IoT networks. In SDN-based IoT networks, the controller is very easy to be attacked, we introduce the blockchain technology into the measurement framework to ensure the security and consistency of the statistics. To measure flow traffic with low overhead and high accuracy, we collect the statistics of coarse-grained traffic of flows and fine-grained traffic of links, and model the network traffic as an ARIMA model and forecast the network traffic with the coarse-grained measurement of flows. Then, we propose an objective function to decrease the estimation errors. Due to the objective function is an NP-hard problem, we present a heuristic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of the fine-grained measurement. Finally, we conduct some simulations to verify the validity of the proposed measurement scheme. Simulation results show that our approach is feasible and effective.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to discuss the disrupting usage and impacts of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and advocate their role as enablers of sustainable tourism development goals.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Literature on blockchains and cryptocurrencies is critically synthesized, debated and expanded to identify and discuss their implications toward sustainable tourism futures.
   Findings
   As a distributive digital ledger, blockchains have the potential to create a more inclusive tourism future to address debates around tourism as a vehicle for sustainable development that alludes to value accruing to only certain providers and consumers. Blockchains and their cryptocurrencies (as a financial transaction capability) elevate trust and relational capabilities in an expedited and holistic manner, democratize participation in economic systems and re-distribute power and economic relations amongst actors by influencing the way data (the currency of the digital economy and the lifeblood of tourism) is collected, stored, exchange, owned and traded for co-creating value.
   Originality/value
   The paper contributes to the emerging but controversial literature about the trajectories between technology and sustainability by critically debating on how blockchains, through cryptocurrency economies, can be positioned to facilitate sustainable tourism futures.

AB Background: Supply chain management (SCM) has grown considerably, owing largely to globalisation, advancements in technology and its pivotal role in meeting the dynamic needs of customers. As supply chains (SCs) expand, complexity also increases, as does the associated demand for well-skilled SC professionals. To achieve the expected SCM skills in organisations, a skills framework is likely to guide managers and practitioners. Unfortunately, research on SCM skills frameworks is fragmented, providing little or no guidance to practitioners.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to document the SC skills described in the literature, identify existing frameworks and propose a framework to guide practitioners and academics.
   Method: A systematic literature review design was followed. The data obtained were analysed using content analysis.
   Results: About 270 SCM skills were identified. The skills were grouped using many SC skills frameworks, including business logistics management, T-shaped, expertise level, SCM skills and hard and soft skills. The proposed skills framework included skills related to business, logistics, management, and ethics and environment. Emerging skills such as the application of blockchain technology, big data and SC sustainability have been included in the framework.
   Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a guide to SC managers about which skills groups to focus on and advises a contingency-based approach to identify the relevant skills per group in line with organisational requirements.

AB Purpose There is a lot of interest in blockchain technology in the supply chain, but to date, there is little empirical research to support managerial decision-making. Verhoeven et al. (2018) suggested five screens for ensuring mindful development of use cases for blockchain in the supply chain. This paper aims to extend the Verhoeven et al.'s (2018) framework and empirical research beyond the use case stage into the pilot stage. Design/methodology/approach Three case studies in different industries (logistics services, consumer products and retail), supply chain positions (manufacturer, carrier, and retailer) and geographies (Europe and USA) are conducted to explore lessons learned by early adopters of blockchain technology in the supply chain. Findings The case studies indicate that the Verhoeven et al.'s (2018) screens, with one added screen, are helpful in considering "what to adopt." Based on the insights from the case studies, it is also possible to develop pilot design considerations that can inform "where to start." Lessons learned include that there is value in scoping pilots in a targeted manner, including the use of existing technology in the pilot (as opposed to replacing existing technology) and that there is the ability to start a pilot fast, provided the existence of executive and stakeholder engagement. Practical implications - In addition to the need to be being mindful in considering what use case for blockchain in the supply chain to potentially adopt, mindful consideration of blockchain technology in the supply chain extends into the design of pilots. Six specific design considerations are offered. Originality/value Based on the insights from early adopters in industry, the author extends guidance for the mindful adoption of blockchain in the supply chain beyond the development of use cases, into the design of actual pilots. These insights directly address calls for research from literature (including from Dobrovnik et al., 2018 and Ferdows, 2018).

TI Compacting ciphertext in multi-channel broadcast encryption and
   attribute-based encryption
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Broadcast encryption; Multi-channel broadcast encryption;
   Attribute-based encryption
ID CONSTANT SIZE CIPHERTEXTS; SCHEME; SECURE
AB Multi-channel broadcast encryption (MCBE) and Attribute-based encryption (ABE) are important primitives used in a broad range of concrete application scenarios such as Pay-TV, e-Health, Cloud Storage, Blockchain and so on. The former allows a sender to efficiently send different messages to arbitrarily chosen sets of users (target sets) at the same time, while the latter supports more sophisticated access control by allowing both the encryption and decryption phases to be based on the user's attributes.
   Recently, Canard el al. at Theoretical Computer Science'18 proposed a new technique for compacting header size in both MCBE and ABE. However, their technique leads to schemes in secret-key setting which has limited applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a new technique also for compacting header size in both MCBE and ABE, but our technique leads to schemes in public key setting which therefore can overcome the weakness mentioned above of the Canard el al.'s technique. We finally implement our MCBE and ABE schemes to give some concrete benchmarks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Money's materiality produces an ontological conundrum for social theory: should the analysis of money foreground the objects used as money, or the abstract relations that underpin it? Provoked by the emergence of cryptocurrencies, this paper develops a conceptualization of money as a technological and social infrastructure which directly addresses this theoretical impasse. Cryptocurrencies' sole form of material existence coincides with their underpinning infrastructure of records, accounting and payments. In the past decade, cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in number, and they have been applied to a host of use cases. This paper focuses on cross-border payments through the example of the fintech company Ripple, the cryptocurrency XRP, and the design of the XRP Ledger. Combining literatures from the social theory of money, science and technology studies and new materialisms, this article develops steps towards an ecological conceptualization of money infrastructures. Infrastructures, understood ecologically, include devices, active forms, and imaginaries in seamless webs of mutual relations of co-evolution. These ecologies are always potentially prone to slippage, dissolution, disassembling, reassembling and reappropriation, dependence, and competition.

TI Examining the Potential of Blockchain Technology to Meet the Needs of
   21st-Century Japanese Health Care: Viewpoint on Use Cases and Policy
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE information storage and retrieval; blockchain; Japan; aging; health
   informatics; health policy; global health
AB Japan is undergoing a major population health transition as its society ages, and it continues to experience low birth rates. An aging Japan will bring new challenges to its public health system, highlighted as a model for universal health coverage (UHC) around the world. Specific challenges Japan's health care system will face include an increase in national public health expenditures, higher demand for health care services, acute need for elder and long-term care, shortage of health care workers, and disparities between health care access in rural versus urban areas. Blockchain technology has the potential to address some of these challenges, but only if a health blockchain is conceptualized, designed, localized, and deployed in a way that is compatible with Japan's centralized UHC-centric public health system. Blockchain solutions must also be adaptive to opportunities and barriers unique to Japan's national health and innovation policy, including its regulatory sandbox system, while also seeking to learn from blockchain adoption in the private sector and in other countries. This viewpoint outlines the major opportunities and potential challenges to blockchain adoption for the future of Japan's health care.

AB We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries-cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals-and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies' capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability.

ID AUTHENTICATION
AB With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data, Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) are increasingly demanding data security, while cloud storage solves the storage problem of complex medical data. However, it is difficult to realize data security sharing. The decentralization feature of blockchain is helpful to solve the problem that the secure authentication process is highly dependent on the trusted third party and implement data security transmission. In this paper, the blockchain technology is used to describe the security requirements in authentication process, and a network model of MCPS based on blockchain is proposed. Through analysis of medical data storage architecture, it can ensure that data can't be tampered and untrackable. In the security authentication phase, bilinear mapping and intractable problems can be used to solve the security threat in the authentication process of medical data providers and users. It can avoid the credibility problem of the trusted third party, and also can realize the ?thyc=10?>two-way authentication between the hospital and blockchain node. Then, BAN logic is used to analyze security protocols, and formal analysis and comparison of security protocols are also made. The results show that the MCPS based on blockchain not only realizes medical treatment data sharing, but also meet the various security requirements in the security authentication phase. In addition, the storage and computing overhead costs is ideal. Therefore, the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure sharing of medical big data.

TI Adoption of Blockchain Technology in the Australian Grains Trade: An

DE Australia; Blockchain; general equilibrium modelling; grains trade;
   productivity
AB Recent analysis of Blockchain use has highlighted considerable potential productivity gains arising from lower transaction costs between buyers and sellers of goods. This has been shown by recent examples of Blockchain use in the Australian grains sector. In this paper, we have further developed and quantified this concept of productivity gain by undertaking several illustrative scenarios using a general equilibrium model of the global economy. Our analysis indicates that an assumed modest growth (five per cent) in productivity due to Blockchain use in the grains sector could raise output by eight per cent over the medium term. If this is accompanied by Blockchain use in the Australian finance sector, grains output could reach ten per cent. This reflects the effect of reduction in transaction costs due to the use of Blockchain technology as a "distributed ledger technology" in grain trading. Further, it is anticipated that the wider effects of Blockchain-driven productivity enhancement of the Australian finance sector could contribute to approximately 2.5 per cent increase in GDP in the medium term, relative to what would otherwise be.

SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE

DT Review
ID PATIENT-CENTERED CARE
AB The lack of interoperability in Britain's medical records systems precludes the realisation of benefits generated by increased spending elsewhere in healthcare. Growing concerns regarding the security of online medical data following breaches, and regarding regulations governing data ownership, mandate strict parameters in the development of efficient methods to administrate medical records. Furthermore, consideration must be placed on the rise of connected devices, which vastly increase the amount of data that can be collected in order to improve a patient's long-term health outcomes. Increasing numbers of healthcare systems are developing Blockchain-based systems to manage medical data. A Blockchain is a decentralised, continuously growing online ledger of records, validated by members of the network. Traditionally used to manage cryptocurrency records, distributed ledger technology can be applied to various aspects of healthcare. In this manuscript, we focus on how Electronic Medical Records in particular can be managed by Blockchain, and how the introduction of this novel technology can create a more efficient and interoperable infrastructure to manage records that leads to improved healthcare outcomes, while maintaining patient data ownership and without compromising privacy or security of sensitive data.

AB Blockchain technology is a technology that can effectively support supply chain transparency. An important initial managerial activity is for organisations in supply chains to evaluate and select the most suitable blockchain technology. However, uncertainty and emphasis on sustainable transparency has made this appraisal more complex. This paper: (1) introduces blockchain technology performance measures incorporating various sustainable supply chain transparency and technical attributes; and (2) introduces a new hybrid group decision method, integrated hesitant fuzzy set and regret theory, for blockchain technology evaluation and selection. This method emphasises decision maker psychological characteristics and variation in decision maker opinions. An illustrative application and sensitivity analysis is introduced to aid supply chain managers and researchers understand the blockchain technology selection decision. Methodological and managerial implications associated with the decision tool and application are introduced. This research sets the foundation for significant future research in blockchain technologies evaluation in a supply chain environment.

SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL

DT Article
DE Money laundering; Blockchain; Financial inclusion; Bank verification

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the anti-money laundering measures of the UK and Nigeria, to determine what the best approach is. The best approach is likely the one that strikes a fair balance between protecting the financial system against money laundering and promoting financial inclusion.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper relies mainly on primary and secondary data drawn from the public domain. It also relies on documentary research.
   Findings
   This paper critically analysed the anti-money laundering measures of the UK and Nigeria to determine that the anti-money laundering measures of Nigeria does not strike a fair balance between protecting the financial system against money laundering and promoting financial inclusion because it does not expressly provide for verification of a customer's identity at the account opening stage for low risk accounts. The paper, however, determined that the anti-money laundering measures of the UK does strike a fair balance between protecting the financial system against money laundering and promoting financial inclusion because it requires customer identification and verification before the establishment of a business relationship for customers who want to open a basic bank account.
   Originality/value
   This paper offers a critical analysis of the anti-money laundering and financial inclusion measures of the UK and Nigeria as provided in the UK's Payment Accounts Regulations 2015 and the Central Bank of Nigeria's (Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism in Banks and Other Financial Institutions in Nigeria) Regulations, 2013. The paper will provide recommendations on how the measures could be strengthened. This is the only article to adopt this kind of approach.

TI Blockchain Technology: Principles and Applications in Medical Imaging
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Smart contract; Disruptive technology
AB Blockchain is an immutable, encrypted, distributed ledger technology. While initially devised for and most commonly referenced with cryptocurrencies, there are an increasing number of applications outside finance, many of which are relevant to medical imaging. In this paper, the concepts and principles underlying the technology and applications relevant to medical imaging are discussed, in addition to potential challenges with implementations such as public versus private key access, distributed ledger size constraints, speed, complexity, and security pitfalls. Potential use cases for blockchain specifically relevant to medical imaging include image sharing including direct patient ownership of images, tracking of implanted medical devices, research, teleradiology, and artificial intelligence. While blockchain offers exciting ways to facilitate the storage and distribution of medical images, similar to the advent of picture archiving and communication systems decades ago, it does have several key limitations of which healthcare providers of medical imaging and imaging informatics professionals should be aware.

   immutability
AB The widespread adoption of the new generation of decentralised architectures, leveraged by blockchain and decentralised file storage (DFS) systems, enables a myriad of new applications and opportunities. Nevertheless, their remarkable features, namely auditability, availability and, among all, immutability, do not come without a cost. In this article, we examine blockchain and the most widely used DFS systems and discuss their main challenges and opportunities, with special regard to their immutability and its impact on their GDPR compliance. A description of current and prospective threats is also provided, along with an analysis of the features that each threat exploits. In addition, we discuss several measures to address the identified threats, and we provide a fertile common ground for further research.

AB Electronic medical data have significant advantages over paper-based patient records when it comes to storage and retrieval. However, most existing medical data sharing schemes have security risks, such as being prone to data tampering and forgery, and do not support the ability to verify the authenticity of the data source. To solve these problems, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on attribute cryptosystem and blockchain technology in this paper. First, the encrypted medical data are stored in the cloud, and the storage address and medical-related information are written into the blockchain, which can ensure efficient storage and eliminate the possibility of irreversible modification of the data. Second, the proposed scheme combines attribute-based encryption (ABE) and attribute-based signature (ABS), which achieves the sharing of medical data in many-to-many communications. The ABE achieves data privacy and fine-grained access control, and the ABS verifies the authenticity of the source of the medical data while protecting the signer & x2019;s identity. Moreover, the data user outsources most of the operations of medical data ciphertext decryption to the cloud service provider (CSP), which can greatly reduce the computational burden. Finally, results of the analysis show that our scheme satisfies the requirements for confidentiality and unforgeability in the random oracle model, and that the proposed scheme offers higher computational performance than other similar schemes.

AB Wireless traffic produced by modern mobile devices displays high temporal and spatial dynamics as users spontaneously engage in collective applications where a significant portion of generated data remains localized. As a result, conventional service provisioning approaches may no longer be sufficient in beyond fifth generation (B5G) systems. The challenge of increased dynamics on the access networks can be mitigated with moving cells. However, the deployment time of these temporary serving entities may lag behind the service demand lifetime. Another viable solution to offload excessive cellular traffic is to rely upon locally available radio resources offered by user devices via direct mmWave-based mesh interworking. An important challenge in such systems is related to the incentivization of users to partake in collaborative resource sharing. To leverage multi-hop mesh capabilities, we propose the use of emerging blockchain technology that offers cryptographically-strong accounting while maintaining the anonymity of the participants. With system-level evaluations, we demonstrate that the utilization of mobile blockchain methods allows for a non-incremental improvement in the offloading gains. This demonstrates the potential of the outlined proposal for becoming a successful mechanism in the emerging B5G systems.

AB Traditional centralized access control has some shortcomings in robustness, trustworthiness and circulation. Blockchains have the advantages of fault tolerance and trust. Smart contracts have the characteristics of automatic execution and flexible expansion. Tokens can well record credential information and transfer easily. In this paper, blockchain, smart contract and token are integrated and applied to access control to solve the shortcomings of traditional access control. First, access control, blockchain, smart contract and token are briefly described. Second, this paper proposes a solution by giving the general data structure of access control token, elaborating the equivalence, split, merge and verification algorithms of access control token, and explaining the system architecture of token-based access control. Last, this paper uses a token-based access control simulation system to verify that token-based access control has certain comparative advantages in robustness, trustworthiness, circulation, concurrency and so on.

AB Modern industry <italic>4.0</italic> applications are shifting towards decentralized automation of computing and cyber-physical systems (CPS), which necessitates building a robust, secure, and efficient system that performs complex interactions with other physical processes. To handle complex interactions in CPS, trust and consensus among various stakeholders is a prime concern. In a similar direction, consensus algorithms in blockchain have evolved over the years that focus on building smart, robust, and secure CPS. Thus, it is imperative to understand the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of different consensus algorithms used in CPS. Many consensus algorithms exist in the literature with a specified set of functionalities, performance, and computing services. Motivated from these facts, in this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of existing state-of-the-art consensus mechanisms and highlight their strength and weaknesses in decentralized CPS applications. In the first part, we present the scope of the proposed survey and identify gaps in the existing surveys. Secondly, we present the review method and objectives of the proposed survey based on research questions that address the gaps in existing studies. Then, we present a solution taxonomy of decentralized consensus mechanisms for various CPS applications. Then, open issues and challenges are also discussed in deploying various consensus mechanisms in the CPS with their merits and demerits. The proposed survey will act as a road-map for blockchain developers and researchers to evaluate and design future consensus mechanisms, which helps to build an efficient CPS for industry <italic>4.0</italic> stakeholders.

AB Since the awakening of Bitcoin, the terms 'blockchain', 'cryptocurrencies' have become the buzz words. Cryptocurrencies were thought to be very promising and boomed feverously in the hope that it might be capable of replacing the traditional currency. On this background, the paper has following objectives: 1) to compare the fiat money with cryptocurrency; 2) to study the potential of cryptocurrency of being capable of replacing the fiat money; 3) to propose the framework to evaluate the sustainability of the possible candidates to be the dominating currency. The researchers have applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to derive ratio scales from paired comparisons and rated the expected performances for two alternatives. Nine factors were selected with the hierarchical structure to measure the relative performance of proposed candidates. The results found that fiat money is still preferred to cryptocurrency due to many reasons.

AB There exist many different electronic voting solutions and each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Most of the existing systems suffer from inadequate transparency and auditability. However, recently introduced blockchain technology may provide a solution to these problems. In this paper, auditable blockchain voting system (ABVS) is presented. It combines existing voting approach and combines it with blockchain technology to create a supervised and remote internet voting system, which is transparent and audit capable. The paper describes the system's processes, components, model and results of initial testing.

AB In recent years, various food-safety issues have aroused public concern regarding safety in the food supply chain. Since grains are closely linked to human life and health, it is necessary to effectively manage information in the grain supply chain. The grain supply chain is characterized by a long life cycle, complex links, various hazards, and heterogeneous information sources. Problems with traditional traceability systems include easy data tampering, difficult hazardous-material information management, the "information isolated island'' problem, and low traceability efficiency in the whole supply chain. Blockchain is a distributed computing paradigm characterized by decentralization, network-wide recording, security, and reliability. As such, it can reduce administrative costs and improve the efficiency of information management. Based on literature research and a field investigation of wheat-processing enterprises in Shandong Province, We analyze the operation process of grain supply chain. This study, therefore, proposed a new system architecture in the entire grain supply chain based on blockchain technology and designed a multimode storage mechanism that combines chain storage. This prototype system was tested and verified using actual cases and application scenarios. Compared to traditional systems, the proposed system is characterized by data security and reliability, information interconnection and intercommunication, real-time sharing of hazardous-material information, and dynamic and credible whole-process tracing. As such, this system is highly significant and has reference value for guaranteeing food quality and safety-process traceability.

TI MIN: Co-Governing Multi-Identifier Network Architecture and Its

AB IP protocol is the core of TCP/IP network layer. However, since IP address and its Domain Name are allocated and managed by a single agency, there are risks of centralization. The semantic overload of IP address also reduces its scalability and mobility, which further hinders the security. This paper proposes a co-governing Multi-Identifier Network (MIN) architecture that constructs a network layer with parallel coexistence of multiple identifiers, including identity, content, geographic information, and IP address. On the management plane, we develop an efficient management system using consortium blockchain with voting consensus, so the network can simultaneously manage and support by hundreds or thousands of nodes with high throughput. On the data plane, we propose an algorithm merging hash table and prefix tree (HTP) for FIB, which avoids the false-negative error and can inter-translate different identifiers with tens of billions of entries. Further, we propose a scheme to transport IP packets using CCN as a tunnel for supporting progressive deployment. We deployed the prototype of MIN to the largest operators' network in Mainland China, Hongkong and Macao, and demonstrated that the network can register identifier under co-governing consensus algorithm, support VoD service very well.

AB Existing work in energy demand side management focuses on the interaction between the utility grid and consumers. However, the previous technique is not focused on energy trading in local community of a renewable energy generation, distributed demand side management and not suitable for real-time environment. This paper presents a distributed demand side management system among multiple homes in community microgrid, with the integration of the internet of things smart meter and in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed energy consumption game is formulated for minimizing the cost of electricity in the individual home and the total cost of energy consumption in the whole community. The smart home users are playing game by optimizing their own daily energy consumption of appliances. The multiple participants include the self renewable generation of users, shared community microgrid and optional utility company. Each participant applies its best strategy to minimize energy consumption cost and users can maintain their own privacy of energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed scheme is distributed on blockchain, which provides a trusted communication medium between the participants. It enforces the autonomous monitoring of smart appliances and the billing of electricity consumption via smart contracts. Solidity smart contract is deployed to facilitate the execution of transactions without the involvement of third party in the smart community. Comparison of the results show that the proposed approach minimizes the total cost of energy consumption as well as each user's energy consumption cost.

AB Local energy generation and peer to peer (P2P) energy trading in the local market can reduce the energy consumption cost, emission of harmful gases (as renewable energy sources are used to generate energy at user's premises) and increase the smart grid resilience. However, local energy trading with peers can have trust and privacy issues. A centralized system can be used to manage this energy trading but it increases the overall cost of the system and also faces several issues. In this paper, to implement a hybrid P2P energy trading market, a blockchain-based system is proposed. It is fully decentralized and allows the market members to interact with each other and trade energy without involving a third party. Smart contracts play a very important role in the blockchain-based energy trading market. They contain all the necessary rules for energy trading. We have proposed three smart contracts to implement the hybrid electricity trading market. The market members interact with the main smart contract, which requests P2P and prosumer to grid smart contracts for further processing. The main objectives of this paper are to propose a model to implement an efficient hybrid energy trading market while reducing cost and peak to average ratio of electricity.

AB Applications of Blockchain (BC) technology and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasing exponentially. However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed. Finally, a case study of retail marketing is presented, which uses AI and SC to preserve its security and privacy.

AB With the public key being the parameter users are mostly addressed by on blockchain network, an intruder can connect transactional patterns to the public key and make a probable revelation of the identity of the user. Due to the diversity in approaches in achieving privacy, integrating the principle of transparency in any blockchain & x2013; edge computing platform will present some structural security challenges. Thus, an attempt should be made to achieve confidentiality whilst not eliminating a key principle of blockchain & x2013; transparency. Based on elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC), we present a privacy-aware scheme that preserves the privacy details of the user in a blockchain & x2013;edge computing environment based on a combination of randomly generated public keys and digital signatures. The resilience and practicality of our scheme were tested on AVISPA and NS2 respectively. The results indicated our scheme was robust against attacks, efficient and low on computation resources of edge devices.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is treated as an extension of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication network. IoV helps in enhancing driving aids with the help of vehicle Artificial Intelligence (AI) awareness of other vehicles and their actions. IoV is connected in an adhoc networking environment which utilizes each vehicle in the network as a node, called Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), where the vehicles may be also connected to the public Internet. It is specifically important for the autonomous vehicles because they can instantaneously communicate with other vehicles surrounding them. In addition, safely avoiding accident prone zones is crucial in order to continue secure and smart transportation. Since the communication among various entities involved in the IoV environment is via open channel, it gives an opportunity to a passive/active adversary to intercept, modify, delete or even insert fake information during communication. It is then a serious concern for the vehicles users to determine whether the received information is genuine. In this survey paper, various security aspects, threats and attacks, network and threat models related to the IoV environment are discussed. Next, a taxonomy of security protocols is given that is essential to provide IoV data security. In particular, focus on various authentication protocols is given that is needed for mutual authentication among the involved entities in the IoV environment for secure communication. A detailed comparative analysis among various state-of-art authentication protocols proposed in the related IoV environment is provided to show their effectiveness as well as security and functionality features. Moreover, some testbeds are described that were designed and implemented for the IoV environment. In addition, some future challenges for IoV security protocols are also highlighted that are necessary to address in the future.

AB This paper presents a decentralised and fast adaptive block chain's consensus algorithm with maximum voter privacy using wlan mesh network. The algorithm is suitable for consortium blockchain and private blockchain, and is written as a smart contract for Hyperledger Fabric. Unlike previously proposed blockchain's consensus protocols, this is the first implementation that does not rely on any trusted authority to compute the tally or to protect the voter's privacy. Instead, the algorithm is a fast adaptive protocol, and each voter is in control of the privacy of their own vote such that it can only be breached by a full collusion involving all other voters. The execution of the protocol is enforced using the consensus mechanism that also secures the Fabric blockchain. The implementation on Fabric's official test network is conducted to demonstrate its feasibility. Also, this paper provides a computational breakdown of its execution cost.

AB Currently, the migration fact of many transport enterprises to the Internet cloud has been noted, where the use of information technology is one of the factors for the active use of enterprise innovative potential, revealing new opportunity to increase revenue, improve efficiency and achieve better results. New concepts and terms have been developed with the emergence of the digital economy. Thus tariffs for transport services of enterprises engaged in international transport are replenished with new content. Introducing information systems, using an intelligent user interface, auto-indexed technological tools, transport companies strengthen their influence on international markets, increase volume of service export. Working with blockchain technology is not a particularly difficult task for transport enterprises. The use of the blockchain-based cryptocurrency mining mechanism to increase revenues encourages transport enterprises to improve their organizational structure, create IT departments, introduce new management methods and personnel remuneration systems without limitation to traditional approaches developed by practical activities. A topical issue in the study of cryptocurrency mining and closely related to the implementation of blockchain technology in the activities of transport enterprises remains the issue of the peculiarities forming the cost of services for an enterprise using blockchain technology. In the near future, artificial intelligence will become an indispensable tool for transport enterprises and service organizations. The rapid development of the digital economy and information technologies in the activity of transport enterprises will serve as the basis for formation of prerequisites for a transition to the V technological mode and development of market relations based on innovative technologies.

AB Blind signature has a wide range of applications in the fields of E-commerce and block-chain because it can effectively prevent the blind signer from getting the original message with its blindness. Owing to the potential unconditional security, quantum blind signature (QBS) is more advantageous than the classical ones. In this paper, an efficient and practical quantum blind signature scheme relaxed security model is presented, where quantum superposition, decoy qubits and hash function are used for the purpose of blindness. Compared with previous QBS scheme, the presented scheme is more efficient and practical with a relaxed security model, in which the signer's dishonest behavior can be detected other than being prevented as in other QBS schemes.

AB IoT-enable monitoring can provide valuable information for the shellfish quality evaluation during cold storage condition. However, IoT based information storage relies on the centralized platform, it is possible to tamper. In this paper, we establish blockchain based multi-sensors (WSN) monitoring system to collect quality parameters and verify captured information for improving transparency and trust during cold storage. The implementation of the K-means and SVM algorithms were used in quality evaluation applications to classify and predict the quality loss of frozen shellfish. The results show blockchain based WSN monitoring can achieve the dynamic indicators continuous monitoring and ensures the data security and reliability. The proportion of the training set and the test set in the allowable deviation range is 88.89% and 87.17%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of training set and test set are 0.1502 and 0.1793 by SVM model. The performance of the K-means and SVM model has higher accuracy than BP model. This paper could help to reduce the risk of food losses and improve quality and safety management of frozen shellfish during cold storage.

AB The concept of digital twin was originally proposed to assist product lifecycle management through the high-fidelity virtual product. In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method. The results show that the proposed method can solve the abovementioned data management problems simultaneously.

AB The aim of the research is to analyze the impact of modern digital technologies on the application of legal norms. In the article the question of the influence of modern digital technologies on law enforcement is considered from the standpoint of modern post-non-classical methodology, first of all, constructivism and anthropocentrism as directions of sociological jurisprudence. Law enforcement activity is investigated as part of the mechanism for the reproduction of law as an important element of the construction of social reality. It is shown that the subject of law enforcement activity, actions that are determined by many factors including legal consciousness, plays a determining role in law enforcement. Digitalization affects the individual and collective legal consciousness of the subjects of law enforcement, thereby affecting the nature and results of law enforcement activities. Digital reality also affects the existing system of values in society, which also inevitably affects law enforcement. The article also examines the impact of digital technologies on existing law enforcement procedures and on legal techniques. A significant change in these parameters is predicted due to the prospective emergence of digital law as a new, more flexible form of law. The digital law will become an interactive legal act, which has the ability to adjust to the requests of the subjects in specific legal relations. It will radically change the idea of legal technology, as it will be created with the help of digital crowdsourcing. At the same time, the application of the norms of digital law carries certain risks, which are also investigated in the article. Another important area of influence of digital technologies on law enforcement is associated with the automation and algorithmization of the legal sphere, as the introduction of digital technologies in the law enforcement process involves the use of robots and artificial intelligence. In this regard, the problems and risks of algorithmization of law and providing robots elements of legal personality are analyzed. The article concludes that modern digital technologies in general can change the importance of law in the system of regulators of public relations, and reduce the role of legal regulation and, as a consequence, the importance of law enforcement.

AB This paper explores a potential paradigm shift in trade finance utilizing blockchain technology. Traditionally, the centralized operating model has governed trade finance and the manner in which traders handle business processes. However, such heavy reliance on centralized authorities has made for poor performance, the lack of flexibility and transparency, and vulnerability to malicious alteration. The blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology (DLT), has attracted growing attention and has the potential to disrupt legacy finance procedures such as payment by letter of credit (L/C). International trade players may benefit from the technological reengineering of financial processes through the implementation of blockchain- and smart contract-based platforms. From the conceptual perspective of a paradigm shift, this study analyzes the feasibility of blockchain innovation in trade finance through modern blockchain-based L/C initiatives. Moreover, this study also explores blockchain applications in terms of logistics tracking and how it integrates with trade finance procedures. This study contributes to the understanding of a blockchain paradigm shift with a multi-case study. The results may illuminate the potential future application of blockchain finance and provide researchers with an illustrative example of other finance-related capabilities. Studies of trade-related topics such as customs clearances, insurance, and logistics applications need to be addressed in the future to create a comprehensively trustless environment and facilitate the automation of trade.

AB Next to climate change on the list of challenges faced by humankind in today's technological age is energy management. While "smart" ideas continue to gather momentum as some of the ways earmarked to combat the menace of a changing climate, coupled with efficient management of energy, research and development in the blockchain is not retracting, recently giving rise to digital currencies capable of fueling massive energy consumption via mining of "crypto-coins". Given that sustainability is a crucial goal in the design of smart cities nowadays, there are currently no assurances of sustainable cities where cryptocurrency mining is at full scale. Nevertheless, alternative energy sources may come to the rescue in no distant time. In this paper, we contextualize energy-use in smart cities through mining of virtual currencies, in order to predict whether or not smart cities can truly be sustainable if crypto-mining is sustained. An attempt is also made to emphasize the possible ways of reducing energy use and all activities involving digital currencies by seeking to replace "Proof of Work" (PoW) with improved alternatives.

AB The transition to digital economy based on new technologies becomes one of the main tools of innovative technological development in Russia. This research examines the means for implementing digital technologies that effectively enable rapid innovative development of the Russian economy. 1 hypothesise it is necessary to develop a methodological system of techniques and algorithms of artificial intelligence filling neural networks of digital technologies for managing finance in the conditions of uncertainty and risk. A wide variety of methods was used in the study, including dialectic and integrated approaches, fundamental economic laws, deductive and inductive methods, statistical comparisons, descriptive methods of analysis. Moreover, I apply such methodologies as the theory of constraints (TOC), methods of lean manufacturing, Kanban-methods as a tool of IT-management, scrum methodology for software development, and other. The statistical and empirical data confirm the validity of the conclusions and results. The paper considers how to create capital in the form of innovative products and technologies in the digital environment. As a result, the study has revealed relations between digital technologies and engineering account, economic analysis, material production, highly skilled creative work, environmental protection, and sustainable development. The article explains how to include automated information and analytical functions for the compensation and generation of missing information into digital technologies. The transition from the database to the knowledge base, which fills neural networks with the artificial intelligence, provides the generation of management decisions and sustainable innovative development in the conditions of uncertainty and risk. The paper recommends currencies for digital payments. I conclude that applying the suggested recommendations is necessary for providing digital technologies with the algorithms of extraction and implementation of knowledge from the data asset, as well as for compensating for the missing information, generating information flows, and making decisions in the conditions of uncertainty and risk. The research can be of use for PhD students, doctoral students, scholars and practitioners in the field of economy.

AB In the consensus protocols used in most cryptocurrencies, participants called miners must find valid blocks of transactions and append them to a shared tree-like data structure. Ideally, the rules of the protocol should ensure that miners maximize their gains if they follow a default strategy, which consists on appending blocks only to the longest branch of the tree, called the blockchain. Our goal is to understand under which circumstances are miners encouraged to follow the default strategy. Unfortunately, most of the existing models work with simplified payoff functions, without considering the possibility that rewards decrease over time because of the game rules (like in Bitcoin), nor integrating the fact that a miner naturally prefers to be paid earlier than later (the economic concept of discount). In order to integrate these factors, we consider a more general model where issues such as economic discount and decreasing rewards can be set as parameters of an infinite stochastic game. In this model, we study the limit situation in which a miner does not receive a full reward for a block if it stops being in the blockchain. We show that if rewards are not decreasing, then miners do not have incentives to create new branches, no matter how high their computational power is. On the other hand, when working with decreasing rewards similar to those in Bitcoin, we show that miners have an incentive to create such branches. Nevertheless, this incentive only occurs when a miner controls a proportion of the computational power which is close to half of the computational power of the entire network.

AB Blockchain is evolving to be a secure and reliable platform for secure data sharing in application areas such as the financial sector, supply chain management, food industry, energy sector, internet of things and healthcare. In this paper, we review existing literature and applications available for the healthcare system using blockchain technology. Besides, this work also proposes multiple workflows involved in the healthcare ecosystem using blockchain technology for better data management. Different medical workflows have been designed and implemented using the ethereum blockchain platform which involves complex medical procedures like surgery and clinical trials. This also includes accessing and managing a large amount of medical data. Within the implementation of the workflows of the medical smart contract system for healthcare management, the associated cost has been estimated for this system in terms of a feasibility study which has been comprehensively presented in this paper. This work would facilitate multiple stakeholders who are involved within the medical system to deliver better healthcare services and optimize cost.

AB In order to realize the understanding of expected returns after issuance of blockchain new currency initial coin offerings (ICO) and maximize investment returns, in this study, the Semantic Orientation Pointwise Mutual Information (SO-PMI) algorithm is used to create a customer emotional dictionary of blockchain new currency, and collect users' online comments based on blockchain currency before ICO. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to construct an evaluation model, analyze and judge users' comments, make accurate prediction of the expected return of ICO issuing new currency, improve investment operations, and maximize the return of investment. The results show that the combination of the SO-PMI and SVM algorithms can accurately evaluate the price after the issuance of new currency, and then realize the judgment of expected return and obtain the expected return of investment. It can be seen that the combination of algorithms based on data-mining technology is applied to the study of the expected return of new currency issuance in blockchain, which achieves the goal of revenue anticipation and greatly reduces the investment risk of new currency issuance in blockchain.

ID SECURITY
AB Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have several security issues such as privacy preservation, secure authentication, and system reliability. In the VANET, a vehicle communicates with other vehicles or infrastructures using broadcasting messages. These messages contain not only normal traffic information, but also identification information of sender. In general, the identification information remains encrypted to ensure privacy. However, the conventional centralized system can decrypt the identification information using private information of the sender vehicle. As a result, the central server can often be targeted by adversaries. We propose a message authentication scheme for anonymity and decentralization of information using blockchain technology. Here, we introduce public-private key and message authentication code (MAC) for secure authentication. In this paper, we adopt consensus algorithms for composing blockchain system such as the proof of work (PoW) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) into the proposed authentication process. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method is secure from the attacks which include impersonation from internal attacker as well as typical attacks.

AB Context: Smart Energy is a disruptive concept that has led to the emergence of new energy policies, technology projects, and business models. The development of those models is driven by world capitals, companies, and universities. Their purpose is to make the electric power system more efficient through distributed energy generation/storage, smart meter installation, or reduction of consumption/implementation costs. This work approaches Smart Energy as a paradigm that is concerned with systemic strategies involving the implementation of innovative technological developments in energy systems. However, many of the challenges encountered under this paradigm are yet to be overcome, such as the effective integration of solutions within Smart Energy systems. Edge Computing is included in this new technology group. Objective: To investigate developments that involve the use of Edge Computing and that provide solutions to Smart Energy problems. The research work will be developed using the methodology of systematic mapping of literature, following the guidelines established by Kitchenham and Petersen that facilitate the identification of studies published on the subject. Results: Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied to identify the relevant articles. We selected 80 papers that were classified according to the type of publication (journal, conferences, or book chapter), type of research (conceptual, experience, or validation), type of activity (implement, validate, analyze) and asset (architecture, framework, method, or models). Conclusion: A complete review has been conducted of the 80 articles that were closely related to the questions posed in this research. To reach the goal of building Edge Computing architectures for Smart Energy environments, several lines of research have been defined. In the future, such architectures will overcome current problems, becoming highly energy-efficient, cost-effective, and capacitated to process and respond in real-time.

AB The serious problem of climate change has led the energy sector to modify its generation resources from fuel-based power plants to environmentally friendly renewable resources. However, these green resources are highly intermittent due to weather dependency and they produce increased risks of stability issues in power systems. The deployment of different flexible resources can help the system to become more resilient and secure against uncertainties caused by renewables. Flexible resources can be located at different levels in power systems like, for example, at the transmission-level (TSO), distribution-level (DSO) and customer-level. Each of these levels may have different structures of flexibility trading as well. This paper conducts a comprehensive review from the recent research related to flexible resources at various system levels in smart grids and assesses the trading structures of these resources. Finally, it analyzes the application of a newly emerged ICT technology, blockchain, in the context of flexibility trading.

AB With the rapid development of the economy, the competition in the animal product industry is no longer a competition among individual enterprises, but depends on the improvement of the operational efficiency of the entire animal product supply chain. However, the existing system still has the following disadvantages: the rights are too concentrated, the supply chain it is difficult to generate trust between nodes, and system maintenance personnel may maliciously tamper with the data, which may cause regulatory difficulties. The participating entities cannot verify whether their data is properly used; fail to find a reasonable balance between information sharing and privacy protection. Chain owners have doubts about privacy issues. Based on the above background, the purpose of this paper is to optimize the supply chain of animal products through the blockchain. This paper analyzes the problems existing in the supply chain of animal products in China, and constantly improves the production, circulation, of animal products with the investment of technologies such as "blockchain". The external environment in the process, using the open and transparent, non-tamperable characteristics of the blockchain to provide consumers with traceability services, to ensure that every link in the supply chain is in a controllable range, from the slaughterhouse to the table. Traceable query system to ensure product quality. Based on the traceability mechanism of blockchain technology, the loss rate of animal products can be reduced to 0.18, and the reliability can be increased to 0.825. After optimization of supply chain, it not only meets market demand, but also promotes the development of animal products in a more stable direction.

AB Demand response (DR) in the smart grid will promote the stable operation of the power system and reduce economic costs effectively. However, uncertainty of users' behavior becomes a barrier of DR, in which the credibility between the DR users and aggregators will have a crucial impact on the DR. Blockchain is a new technology to solve the trust problem without third-party endorsement, which has the advantages of decentralization and irreversibility. Considering the difference of computing capability between users and aggregators, this article proposes a blockchain-based strategy to support the bidirectional selection between DR users and aggregators based on reputation values, which improves the success rate of the DR and mitigates the impact of user behavior on the DR. At the same time, this strategy can also increase the enthusiasm of users with a high reputation value to participate in DR. Using the network topology and DR incentive rules of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, the rationality of blockchain-based reliable interoperation for DR entities proposed in this paper is verified.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) constitute one of the most promising third-millennium technologies and have wide range of applications in our surrounding environment. The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. Hence, the security of IoT should start with foremost securing WSNs ahead of the other components. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e., there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. More specifically, for the application areas in which CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) has prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: "Passive Attacks" and "Active Attacks". Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.

AB Modern cyber physical systems (CPSs) has widely being used in our daily lives because of development of information and communication technologies (ICT). With the provision of CPSs, the security and privacy threats associated to these systems are also increasing. Passive attacks are being used by intruders to get access to private information of CPSs. In order to make CPSs data more secure, certain privacy preservation strategies such as encryption, and k-anonymity have been presented in the past. However, with the advances in CPSs architecture, these techniques also need certain modifications. Meanwhile, differential privacy emerged as an efficient technique to protect CPSs data privacy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of differential privacy techniques for CPSs. In particular, we survey the application and implementation of differential privacy in four major applications of CPSs named as energy systems, transportation systems, healthcare and medical systems, and industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Furthermore, we present open issues, challenges, and future research direction for differential privacy techniques for CPSs. This survey can serve as basis for the development of modern differential privacy techniques to address various problems and data privacy scenarios of CPSs.

AB With the integration of highly permeable renewable energy to the grid at different levels (transmission, distribution and grid-connected), the volatility on both sides (source side and load side) leading to bidirectional power flow in the power grid complicates the control mechanism. In order to ensure the real-time power balance, energy exchange, higher energy utilization efficiency and stability maintenance in the electric power system, this paper proposes an integrated application of blockchain technology on energy routers at transmission and distribution networks with increased renewable energy penetration. This paper focuses on the safe and stable operation of a highly penetrated renewable energy grid-connected power system and its operation. It also demonstrates a blockchain-based negotiation model with weakly centralized scenarios for "source-network-load" collaborative scheduling operations; secondly, the QoS (quality of service) index of energy flow control and energy router node doubly-fed stability control model were designed. Further, it also introduces the MOPSO (multi-objective particle swarm optimization) algorithm for power output optimization of multienergy power generation; Thirdly, based on the blockchain underlying architecture and load prediction value constraints, this paper puts forward the optimization mechanism and control flow of autonomous energy coordination of b2u (bottom-up) between router nodes of transmission and distribution network based on blockchain.

AB Integration of renewable energy and optimization of energy use are key enablers of sustainable energy transitions and mitigating climate change. Modern technologies such the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a wide number of applications in the energy sector, i.e, in energy supply, transmission and distribution, and demand. IoT can be employed for improving energy efficiency, increasing the share of renewable energy, and reducing environmental impacts of the energy use. This paper reviews the existing literature on the application of IoT in in energy systems, in general, and in the context of smart grids particularly. Furthermore, we discuss enabling technologies of IoT, including cloud computing and different platforms for data analysis. Furthermore, we review challenges of deploying IoT in the energy sector, including privacy and security, with some solutions to these challenges such as blockchain technology. This survey provides energy policy-makers, energy economists, and managers with an overview of the role of IoT in optimization of energy systems.

AB To promote coordinated development of electric vehicles (EVs) and power grid under open power selling, a bidding mechanism using blockchain smart contract technology was proposed. By demand respone management (DRM) on and off the blockchain, based on different driving characteristics of EV subgroups, various charging-discharging demands and constraints were fully considered between EV user subgroups and agent. Purchase-sale transaction relationship and unit commitment plan were fully considered between the EV agent and power dispatching center under economic dispatching. Aiming at the lowest power purchase cost of EV users, the highest profit of EV agent and the lowest cost of power economic dispatching, smart contract models with optimal benefits were established among the three. The smart contract models were solved by combining the internal and external optimization relationship of particle swarm and genetic algorithms. The charging-discharging price was optimized by DRM to realize the reasonable allocation of charging-discharging resources of EVs. An example analysis shows that this bidding mechanism can achieve peak-cutting and valley-filling for power load. At the same time, it can effectively protect the benefits of EV users, agent, and power dispatching center. This result can provide a reference for the application of smart contract in bidding of EVs to the power grid.

AB In this paper, a Blockchain-driven platform for supply chain finance, BCautoSCF (Zhi-lian-che-rong in Chinese), is introduced. It is successfully established as a reliable and efficient financing platform for the auto retail industry. Due to the Blockchain built-in trust mechanism, participants in the supply chain (SC) networks work extensively and transparently to run a reliable, convenient, and traceable business. Likewise, the traditional supply chain finance (SCF), partial automation of SCF workflows with fewer human errors and disruptions was achieved through smart contract in BCautoSCF. Such open and secure features suggest the feasibility of BCautoSCF in SCF. As the first Blockchain-driven SCF application for the auto retail industry in China, our contribution lies in studying these pain points existing in traditional SCF and proposing a novel Blockchain-driven design to reshape the business logic of SCF to develop an efficient and reliable financing platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the auto retail industry to decrease the cost of financing and speed up the cash flows. Currently, there are over 600 active enterprise users that adopt BCautoSCF to run their financing business. Up to October 2019, the BCautoSCF provides services to 449 online/offline auto retailors, three B2B asset exchange platforms, nine fund providers, and 78 logistic services across 21 provinces in China. There are 3296 financing transactions successfully completed in BCautoSCF, and the amount of financing is yen566,784,802.18. In the future, we will work towards supporting a full automation of SCF workflow by smart contracts, so that the efficiency of transaction will be further improved.

ID DESIGN
AB Prior studies have already predicted that enforcement of IP on the additive manufacturing industry will not be successful due to the widespread use of file-sharing technologies, similar to the entertainment and music industry. This paper discusses the capabilities of Blockchain technology for protecting IP in the design and manufacturing area. A conceptual framework for a digital platform is defined in this paper and further, a survey study of engineering design and manufacturing students has been conducted to identify, the main motivation behind developing these platforms and the types of features that should be included in Blockchain-based IP platforms for asset protection, particularly for product design. In addition, respondents provided their opinions about the type of industry that might be affected more by the threat of counterfeiting products and the role of Blockchain-based IP systems on the growth and development of innovation.

AB With the modern age of using genetically engineered products and growing concerns aboutfood recalls and outbreaks, businesses are looking for ways to secure their brand names and assuring consumers aboutfood safety and quality. Recently, Blockchain has been introduced as a promising approach for increasing the visibility of the supply chain and reducing the sale of contaminated and counterfeit products. Along this line, this study discusses the capabilities ofBlockchain for the collection and monitoring ofproduct lifecycle information ranging from production, wholesale, and logistics to standards, business reputation, and certification. The particular focus of the study is to discuss the use ofvideogrammetry as a data collection mechanism for bringing the product lifecycle data on digital Blockchain platforms and solving the "last mile" problem and data verification issue on Blockchain platforms. A conceptual example of organic meat processing is discussed to describe the proposedprocedure and show how videogrammetry in combination with RFID and fingerprints can be used to solve the data verification issue on Blockchain platforms.

AB In the last years, identity management solutions on blockchain were proposed as a possible solution to digital identity management problems. However, they are still at an early stage, and further research needs to be done to conclude whether identity systems could benefit from the use of blockchain or not. Motivated by this, we investigate blockchain-based identity management solutions to give the reader an overview of the current status and provide a better understanding of the pros and cons of using such solutions. We analyze ten of the most known implementations, with a focus on privacy and security aspects. Finally, we identify existing challenges and give new research directions.

AB Electronic healthcare (eHealth) identity management (IdM) is a pivotal feature in the eHealth system. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is an emerging technology that can achieve agreements of transactional data states in a decentralized way. Building identity management systems using Blockchain can enable patients to fully control their own identity and provide increased confidence in data immutability and availability. This paper presents the state of the art of decentralized identity management using Blockchain and highlights the possible opportunities for adopting the decentralized identity management approaches for future health identity systems. First, we summarize eHealth identity management scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the existing decentralized identity management solutions and present decentralized identity models. In addition, we discuss the current decentralized identity projects and identify new challenges based on the existing solutions and the limitations when applying it to healthcare as a particular use case.

ID PRESERVING AUTHENTICATION SCHEME
AB Air quality in urban environments has become a central issue of our present society as it affects the health and lives of the population all over the world. The first step in mitigating negative effects is proper measurement of the pollution level. This work presents a portable air pollution measurement system, built from off-the-shelf devices, that is designed to assure user privacy and data authenticity. Data is collected from sensor modules that can be hand carried or installed on vehicles, possibly leading to a vehicular sensor network that may cover a larger area. The main challenge is to provide authenticity for the sensor data while also ensuring user privacy. The proposed system assures authenticity and non-repudiation for the collected data by using group signatures and a blockchain-like structure for secure storage. We use regular key-exchange protocols based on elliptic curve cryptography in order to securely bootstrap a session key, then we benefit from secure tunneling to export data from sensors to the remote server. Post-update tampering is prevented by the use of a blockchain-like structure on the data server. We carry experiments both to determine the computational requirements of the procedures, as well as to measure indicators of air quality on nearby areas.

AB Developing Countries in Africa in general and Zambia in particular, have seen a rapid rise in use of mobile payment platforms. This has not only revolutionized access to finance for the poor but also allowed them access to other financial products such as savings or insurance. With a growing number of mobile money providers in Zambia, there is need for a solution that would enable integration of the mobile money provider's systems using a central clearinghouse for purposes of clearing and settlement to achieve mobile money interoperability. In this study, we first reviewed the technical landscape and features of mobile payment systems in Zambia and then assessed the feasibility of using blockchain technology in proposing a settlement and clearing system that would facilitate mobile money interoperability. A prototype system was then designed in which amounts being interchanged between providers are managed as assets on a permissioned blockchain. The system runs a distributed shared ledger, which provides non-repudiation, data privacy and data origin authentication, by leveraging the consistency features of blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain technology could be implemented not only in digital currency, but also in other fields. One such implementation is in democratic life, namely voting. This research focuses on designing a blockchain-based electronic voting system for medium to large-scale usage that complies with law, specifically voting principles in Indonesia. In this research, we proposed the following: a ballot design as block transaction employing UUID version 4, a modified block structure using SHA3-256 hash algorithm, and a voting protocol. The minimum length of a ballot is 43 bytes (excluding ECDSA signature) if one character is used as candidate's identifier and timestamp is stored as integer. We built a simulation program using Python-based Django web framework to cast 10,000 votes and mine them into blocks. Tampered transactions in each block could be detected and restored by synchronizing data with another node. We also evaluated the proposed system. By using this system, voters can exercise voting principles in Indonesia: direct, public, free, confidential, honest, and fair.

DT Article
DE Digital signature; Signature verification; Validity model; Blockchain;
   Timestamp
AB Digitally signed documents must remain stored for many years. In this paper, a scheme that would allow maintaining signature validity without the necessity to use timestamps from trusted third parties is proposed. According to the scheme, after inserting data into a blockchain, a user can store a signed document in his storage without the need to perform any maintenance actions in the future. The Round-based Blockchain Time-stamping Scheme is proposed that is scalable, i.e., it requires embedding a constant number of bytes into a blockchain independent from a number of input documents. The scheme allows to prove that a document existed not only before a certain date, but after a certain date as well. Moreover, the purpose of the scheme is to meet non-repudiation requirements for digitally signed documents. The scheme allows verifying signature validity using a chain model and under some conditions using a modified shell model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID KEY-FRAME EXTRACTION
AB The rapid development of multimedia technologies gave birth to large video data that demands effective and fast video summarization methods along with ability to assure the authenticity of digital data. Video summarization provides consolidated view of original video in short and compact form of a video. The summarized videos should be transmitted to remote IoT devices through secure channels. To prevent data manipulation and to verify the transmitted data, we exploited the blockchain technology. This paper focuses on different steps of keyframe extraction from a video followed by secure and trusted transmission to the consumers. The proposed system enables the users to summarize a video based on human and objects as parameters. Cryptographic hashes are used with blockchain, hashes are generated from summarized video blocks, signed and transmitted through blockchain. Cumulus blockchain technique is utilized to ensure the video integrity. System allows remote users to get tamper-proofed summarized video of their business sites or any sensitive premises on their smartphones. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cryptocurrency has gained considerable popularity in the past decade. The untraceable and uncontrolled nature of cryptocurrency attracts millions of people around the world. Research in cryptocurrency is dedicated to finding the ether and predicting its price according to the cryptocurrency's past price inflations. In this study, price prediction is performed with two machine learning methods, namely linear regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM), by using a time series consisting of daily ether cryptocurrency closing prices. Different window lengths are used in ether cryptocurrency price prediction by using filters with different weight coefficients. In the training phase, a cross-validation method is used to construct a high-performance model independent of the data set. The proposed model is implemented using two machine learning techniques. When using the proposed model, the SVM method has a higher accuracy (96.06%) than the LR method (85.46%). Furthermore, the accuracy score of the proposed model can be increased up to 99% by adding features to the SVM method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Compared with single cloud service providers, cloud exchange provides users with lower price and flexible options. However, conventional cloud exchange markets are suffering from a number of challenges such as central architecture being vulnerable to malicious attacks and cheating behaviours of third-party auctioneers. The recent advances in blockchain technologies bring the opportunities to overcome the limitations of cloud exchange. However, the integration of blockchain with cloud exchange is still in infancy and extensive research efforts are needed to tackle a number of research challenges. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an overview on using blockchain for cloud exchange. In particular, we first give an overview on cloud exchange. We then briefly survey blockchain technology and discuss the issues on using blockchain for cloud exchange in aspects of security, privacy, reputation systems and transaction management. Finally, we present the open research issues in this promising area. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI DCAP: A Secure and Efficient Decentralized Conditional Anonymous Payment
   System Based on Blockchain
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Decentralized conditional anonymous payment; blockchain; cryptocurrency;
   smart contract; anonymity; privacy; regulation
AB Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, can potentially be deployed in a wide range of applications. Among these applications, decentralized payment systems (e.g. Bitcoin) have been one of the most mature blockchain applications with widespread adoption. While the early designs (e.g. Bitcoin) are often the currency of choice by cybercriminals (e.g., in ransomware incidents), they only provide pseudo-anonymity, in the sense that anyone can deanonymize Bitcoin transactions by using information in the blockchain. To strengthen the privacy protection of decentralized payment systems, a number of solutions such as Monero and Zerocash have been proposed. However, completely Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) systems can be criminally exploited, for example in online extortion and money laundering activities. Recognizing the importance of regulation, we present a novel definition of Decentralized Conditional Anonymous Payment (DCAP) and describe the corresponding security requirements. In order to construct a concrete DCAP system, we first design a Condition Anonymous Payment (CAP) scheme (based on our proposed signature of knowledge), whose security can be demonstrated under the defined formal semantic and security models. To demonstrate utility, we compare the performance of our proposal with that of Zerocash under the same parameters and testing environment.

AB Mobile payment is a new payment method offering users mobility, reachability, compatibility, and convenience. But mobile payment involves great uncertainty and risk given its electronic and wireless nature. Therefore, biometric authentication has been adopted widely in mobile payment in recent years. However, although technology requirements for secure mobile payment have been met, standards and consistent requirements of user authentication in mobile payment are not available. The flow management of user authentication in mobile payment is still at its early stage. Accordingly, this paper proposes an anonymous authentication and management flow for mobile payment to support secure transaction to prevent the disclosure of users' information and to reduce identity theft. The proposed management flow integrates transaction key generation, encryption and decryption, and matching to process users' personal information and biometric characteristics based on mobile equipment authentication carrier.

AB This paper presents a literature review about the application of blockchain-based systems in transportation. The main aim was to identify, through the implementation of a multi-step methodology: current research-trends, main gaps in the literature, and possible future challenges. First, a bibliometric analysis was carried out to obtain a broad overview of the topic of interest. Subsequently, the most influential contributions were analysed in depth, with reference to the following two areas: supply chain and logistics; road traffic management and smart cities. The most important result is that the blockchain technology is still in an early stage, but appears extremely promising, given its possible applications within multiple fields, such as food track and trace, regulatory compliance, smart vehicles' security, and supply-demand matching. Much effort is still necessary for reaching the maturation stage because several models have been theorized in recent years, but very few have been implemented within real contexts. Moreover, the link blockchain-sustainability was explored, showing that this technology could be the trigger for limiting food waste, reducing exhaust gas emissions, favouring correct urban development, and, in general, improving quality of life.

TI Blockchain-Based Coordination: Assessing the Expressive Power of Smart

AB A common use case for blockchain smart contracts (SC) is that of governing interaction amongst mutually untrusted parties, by automatically enforcing rules for interaction. However, while many contributions in the literature assess SC computational expressiveness, an evaluation of their power in terms of coordination (i.e., governing interaction) is still missing. This is why in this paper we test mainstream SC implementations by evaluating their expressive power in coordinating both inter-users and inter-SC activities. To do so, we exploit the archetypal Linda coordination model as a benchmark-a common practice in the field of coordination models and languages-by discussing to what extent mainstream blockchain technologies support its implementation. As they reveal some notable limitations (affecting, in particular, coordination between SC) we then show how Tenderfone, a custom blockchain implementation providing for a more expressive notion of SC, addresses the aforementioned limitations.

ID MULTIAGENT SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Information systems execute increasingly complex business processes, often across organizations. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential facilitator of (semi)-autonomous cross-organizational business process execution; in particular, so-called consortium blockchains can be considered as promising enablers in this context, as they do not require the use of cryptocurrency-based blockchain technology, as long as the trusted (authenticated) members of the network are willing to provide computing resources for consensus-finding. However, increased autonomy in the execution of business processes also requires the delegation of business decisions to machines. To support complex decision-making processes by assessing potential future outcomes, agent-based simulations can be considered a useful tool for the autonomous enterprise. In this paper, we explore the intersection of multi-agent simulations and consortium blockchain technology in the context of enterprise applications by devising architectures and technology stacks for both off-chain and on-chain agent-based simulation in the context of blockchain-based business process execution.

TI Execution Plan Control in Dynamic Coalition of Robots with Smart
   Contracts and Blockchain
SO INFORMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE dynamic coalition; robot; blockchain; smart contract; execution control
AB The paper presents an approach of the blockchain and smart contracts utilization for dynamic robot coalition creation. The coalition is forming for solving complex tasks in industry applications that requires sequential united actions from the several robots. The main idea is that the process is split into two stages: scheduling and dynamic execution. On the scheduling stage, the coalition is defined based on the correlation of existing tasks and robot equipment, and the execution plan is formed and stored in smart contracts. The second stage is the plan execution. During this stage, smart contract controls how each robot solves its sub-task and whether it solves the sub-task due to the planned moment of time. In case of any deviation from the plan, smart contacts will provide a solution for returning to the plan or for changing the coalition composition with new robots and an execution plan. The prototype for execution control system has been developed based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.

SO ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
LA English
DT Article
DE Cryptocurrency; technical challenges; security; countermeasures
AB Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology. It was developed for the world's first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin in 2008. The reason behind its popularity was its properties which provide pseudonymity, security, and data integrity without third-party intervention. Initially, most of the researches were focused on the Bitcoin system and its limitation, but later other applications of Blockchain e.g. smart contracts and licensing [1] also got famous. Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way how transactions are conducted in daily life. It is not limited to cryptocurrencies but could be possibly applied in various environments where any forms of transactions are done. This article presents a comprehensive overview of Blockchain technology, its development, applications, security issues, and their countermeasures. In particular, the security towards illegal data insertion and the countermeasures is focused. Our analysis of countermeasures of illegal data insertion can be combined for increased efficiency. After the introduction of the Blockchain and consensus algorithm, some famous Blockchain applications and expected future of Blockchain are deliberated. Then, the technical challenges of Blockchain are discussed, in which the main focus here is on the security and the data insertion in Blockchain. The review of the possible countermeasures to overcome the security issues related to data insertion are elaborated.

AB Objectives: Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are increasingly used as an effective method to share patients' records among different hospitals. However, it is still a challenge to access scattered patient data through multiple EHRs. Our goal is to build a system to access patient records easily among EHRs without relying on a centralized supervisory system. Methods: We apply consortium blockchain to compose a distributed system using Hyperledger Fabric incorporating existent EHRs. Peer nodes hold the same ledger on which the address of a patient record in an EHR is written. Individual patients are identified by unique certificates issued by a local certificate authorities that collaborate with each other in a channel of the network. To protect a patient's privacy, we use a proxy re-encryption scheme when the data are transferred. We designed and implemented various chaincodes to handle business logic agreed by member organizations of the network. Results: We developed a prototype system to implement our concept and tested its performance including chaincode logic. The results demonstrated that our system can be used by doctors to find patient's records and verify patient's consent on access to the data. Patients also can seamlessly receive their past records from other hospitals. The access log is stored transparently and immutably in the ledger that is used for auditing purpose. Conclusions: Our system is feasible and flexible with scalability and availability in adapting to existing EHRs for strengthening security and privacy in managing patient records. Our research is expected to provide an effective method to integrate dispersed patient records among medical institutions.

AB Currently, many efforts have been done towards secure data privacy protection and reliable information trace, however the conventional solutions are still vulnerable to information loss, privacy leakage and other attacks till the blockchain technology emerged. Blockchain can record historical data by establishing a collectively maintained and tamper-resistant public ledger to ensure the security and reliability of the data stored in a distributed network. It realizes a decentralized network architecture, which can bring new solutions to many fields such as information tracing and privacy protection. In recent years, blockchain technology has gradually attracted the close attention of all industries, and this paper summarizes the existing blockchain-based systems and applications. We mainly review the applications of blockchain traceability technology in various fields, the blockchain decentralized applications, and other blockchain applications in data security protection, respectively. This work may bring new opportunities and challenges for the development of various industries in the future.

TI GDPR-Compliant Personal Data Management: A Blockchain-Based Solution

AB The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) technology is rapidly evolving, but there is no trusted platform to protect user privacy, protect information between different IoT domains, and promote edge processing. Therefore, we integrate the blockchain technology into constructing trusted IoT platforms. However, the application of blockchain in IoT is hampered by the challenges posed by heavy computing processes. To solve the problem, we put forward a blockchain framework based on mobile edge computing, in which the blockchain mining tasks can be offloaded to nearby nodes or the edge computing service providers and the encrypted hashes of blocks can be cached in the edge computing service providers. Moreover, we model the process of offloading and caching to ensure that both edge nodes and edge computing service providers obtain the maximum profit based on game theory and auction theory. Finally, the proposed mechanism is compared with the centralized mode, mode A (all the miners offload their tasks to the edge computing service providers), and mode B (all the miners offload their tasks to a group of neighbor devices). Simulation results show that under our mechanism, mining networks obtain more profits and consume less time on average.

AB Device to device (D2D) communication is a promising paradigm to support data sharing in the fifth generation (5G) small cell networks. However, D2D communication is more vulnerable to security and privacy threats due to direct wireless connection between the proximity devices. In this paper, we exploit blockchain technology to propose a new distributed and secure data sharing framework named D2D blockchain, where we deploy a set of Access Points (APs) to verify end users' transactions. Besides, in order to enable the end users to receive the required data on time in the D2D blockchain, we propose two new schemes for the transaction confirmation procedure including a relay-assisted transaction relaying scheme and a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) based lightweight block verification scheme. Furthermore, to incentivize the relay devices to help in relaying transactions in congested areas, and to encourage the verifiers to contribute their resources in block verification, we design a two-stage contract theory based joint optimization scheme. To measure the quality of the relayed transaction and the verified block, we formulate two models: value of transaction relaying (VoTR) and value of block verification (VoBV), and then design the optimal contract for each relay device and each verifier. Security analysis and numerical results illustrate that the proposed D2D blockchain and the designed joint optimization scheme are secure and efficient for data sharing among end users.

AB Trust is a critical component of our relationship with others. It forms a basis of not only social relations but also economic ones. Trust is necessarily linked to entrepreneurship because it is useful in conditions of uncertainty. An entrepreneur needs to gain trust of others who cannot obtain full knowledge on what is being introduced to the market as well trust others such as partners, employees and suppliers to deliver on promises. This study aims to examine the role of trust in entrepreneurship. After reviewing the conceptualisation of trust, we argue that trust should be seen in the context of a wider-set of entrepreneurship-supporting values. We then explore different types of trust and their role in entrepreneurship, moving from particular trust to extended trust, ending with a discussion on how new technology is enabling entrepreneurs to create a new form of distributed trust between strangers.

AB This paper proposes an architecture for biometric electronic identification document (e-ID) system based on Blockchain for citizens identity verification in transactions corresponding to the notary, registration, tax declaration and payment, basic health services and registration of economic activities, among others. To validate the user authentication, a biometric e-ID system is used to avoid spoofing and related attacks. Also, to validate the document a digital certificate is used with the corresponding public and private key for each citizen by using a user's PIN. The proposed transaction validation process was implemented on a Blockchain system in order to record and verify the transactions made by all citizens registered in the electoral census, which guarantees security, integrity, scalability, traceability, and no-ambiguity. Additionally, a Blockchain network architecture is presented in a distributed and decentralized way including all the nodes of the network, database and government entities such as national register and notary offices. The results of the application of a new consensus algorithm to our Blockchain network are also presented showing mining time, memory and CPU usage when the number of transactions scales up.

AB Traditional cloud data sharing schemes have relied on the architecture of the network and large storage providers. However, these storage providers work as trusted third parties to transfer and store data. This kind of cloud storage model has some weak points, such as data availability, centralized data storage, high operational cost, and security concern. In this paper, we combine the concept of blockchain with attribute-based signcryption to provide a secure data sharing in the cloud environment. The proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements of the cloud computing such as confidentiality and unforgeability. Further, the smart contract solves the problem of cloud storage such as returning wrong results as in the traditional cloud server. Finally, the performance comparisons and simulation results show that our proposed scheme is more efficient than others, and it is practical.

AB Alternative assets, defined by their low correlation with classical financial assets, have become an important investment vehicle in times of negative interest rates and in the aftermath of the global economic and financial crisis. Hedge funds increasingly invest in physical assets such as fine art, wine, or diamonds. Although digital and not physical, cryptocurrencies share many features of alternative assets, but are hampered by high volatility, sluggish commercial acceptance, and regulatory uncertainties. This special issue covers a broad variety of topics in financial technology, and provides a state-of-the-art overview of cryptocurrencies from economic, financial, statistical and technical points of view.

AB In recent years, unprecedented work has been done in the area of smart cities. The purpose of developing smart cities is to enhance quality of life factors for people dwelling within them. To achieve that purpose, technologies such as IoT and cloud computing have been utilized. Blockchain technology is also among the promising technologies that can offer countless valuable services to its end users. It is a immutable programmable digital register for the purpose of recording virtual assets having some value and was primarily developed for digital currencies like Bitcoin. To fully utilize the services of blockchain technology within smart cities, characteristics of blockchain technology, and its key requirements and research challenges need to be identified. Hence, in this article, an attempt has been made to identify the characteristics of blockchain technology. Furthermore, indispensable requirements for incorporating blockchain technology within smart cities are enumerated. A conceptual architecture for securing smart city using blockchain technology is proposed and explained using a possible use case study. An overview of a real-world three-blockchain- based smart city case study is also presented. Finally, several imperative research challenges are identified and discussed.

AB IoT has the potential to transform the way we think about information and communication technology. IoT has been studied extensively across many disciplines such as the networking, communication, security, business, and management communities. However, many unsolved challenges, especially in managing heterogeneous IoTs, remain to be discussed. Recent studies propose using blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in IoT. This article presents a preliminary study on an architecture that implements blockchain in managing heterogeneous IoT systems. We start by pointing out the limitations of prior IoT systems and the difficulties of integrating IoT and blockchain. Then we outline an architecture to manage a large-scale heterogeneous IoT system. Our main goal is to stimulate further effort and cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing guidance and reference for future studies.

AB In the future 5G paradigm, billions of machinetype devices will be deployed to enable wide-area and ubiquitous data sensing, collection, and transmission. Considering the traffic characteristics of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and the spectrum shortage dilemma, a cost-efficient solution is to share the underutilized spectrum allocated to human-to-human (H2H) users with M2M devices in an opportunistic manner. However, the implementation of large-scale spectrum sharing in 5G heterogeneous networks confronts many challenges, including lack of incentive mechanism, privacy leakage, security threats, and so on. This motivates us to develop a privacy-preserved, incentive-compatible, and spectrum-efficient framework based on blockchain, which is implemented in two stages. First, H2H users sign a contract with the base station for spectrum sharing, and receive dedicated payments based on their contributions. Next, the shared spectrum is allocated to M2M devices to maximize the total throughput. We elaborate the operation details of secure spectrum sharing, incentive mechanism design, and efficient spectrum allocation. A case study is presented to demonstrate the security and efficiency of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline several open issues and conclude this article.

AB Road safety continues to be a great concern despite various advances and initiatives. Sweden introduced the SS approach in 1996 as part of a plan to eliminate road fatalities and injuries. Since then, SS has been internationally adopted by the World Health Organization. In this article, we describe how the SS approach offers a holistic structure of various innovative solutions in the context of IoT and ITS. We also introduce a necessary extension to the SS approach considering emerging technologies such as connected and computing vehicles and vehicle autonomy. To facilitate this extension, we show how blockchains can play a crucial role in ensuring road safety, as well as the safety of its connected elements.

AB It is predicted that more than 20 billion IoT devices will be deployed worldwide by 2020. These devices form the critical infrastructure to support a variety of important applications such as smart city, smart grid, and industrial internet. To guarantee that these applications work properly, it is imperative to authenticate these devices and data generated from them. Although digital signatures can be applied for these purposes, the scale of the overall system and the limited computation capability of IoT devices pose two big challenges. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose DIoTA, a novel decentralized ledger-based authentication framework for IoT devices. DIoTA uses a two-layer decentralized ledger architecture together with a lightweight data authentication mechanism to facilitate IoT devices and data management. We also analyze the performance and security of DIoTA, and explicitly give the major parameters an administrator can choose to achieve a desirable balance between different metrics.

AB The pervasive need to safely share and store information between devices calls for the replacement of centralized trust architectures with decentralized ones. DLTs are seen as the most promising enabler of decentralized trust, but they still lack technological maturity, and their successful adoption depends on the understanding of the fundamental design trade-offs and their reflection in the actual technical design. This work focuses on the challenges and potential solutions for an effective integration of DLTs in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We first introduce the landscape of IoT applications and discuss the limitations and opportunities offered by DLTs. Then we review the technical challenges encountered in the integration of resource-constrained devices with distributed trust networks. We describe the common traits of lightweight synchronization protocols, and propose a novel classification rooted in the IoT perspective. We identify the need for receiving ledger information at the endpoint devices, implying a two-way data exchange that contrasts with the conventional uplink-oriented communication technologies intended for IoT systems.

AB The explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications makes the existing network structure insufficient because it is split by multiple non-cooperative operators, does not scale with the future development of IoT, and calls for novel networking concepts and protocols. The need for multi-operator IoT paradigms poses some unprecedented challenges, including trust considerations. To enable a multi-operator network without shared authentication, we propose a trustworthy grant-free IoT access protocol named Hash Access by leveraging a blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) architecture. B-RAN re-organizes multiple individual radio access networks into a joint multi-operator network based on a blockchain. B-RAN can establish trust among initially trustless operators and efficiently utilize resources across networks, matching and creating values for multiple participants. Furthermore, to mitigate the loss of network efficiency caused by selfish behavior among untrustworthy IoT devices, the proposed protocol can induce IoT devices to follow an access rule and control their data traffic. The proposed framework unifies the IoT access and the underlying B-RAN to reduce confirmation delays in traditional blockchains significantly. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance edge for the B-RAN-enabled Hash Access.

AB Fraud in automobile odometers is a billion dollar problem worldwide. The technical requirements behind any solution for this problem go through the perennial, secure, and immutable registration of vehicular data. Such requirements immediately raise the question of how blockchain technology could be used for this purpose. In this article, the requirements, design choices, and construction details of a blockchain architecture for vehicular odometers are presented and discussed. The architecture advances the state of the art by adopting a more efficient consensus algorithm than the traditional ones, such as proof of work. Results from a prototype proof ofconcept of the proposed architecture validate the solution, which is able to validate a new block in the blockchain every two seconds. Applicability in real scenarios is one step ahead and very promising.

AB Currently, IoT has become an important carrier of blockchains, which not only makes blockchain more ubiquitous but also improves the security of IoT. Consensus is the core component of blockchains with various forms, which raises the following challenges. Dynamic management and configuration of the consensuses in a blockchain are required because IoT applications have high dynamics. Moreover, an IoT node is usually reutilized by various applications in different blockchains, which means the IoT node should be switched frequently to cross consensuses in different blockchains. To address this, a software-defined blockchain architecture is proposed to realized the dynamic configurations for blockchains. Then a consensus function virtualization approach with application-aware work flow is proposed, which can abstract and manage various consensus resources. Next, a transfer-learning-based intelligent scheme is designed to implement the application- layer packet analysis and perform the efficient management of virtualized consensus resources. Experiment results indicate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. This work is significant in enhancing the flexibility and extendibility of blockchains in IoT.

AB The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has brought great challenges of data management, i.e., storing, retrieving and manipulating a large volume of IoT data. Conventional IoT systems rely on centralized architectures to manage IoT data, hence suffering from limited scalability, lack of transparency, and single point of failure issues. As such, we employ blockchain as a distributed ledger to support the decentralized approach of data management in IoT systems, where IoT data are stored in the deployed blockchain for further utilization, e.g., retrieve and audit. A general architecture combining blockchain and IoT systems is presented. Nevertheless, as the resource constraints of IoT devices may still exist during the process of data transmissions from IoT devices to the blockchain network, we propose a case study of a learning-assisted resource allocation method to support intelligent data management. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance compared with baseline solutions.

DE NAT management; smart mobility; security management; blockchain-based

AB Currently, the dual use of IPv4 and IPv6 is becoming a problem. In particular, Network Address Translation (NAT) is an important issue to be solved because of traversal problems in end-to-end applications for lots of mobile IoT devices connected to different private networks. The vertical model is typically used to solve NAT, mobility and security issues for them. However, the existing vertical model has limitations because it handles NAT, mobility and security management one by one. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Integrated Network Function Management (BINFM) scheme where the NAT, mobility, and security management are handled at once. The proposed scheme is advantageous in that by using blockchain and the Query/Reply mechanism, each peer can easily obtain the necessary parameters required to handle the NAT, mobility, and security management in a batch. In addition, this paper explains how our proposed scheme guarantees secure end-to-end data transfers with the use of one time session key. Finally, it is proved that the proposed scheme improves performance on latency from the viewpoints of mobility and security compared to the existing vertical model.

AB Basic safety message (BSM) are messages that contain core elements of a vehicle such as vehicle's size, position, speed, acceleration and others. BSM are lightweight messages that can be regularly broadcast by the vehicles to enable a variety of applications. On the other hand, event-driven message (EDM) are messages generated at the time of occurrence such as accidents or roads sliding and can contain much more heavy elements including pictures, audio or videos. Security, architecture and communication solutions for BSM use cases have been largely documented on in the literature contrary to EDM due to several concerns such as the variant size of EDM, the appropriate architecture along with latency, privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a secure and blockchain based EDM protocol for 5G enabled vehicular edge computing. To offer scalability and latency for the proposed scenario, we adopt a 5G cellular architecture due to its projected features compared to 4G tong-term evaluation (LTE) for vehicular communications. We consider edge computing to provide local processing of EDM that can improve the response time of public agencies (ambulances or rescue teams) that may intervene to the scene. We make use of lightweight multi-receiver signcryption scheme without pairing that offers low time consuming operations, security, privacy and access control. EDM records need to be kept into a distributed system which can guarantee reliability and auditability of EDM. To achieve this, we construct a private blockchain based on the edge nodes to store EDM records. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol confirms its efficiency.

AB The basis of blockchain-related data, stored in distributed ledgers, are digitally signed transactions. Data can be stored on the blockchain ledger only after a digital signing process is performed by a user with a blockchain-based digital identity. However, this process is time-consuming and not user-friendly, which is one of the reasons blockchain technology is not fully accepted. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method, which introduces automated signing of blockchain transactions, while including also a personalized identification of anomalous transactions. In order to evaluate the proposed method, an experiment and analysis were performed on data from the Ethereum public main network. The analysis shows promising results and paves the road for a possible future integration of such a method in dedicated digital signing software for blockchain transactions.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a setup that controls and monitors the physical world around us. The advancement of these systems needs to incorporate an unequivocal spotlight on making these systems efficient. Blockchains and their inherent combination of consensus algorithms, distributed data storage, and secure protocols can be utilized to build robustness and reliability in these systems. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind bitcoins and it provides a decentralized framework to validate transactions and ensure that they cannot be modified. By distributing the role of information validation across the network peers, blockchain eliminates the risks associated with a centralized architecture. It is the most secure validation mechanism that is efficient and enables the provision of financial services, thereby giving users more freedom and power. This upcoming technology provides internet users with the capability to create value and authenticate digital information. It has the capability to revolutionize a diverse set of business applications, ranging from sharing economy to data management and prediction markets. In this paper, we present a holistic survey of various applications of CPS where blockchain has been utilized. Smart grids, health-care systems, and industrial production processes are some of the many applications that can benefit from the blockchain technology and will be discussed in the paper.

AB In the IoT (Internet of Things) environment, smart homes, smart grids, and telematics constantly generate data with complex attributes. These data have low heterogeneity and poor interoperability, which brings difficulties to data management and value mining. The promising combination of blockchain and the Internet of things as BCoT (blockchain of things) can solve these problems. This paper introduces an innovative method DCOMB (dual combination Bloom filter) to firstly convert the computational power of bitcoin mining into the computational power of query. Furthermore, this article uses the DCOMB method to build blockchain-based IoT data query model. DCOMB can implement queries only through mining hash calculation. This model combines the data stream of the IoT with the timestamp of the blockchain, improving the interoperability of data and the versatility of the IoT database system. The experiment results show that the random reading performance of DCOMB query is higher than that of COMB (combination Bloom filter), and the error rate of DCOMB is lower. Meanwhile, both DCOMB and COMB query performance are better than MySQL (My Structured Query Language).

AB We find that firms that change their corporate names to include buzzwords related to cryptocurrencies experience large and permanent valuation gains. We document cumulative abnormal returns of 30 percent in 3 days surrounding such name change announcements. These abnormal returns cannot be explained by industry factors and the small firm effect. The results are robust to outliers and to the choice of the expected returns model used to measure abnormal returns. The abnormal returns generated following cryptocurrency-related name changes are larger and more persistent than those generated following non-cryptocurrency-related name changes.

AB The current relationship between UK and Strasbourg is politically fraught, which presents inevitable challenges for both jurisdictions. This article will analyse how the Strasbourg Court has responded to these challenges when dealing with applications against the UK, particularly when an application is brought following determination by the UK Supreme Court. It will be argued that there is some evidence that the Strasbourg Court has recently been using the admissibility stage as a novel site for effecting strategic behaviour, in order to moderate and influence UK-Strasbourg relations. The effect of this recent inclination, and some possible justifications for it, will then be set out.

AB When bitcoin was released by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, few could have predicted that it would attract as much attention as it has today. It has spawned a veritable host of other cryptocurrencies, including ether on the upstart Ethereum network, which boasts smart contract functionality. The underlying blockchain technology has also attracted attention, with some within the blockchain community suggesting that it can solve such diverse problems as secured digital voting to tracking food provenance. In the legal context, blockchains have been envisaged as capable of revolutionising registries for assets ranging from land to intellectual property, modernising clearing and settlement, and even fundamentally transforming the contracting process. This article critically evaluates the popular claims surrounding the potential of blockchain technologies to disrupt the legal system by separating hype from fact.

AB Certificates are important to document educational attainments, and educational documentation is required when it comes to job-seeking and career advancement. It is therefore vital that these records are stored in longterm available and tamper-proof ledgers. The Blockchain for Education platform is a secure and intuitive solution for issuing, sharing, and validating of certificates.

AB Although cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can be considered new advances, they have started to be recognized widely, and this has been discussed and investigated in lots of research studies. In parallel, the primary purpose of this study is to investigate the development and evolution of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology over the past years in the academic world. To this end, 334 scholarly journal articles are examined to: (1) conduct a comprehensive literature review in the field of cryptocurrencies and blockchain; (2) identify the possible trends and changes in this field over the ten years; (3) compare the publishing productivity of journals; and (4) guide future research in this field. The results highlight that the researchers mainly concentrate on legal and ethical issues of them; their benefits, challenges, and risks; their conceptualization, evolution, and future; the economic dimension of them; and financial and accounting related issues of them.

TI Immutable autobiography of smart cars leveraging blockchain technology
SO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
LA English
DT Review
AB The popularity of smart cars is increasing around the world as they offer a wide range of services and conveniences. These smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors generating a large amount of data, many of which are critical. Besides, there are multiple parties involved in the lifespan of a smart car, such as manufacturers, car owners, government agencies, and third-party service providers who also generate data about the vehicle. In addition to managing and sharing data among these entities in a secure and privacy-friendly way which is a great challenge itself, there exists a trust deficit about some types of data as they remain under the custody of the car owner (e.g. satellite navigation and mileage data) and can easily be manipulated. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted architecture enabling the owner of a smart car to create an immutable record of every data, called the autobiography of a car, generated within its lifespan. We also explain how the trust about this record is guaranteed by the immutability characteristic of the blockchain. Furthermore, the article describes how the proposed architecture enables a secure and privacy-preserving mechanism for sharing of smart car data among different parties.

TI Blockchain's future: can the decentralized blockchain community succeed
   in creating standards?
SO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
LA English
DT Review
AB Nakamoto proposed a new solution to transact value via the internet. And since 2009, blockchain technology has expanded and diversified. It has, however, proven to be inefficient in the way it achieves its outcomes, especially through the proof of work protocol. Other developers are promoting alternative methods but, as yet, none has superseded proof of work. The competing protocols illuminate a key feature of the blockchain community, namely, its inability to create consensus in a decentralized community. Because of this lack of consensus, the formation of standards is particularly difficult to achieve. At best standards are contested sites, and we examine three such sites where some form of agreement over standards will be essential if blockchain is to evolve successfully. These three sites are blockchain governance, smart contracts, and interoperability of blockchains. We argue that because standards' formation is a contested and contingent process, the blockchain community will persist in creating difficulties and barriers for itself until it is able to resolve internal conflicts.

TI ReCon: Sybil-resistant consensus from reputation
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; Consensus; Sybil; Reputation
AB In this paper we describe how to couple reputation systems with distributed consensus protocols to provide a scalable permissionless consensus protocol with a low barrier of entry, while still providing strong resistance against Sybil attacks for large peer-to-peer networks of untrusted validators.
   We introduce reputation module ReCon, which can be laid on top of various consensus protocols such as PBFT or HoneyBadger. The protocol takes external reputation ranking as input and then ranks nodes based on the outcomes of consensus rounds run by a small committee, and adaptively selects the committee based on the current reputation. ReCon can tolerate larger threshold of malicious nodes (up to slightly above 1/2) compared to the 1/3 limit of BFT consensus algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A novel data exploitation framework based on blockchain
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of connected objects is growing at a rapid pace. These smart devices continuously generate enormous amounts of data, which can be valuable for many services. One key point hindering the growth of such services is that they often deal with personal and sensitive data. That usually leads users to be more conservative about the usage of their data by third parties. In this context, a seamless need has emerged in order to build an Intelligent Data Exploitation System (IDES) whereby service providers exploit users' data in a secure and more transparent manner. To achieve this goal, we propose in this paper a novel framework based on blockchain in order to promote personal data. The proposed solution is user centric in the sense that the user has the complete control on his data's exploitation life-cycle. Besides, services providers will not have a copy on the data itself. Instead, a separate secure environment is proposed in order to execute a model on top of data. To assess the performance of this work, a real world application has been developed. Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 is used as a blockchain technology and a combination between Graphene-SGX and Cryptobox is used as a secure execution environment. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed solution is secure and efficient enough to be integrated within a real world application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On the robustness of Lightning Network in Bitcoin
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Lightning Network; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Network robustness
AB An off-chain transaction protocol called Lightning Network was recently introduced to enable low-fee and micropayment transactions on the top of the Bitcoin network. This technology has the potential to solve the inherent scalability issue of the Bitcoin system, but is still questionable whether the proposed system is highly secure and robust against various cyberattacks.
   In this paper, we analyzed the network characteristics of the Lightning Network mainnet which was launched on March 15, 2018 and found that the Lightning Network topology shows strong scale-free network characteristics. This implies that Lightning Network can be vulnerable to DDoS attacks targeting some specific nodes in the network because there are a few highly connected "hub'' nodes in a scale-free network. We experimentally analyze the robustness of Lightning Network via the simulation of network attack model. Our simulation results demonstrate that the connectivity of the existing Lightning Network cannot be maintained sufficiently against target attacks that repeatedly destroy a few nodes with high centrality.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that uses distributed ledgers for transparent, reliable, and traceable information exchange among network nodes. Blockchain and its 3rd generation Tangle-based implementations quickly extend their territory beyond crypto-currency to a broad range of applications using fee-less transactions over the Internet of things (IoT). However, this technology suffers from sluggishness in consensus-based validation of information that restricts its applicability to time-sensitive applications such as smart health. In this letter, we propose an optimized policy for sampling rate by IoT sensors that utilize blockchain and Tangle technologies for their transmission with the goal of minimizing the age of information (AoI) experienced by the end-users, considering both processing and networking resource constraints. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the current fixed-rate update policy. Further, a closed-form solution is obtained for the optimal sampling rate in a network of homogeneous IoT nodes as a benchmark system.

TI SPIR: A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Incentive Scheme for Reliable

   privacy; real-time map updates
AB The high-precision maps can provide additional information on roads and conditions, which plays an important role in autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigation. Compared with the existing map update methods, the real-time map updates based on crowdsensing have lower cost and higher accuracy. However, in the process of map update, the map service platform (MSP) cannot recruit enough vehicle users to obtain the sensing data due to a lack of incentive mechanism. Therefore, how to motivate more vehicle users to provide high-quality sensing data is the key for real-time map updates. In this article, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving incentive scheme for reliable real-time map updates, named SPIR. Specifically, under the condition of limited service platform budget and limited vehicle user's ability, an effective incentive mechanism based on reverse auction is presented, which can solve two core problems: i.e., payment control for MSP and completion quality for vehicle users. Meanwhile, a credit management and payment system based on the blockchain technique are designed. In addition, the partially blind signature technique is applied to guarantee the security of the incentive mechanism and protect the privacy of vehicle users. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed SPIR achieves near-optimal benefits, which can provide the fair reward for vehicle users and reasonable budget for the MSP. In the real-time map update services, SPIR can guarantee the computational efficiency and data reliability.

However, there exist significant security and privacy challenges due to the untrusted broadcast features and wireless transmission of the UAV networks. This article endeavors to resolve the security issues through proposing a novel privacy-preserving secure spectrum trading and sharing scheme based on blockchain technology. Specifically, from the operator's perspective, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is first introduced, in which a primary mobile network operator (MNO) leases its owned spectrum to a secondary UAV network in exchange for some revenue from the UAV operators. To address the potential security issues, a spectrum blockchain framework is then proposed to illustrate detailed operations of how the blockchain helps to improve the spectrum trading environment. Under this framework, a Stackelberg game is formulated to jointly maximize the profits of the MNO and the UAV operators considering uniform and nonuniform pricing schemes. Security assessment and numerical results confirm the security and efficiency of our schemes for spectrum sharing in UAV-assisted cellular networks.

TI Machine Learning Adoption in Blockchain-Based Smart Applications: The

AB In recent years, the emergence of blockchain technology (BT) has become a unique, most disruptive, and trending technology. The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) industry is growing very fast to transform factories, homes, farms and practically everything else to make them efficient and intelligent. IoT is applied in different resilient scenarios and applications. IoT faces lots of challenges due to lack of computational power, battery and storage resources. Fortunately, the rise of blockchain technology facilitates IoT in many security solutions. Using blockchain, communication between IoT and emerging computing technologies is made efficient. In this work, we propose a secure service provisioning scheme with a fair payment system for Lightweight Clients (LCs) based on blockchain. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism based on reputation is proposed. We use consortium blockchain with the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Furthermore, we use Smart Contracts (SCs) to validate the services provided by the Service Providers (SPs) to the LCs, transfer cryptocurrency to the SPs and maintain the reputation of the SPs. Moreover, the Keccak256 hashing algorithm is used for converting the data of arbitrary size to the hash of fixed size. AES128 encryption technique is used to encrypt service codes before sending to the LCs. The simulation results show that the LCs receive validated services from the SPs at an affordable cost. The results also depict that the participation rate of SPs is increased because of the incentive mechanism.

AB Blockchain technology has been increasingly used for decentralizing cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) architectures to address limitations faced by centralized systems. While many existing efforts are successful in decentralization with multiple servers (i.e., full nodes) to handle faulty nodes, an important issue has arisen that external clients have to rely on a relay node to communicate with the full nodes in the blockchain. Compromization of such relay nodes may result in a security breach and even a blockage of IoT sensors from the network. In this article, we propose blockchain-based decentralized IoT management systems for censorship resistance, which include a "diffusion" function to deliver all messages from sensors to all full nodes and an augmented consensus protocol to check data losses, replicate processing outcome, and facilitate opportunistic outcome delivery. We also leverage public key aggregation to reduce communication complexity and signature verification. The experimental results from proof-of-concept implementation and deployment in a real distributed environment show the feasibility and effectiveness in achieving censorship resistance.

AB This article develops and defines Blockchain technology in its classic format. New suggested proposed algorithms are then analyzed in order to introduce new and modified versions of Blockchain technology. After that, fundamental infrastructure is presented in order to represent its application in new generation of telecommunications. In addition, this article interrogates these algorithms and their efficiency to make secure connections that transfer data packets in any format (boxes or packets of information) in a secure and encrypted method at which sender and receiver of information remain anonymous. Then, this research describes applications of the novel approach in new format of making live stream technology in real world communications. Moreover, according to this new approach, new concepts can be predicted in the new generation of social media based on live communications. Meanwhile, the compatibility is justified for consistency, reliability and flexibility of this new proposed technology with other existing and defined format of technology in today's world. At last, conclusions of this new emerging technology and its superiority compared to other designed technologies in the field of live streaming and telecommunications are discussed.

AB Supply chain management or logistics is a crucial aspect of any business, be it agriculture, food, healthcare, and more. However, it also involves a communication among a host of actors performing different roles in the chain. Integration of these actors in a transparent yet secure way is needed, which blockchain technology has the potential to do so. In this article, different models of blockchain application in logistics are discussed and how the permissioned blockchains can be used in realizing the business case. An overview of different frameworks which enable permissioned blockchains are discussed in this article. Based on this, the authors propose an asset transfer model which can be employed to enhance supply chain trackability using permissioned blockchain.

AB Blockchain, as an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has attracted intensive attention in both research and applications recently. Blockchain, especially powered by chain-coded smart contracts, has the full potential of revolutionizing increasingly centralized cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) for constructions and applications, and reshaping traditional knowledge automation workflows. The key advantage of blockchain technology lies in the fact that it can enable the establishment of secured, trusted, and decentralized autonomous ecosystems for various scenarios, especially for better usage of the legacy devices, infrastructure, and resources.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a financial transaction network implemented using blockchain technology. Users in the Bitcoin network use pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses and conduct transactions with others without revealing their real identities. In order to further enhance their privacy and convenience, users often use a large number of different addresses. In this paper, we analyze different patterns of transactions occurring in the Bitcoin network in order to cluster addresses that share the same ownership. In order to evaluate the proposed clustering approach, Bitcoin addresses belonging to known entities are tagged and these are used in conjunction with the Gini impurity index to test the accuracy of the recovered identity-based clusters. The results show that our heuristic was able to detect relationships between Bitcoin addresses that were missed by the existing heuristics.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a decentralized semi-anonymous peer-to-peer payment system in which the transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public massively replicated ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoin is currently considered as one of the most disruptive technologies. Bitcoin represents a paradox of opposing forces. On one hand, it is fundamentally social, allowing people to transact in a peer-to-peer manner to create and exchange value. On the other hand, Bitcoin's core design philosophy and user base contain strong anti-social elements and constraints, emphasizing anonymity, privacy, and subversion of traditional centralized financial systems. We believe that the success of Bitcoin, and the financial ecosystem built around it, will likely rely on achieving an optimal balance between these social and anti-social forces. To elucidate the role of these forces, we analyze the evolution of the entire Bitcoin transaction graph from its inception, and quantify the evolution of its key structural properties. We observe that despite its different nature, the Bitcoin transaction graph exhibits many universal dynamics typical of social networks. However, we also find that Bitcoin deviates in important ways due to anonymity-seeking behavioral patterns of its users. As a result, the network exhibits a two-orders-of-magnitude larger diameter, sparse tree-like communities, and an overwhelming majority of transitional or intermediate accounts with incoming and outgoing edges but zero cumulative balances. These results illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the most popular cryptocurrency, and provide us with initial understanding of social networks rooted in and driven by anti-social constraints.

AB Blockchain, as a secured, trusted, and decentralized architecture, is used to create secure and tamper-proof payment schemes, which can serve economies and societies without trusted parties. However, the transparency and traceability of blockchain severely restrict the anonymity of participants in the real world, which will cause participants' privacy leakage. Toward this end, in this paper, an anonymous off-blockchain micropayments scheme (AOM) is proposed for cryptocurrencies in the real world. In AOM, a payee receives micropayments from an "honest-but-curious" intermediary ${\mathcal {T}}$ by solving puzzles which are generated based on the standard RSA assumption. Meanwhile, ${\mathcal {T}}$ also receives micropayments from the payers by payee's solutions and ${\mathcal {T}}$ will randomly select the inputs of the merging transaction ${T}_{\text {mer}}$ . In order to improve service efficiency of ${\mathcal {T}}$ and resist denial of service attack, one of the outputs of ${T}_{\text {mer}}$ is paid for ${\mathcal {T}}$ as a service fee. Besides, AOM simultaneously ensures the correctness and fairness of transactions. Finally, from the analyses of property and security, AOM has strong unlinkability, ability for anti-attacks and unforgeability.

AB Smart grid has emerged as a successful application of cyber-physical systems in the energy sector. Among numerous key technologies of the smart grid, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) provides a promising solution to reduce the level of demand-supply mismatch by leveraging the bidirectional energy-trading capabilities of electric vehicles. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain, contract theory, and edge computing. First, we develop a consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for V2G. Then, we consider the information asymmetry scenario, and propose an efficient incentive mechanism based on contract theory. The social welfare optimization problem falls into the category of difference of convex programming and is solved by using the iterative convex-concave procedure algorithm. Next, edge computing has been incorporated to improve the successful probability of block creation. The computational resource allocation problem is modeled as a two-stage: 1) Stackelberg leader-follower game and 2) the optimal strategies are obtained by using the backward induction approach. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is validated via numerical results and theoretical analysis.

AB Blockchain technique, with the novelties of decentralization, smart contract, security and cooperative autonomy, is expected to play great effects on promoting the development of energy local networks (ELNs). This paper presents an automated demand response (ADR) framework for decentralized scheduling and secure peer-to-peer (P2P) trading among energy storage systems in ELNs. Different from most existing works that trade electricity over long distances and through complex meshes, this proposed work performs decentralized and automated demand response through energy sharing of P2P executors. We explore for the first time the benefits of a promising blockchain to conduct the overall ADR framework and increase the P2P trading security. To achieve decentralized scheduling without relying on a central entity, a price-incentive noncooperative game theoretic model is introduced to produce equilibrium solutions for energy storage systems. Moreover, we develop a schedulable ability evaluation system to match trading pairs involving buying and selling nodes. On this basis, a state-machine-driven smart contract mechanism is built to realize P2P trading without reliance on a trusted third party. To illustrate the implementation details of the ADR method, a distributed algorithm is designed. Case studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Blockchain is an open distributed ledger technology that enables ledger-maintainers on a network to collaboratively synchronize and update their own distributed copies of a single global ledger, with the goal of keeping the ledger copies consistent. This paper presents a theoretical control-model formulation of the founding Satoshi Nakamoto blockchain, aimed at enhancing our operational understanding and development of blockchain systems. The control model is generic of every honest ledger-maintainer's local operations on a blockchain network. The presented research is a logical systematization of operational knowledge that is understandable and explainable for blockchain system engineering and research. Using a software tool supporting a supervisory control theory applied in the formulation, the control model is synthesized and logically validated.

AB Consensus is one of the key problems in blockchains. There are many articles analyzing the performance of threat models for blockchains. But the network stability seems lack of attention, which in fact affects the blockchain performance. This paper studies the performance of a well adopted consensus algorithm, Raft, in networks with non-negligible packet loss rate. In particular, we propose a simple but accurate analytical model to analyze the distributed network split probability. At a given time, we explicitly present the network split probability as a function of the network size, the packet loss rate, and the election timeout period. To validate our analysis, we implement a Raft simulator and the simulation results coincide with the analytical results. With the proposed model, one can predict the network split time and probability in theory and optimize the parameters in Raft consensus algorithm.

AB The growth of individualized product demands drives high flexibility of manufacturing processes, which requires large-scale deployment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Since centralized control of IIoT suffers from poor flexibility in coping with disturbances and changes, a decentralized organization structure is a better choice, in which a permissioned blockchain-driven IIoT can enable partially decentralized self-organization and thus offload and accelerate the optimization of upper-level manufacturing planning. A novel iterative bi-level hybrid intelligence model named ManuChain is proposed to get rid of unbalance/inconsistency between holistic planning and local execution in individualized manufacturing systems. Lower-level blockchain-driven smart contracts proactively decentralize fine-grained and individualized task execution among machine tools via Raspberry Pi-based smart gateways and make the results available on an upper-level digital twin model for iterative coarse-grained holistic optimization. A prototype ManuChain based on a permissioned blockchain network is presented to realize both lower-level crowd self-organizing intelligence and upper-level holistic optimization intelligence.

TI Using Blockchain for Improved Video Integrity Verification

DT Article

ID DOUBLE COMPRESSION
AB A video record plays a crucial role in providing evidence for crime scenes or road accidents. However, the main problem with the video record is that it is often vulnerable to various video tampering attacks. Although visual evidence is required to conduct an integrity verification before investigations, it is still difficult for human vision to detect a forgery. In this paper, we propose a novel video integrity verification method (IVM) that takes advantage of a blockchain framework. The proposed method employs an effective blockchain model in centralized video data, by combining a hash-based message authentication code and elliptic curve cryptography to verify the integrity of a video. In our method, video content with a predetermined size (segments) is key-hashed in a real-time manner and stored in a chronologically chained fashion, thus establishing an irrefutable database. The verification process applies the same procedure to the video segment and generates a hash value that can be compared with the hash in the blockchain. The proposed IVM is implemented on a PC environment, as well as on an accident data recorder-embedded system for verification. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better detection capabilities and robustness toward various kinds of tampering, such as copy-move, insert, and delete, as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. An analysis based on execution time along with an increase in the number of blocks within the blockchain shows a minimal overhead in the proposed method.

AB Nowadays, more companies are trying to implement blockchain technology (BT) that enables to increase the quality of the products/services to their supply chains in order to improve their performance. BT can be applied to different sectors according to their specific needs. Evaluation of BT with respect to sectors needs considering several factors and it can be considered as a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, the appropriateness of BT in Supply Chain Management (SCM) according to different sectors has been evaluated by using a MCDM methodology based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs). The suggested MCDM methodology consists of Delphi method, hesitant fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (HF-AHP) and Hesitant Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HF-TOPSIS) methods. In the first stage, the criteria and sub-criteria utilized for performance evaluation of BT in supply chain management have been determined by using Delphi method. The weights of main and sub-criteria have been obtained through HF-AHP method and finally, the alternative sectors have been ranked according to results of HF-TOPSIS method. For this aim, a hierarchical MCDM problem that consists of 5 main and 17 sub-criteria has been created and the alternative sectors have been evaluated. As a result, medicine/drug and jewelry sectors have been respectively determined as the most and the least suitable alternatives in order to implement BT by means of the proposed HFSs based methodology. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to show the importance of the main criteria weights on ranking of alternatives.

AB Centuries ago in western Micronesia, Yapese islanders sailed to the Palauan archipelago 250 miles away to carve their famous stone money disks (rai) from limestone and then transported them back for use as exchange valuables in various social transactions. While rai were not strictly currency, their value is similar to other traditional and modern objects where worth is arbitrarily based on both real and perceived attributes. Recently, corollaries have been made between rai and newly established electronic cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology-essentially, digital ledgers that track financial transactions in real time across a computer network to ensure that they are seamless and incorruptible. In this study, we examine the sociophysical similarities and differences between stone money and cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain, both of which demand a unified and continuous chain of information to ensure that the value is known and ownership indisputable. This research suggests that stone money: (a) is an exemplary ancient analog to blockchain that used oral ledgers solidified through social networks to create accurate and unbroken lines of communication so that economic relationships involving rai could be established, maintained, exchanged, and rectified, and (b) may have been a progenitor that inspired the development of Bitcoin.

AB Locally repairable codes with more than one recovering set are demanded in the application to distributed storage. For each failure node (or disk), it is desired to have as many recovering sets as possible. In this paper, we make use of automorphisms of rational function fields to construct locally repairable codes with multiple recovering sets. Although we focus on two recovering sets, our construction can be easily generalized to the case of multiple recovering sets. In particular, we obtain a class of locally repairable codes with minimum distance only 1 less than the upper bound.

AB The core security of proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain networks, relies on PoW consensus algorithm and requires miners solving a crypto-puzzles of hash computation. However, the mining process in the blockchain is resource-intensive where only the first miner who completes full PoW will be rewarded. Therefore, miners exhibit malicious behaviors which cause a waste of distributed computation resource, even posing a threat on the efficiency of blockchain networks. In this brief, we propose a new reputation-based mechanism for the PoW computation in the blockchain, in which miners are incentivized to conduct honest mining. Based on the game theory, we design a reputation-based algorithm to encourage honest mining of miners, and thereby increase the overall revenue of the pool. In addition, numerical illustrations are also presented to support the performance of our proposed mechanism.

AB Let us consider a situation where someone wants to encrypt his/her will on an existing blockchain, e.g. Bitcoin, and allow an encrypted will to be decryptable only if designated members work together. At a first glance, such a property seems to be easily provided by using conventional threshold encryption. However, this idea cannot be straight-forwardly implemented since key pairs for an encryption mechanism is additionally required. In this paper, we propose a new threshold encryption scheme in which key pairs for ECDSA that are already used in the Bitcoin protocol can be directly used as they are. Namely, a unique key pair can be simultaneously used for both ECDSA and our threshold encryption scheme without losing security. Furthermore, we implemented our scheme on the Bitcoin regtest network, and show that it is fairly practical. For example, the execution time of the encryption algorithm Enc (resp., the threshold decryption algorithm Dec) is 0.2 sec. (resp., 0.3 sec.), and the total time is just only 3 sec. including all the cryptographic processes and network communications for a typical parameter setting. Also, we discuss several applications of our threshold encryption scheme in detail: Claiming priority of intellectual property, sealed-bid auction, lottery, and coin tossing service.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) has made ubiquitous computing a reality by extending Internet connectivity in various applications deployed across the globe. IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison to its merits over the others.

AB Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change "cryptodamages" roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.

AB Blockchain technology has proven to be revolutionary in its utilities without, however, becoming popular either in Brazil or in the world. Through a systematic review of the literature, we sought to address the issue, as well as to analyze the current stage of existing research. The objective of this theoretical essay is to contribute to the development of lines of research that aim to increase knowledge about the current stage of the phenomenon. This study provides a qualitative analysis of what is the state of the art on the subject that complements both qualitative and quantitative methods of traditional literature review. The essay concludes that it is necessary that solutions to the questions presented here be elaborated so that this technology can be widely disseminated, as well as so society can enjoy all that it has to offer

TI SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MATURITY: AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING LITERATURE REVIEW
   ON MODELS, DIMENSIONS AND APPROACHES
SO LOGFORUM
LA English
DT Review
DE organizational maturity; supply chain management (SCM); SCM maturity;
   maturity model; literature review
AB Background: In recent years, organizational maturity has disseminated its concepts to various management domains, for instance, Supply Chain Management (SCM). The present paper is an attempt to review the developments in the realm of SCM over the past two decades. In the domain of SCM maturity, different models, dimensions (areas) and approaches are advanced for maturity measurements.
   Methods: Research studies conducted and presented in the literature, including papers on conference proceedings, articles in journals and technical reports, are reviewed; the review covers a time span from the early 1990s to the present time (2019). Also provided in this review are the previous models, dimensions (areas/ elements), and approaches for measuring SCM maturity techniques. Additionally, research gaps are identified, analysed and discussed.
   Results: After reviewing, the research studies in the field and the dimensions found in the works are placed into different categories. The current study aims to present a review of the literature, ultimately providing help to researchers in realizing gaps and opportunities in the field of SCM maturity. There are also different approaches to supply chain maturity models. For example, one approach may solely focus on integration while another might concentrate on SC visibility and traceability. In more recent research studies, more attention is paid to such specific areas of supply chain as flexibility and sustainability. The results of the present paper point to gaps, which indicate that more research works are required. In addition, it is assumed that the materials presented here may help establish more comprehensive SCM maturity models.
   Conclusions: It is seen that supply chain management is rapidly shifting toward e-SCM, and some other technologies like blockchain. Also, supply chain sustainability comes to the fore as a significant approach. It should be reminded that other strategic features of supply chains like leanness, agility, resilience, sustainability, integration, green and reverse logistics etc., also play their own role in the field. Combining these strategic features can be an effective idea for developing more comprehensive models for SCM maturity. To sum up, the results of the present survey indicate that the published works need more adequacy and treatment research, and that more research is called for to bridge the gaps in the realm of SCM maturity.

AB The lack of industrialization, inadequacy of the management, information inaccuracy, and inefficient supply chains are the significant issues in an agri-food supply chain. The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study.

AB Blockchain, the underlying technology for Bitcoin, is a distributed digital ledger technology that enables record verification by many independent parties rather than a centralized authority, therefore making it more difficult to tamper with the data. This emerging technology has the potential to enhance various authentication and verification processes in image sharing and data security. It has the potential to promote patient-centered healthcare by giving greater control to patients over their own data. Blockchain can also be utilized for administrative tasks, such as credentialing, claims adjudication, and billing management. It can also be utilized to enhance software supporting research and clinical trials. Blockchain complements artificial intelligence (AI) and these can work synergistically to create better solutions. Although many challenges exist for increased adoption of blockchain within radiology and healthcare in general, it can play a major role in our practice and consequently, it is important for medical imaging professionals to become familiar with the technology.

AB The notion of confidential transactions plays a central role in ensuring the confidentiality of transaction amounts in a block-chain-based cryptocurrency. Past researches have confirmed that the access policy of transaction amounts influences the anonymity of a cryptocurrency. Most of the current techniques of confidential transactions are based on the discrete logarithm problem. Because of the threats from quantum algorithms, clients are eager to enjoy security guarantees in a post-quantum scenario. Lattices are an ideal source of hardness, due to its exclusive worst-case to the average-case phenomenon. Nevertheless, the distinctions between the discrete logarithm problem and lattice problems build an obstacle in the way of borrowing the ideas from the former to the latter directly. In this study, inspired by the notion of commitments to polynomials and zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge for the inhomogeneous short integer solution problem, the authors give an approach to implement confidential transactions using lattice techniques.

AB The information-centric networking (ICN) has been proposed to meet the increasing demand for efficient content delivery. However, the in-network caching mechanism of ICN makes it hard to provide data security and privacy for content providers (CPs). Although many access control schemes are proposed to improve the security of ICN, there are still some problems unsolved. On the one hand, in spite of the centralized access control schemes are proposed to improve the security of data sharing, the single point of failure issue is inevitable. On the other hand, the decentralized access control schemes allow the content provider to control the key distribution for encrypted content, but it is inefficient when they are applied in hierarchical access, and the audit of content access is ignored. In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-based access control framework which is called as SBAC, to provide a content provider with the ability of sharing, audit and revocation on his content in a secure way. Specifically, we design a matching-based access control model to achieve hierarchical access, and present a blockchain-based access token mechanism to resist the single point of failure and balance privacy and audit. And Cuckoo filter is introduced to achieve efficient query of access token in verification. Furthermore, our SBAC keeps the characteristic of pervasive caching of ICN. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that SBAC is suitable in practice.

AB In recent years, the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) is providing a promising opportunity not only for the development of various home automation systems but also for different industrial applications. By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.

AB In the last decade, blockchain has emerged as one of the most influential innovations in software architecture and technology. Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Side chains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.

AB Recent advances in science mapping allowed to analyze the entire intellectual structure of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in business-related disciplines to identify 174 academic articles as well as 1482 practitioner-oriented articles published since the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2008 to highlight key trends of the published outputs. The results demonstrate academic research done by 389 authors in 296 organizations based in 50 countries that only just initiated the conversation on four major streams of the literature-Bitcoin and ayptocurrencies; blockchain adoption; cryptocurrency and blockchain environment; and business model innovations. When comparing academic scholarship to practitioner-oriented literature, the results demonstrate that practitioners discussed investor-related themes, cryptocurrency intrinsic value, political-economic sphere, and the impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies on the wider society in greater detail. As a result, a number of themes are identified and discussed that could align academic and practitioner interests and provide guidance for further research in this important field.

AB This paper uses a unique dataset of 120 regulatory events from five classes to test the relevance of the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency value. Time-series market-wide estimates and panel estimates for 300 individual coins and tokens show statistically and economically significant impact of anti-money laundering and issuance regulation. Tighter regulation and more active role of government decrease cryptocurrency prices, evidencing that potentially lower risks and wider adoption commonly attributed to the establishment of the regulatory framework do not compensate for respective efficiency and consumer utility losses. The market is generally efficient in reflecting regulatory information in cryptocurrency prices.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for cardiovascular medicine but is limited by a lack of large, heterogeneous and granular data sets. Blockchain provides secure interoperability between siloed stakeholders and centralized data sources. We discuss integration of blockchain with AI for data-centric analysis and information flow, its current limitations and potential cardiovascular applications.

AB Under pressures to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is an ongoing transition of energy decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.

AB Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be highly efficient in various applications like hidden area exploration, delivery, or surveillance and can enhance the quality of experience (QoE) for end-users. However, the number of drone-based applications are not very high due to the constrained flight time. The weights of the drones need to be kept less, and intuitively they cannot be loaded with big batteries. Frequent recharging and battery replacement processes limit the appropriate use of drones in most applications. A peer-to-peer distributed network of drones and charging stations is a highly promising solution to empower drones to be used in multiple applications by increasing their flight time. The charging stations are limited, and therefore, an adequate, fair, and cost-optimal scheduling algorithm is required to serve the most needed drone first. The proposed model allows the drones to enter into the network and request for a charging time slot from the station. The stations are also the part of the same network, this work proposes a scheduling algorithm for drones who compete for charging slots with constraints of optimizing criticality and task deadline. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the energy trading between the drones and charging station in a cost-optimal manner. Numerical results based on simulations show that the proposed model provides a better price for the drones to get charged and better revenue for the charging stations simultaneously.

AB The sharing of government information resources is significant for improving the level of governance and social information. However, due to the existence of cross-domain security and trust islands, government departments are hindering the sharing of government information resources with other organizations and the public. To this end, the blockchain technology is used to construct a decentralized distributed peer-to-peer trust service system, which is integrated with the existing PKI/CA security system to establish a new trust model that supports multi-CA coexistence. Based on this, the structural composition and functional data flow of the blockchain smart city information resource sharing and exchange model designed in this paper. This paper launched a study on the role of the smart big data platform, and selected the development of smart cities in Hefei as an empirical analysis. From the connotation of smart city, block chain and big data technology combined, and the positive effects of relevant information technology summarized on the construction of smart city big data platform. Based on this, the smart city development level evaluation model of TOPSIS method constructed. The evaluation model constructed to make a vertical comparison from 2012 to 2017, the scale of smart cities is growing at an average annual rate of more than 30%, saving 20% of urban resource allocation and becoming a new pillar industry. Therefore, Hefei City should further increase environmental supervision and promote the use of low-carbon environmental protection new energy. The improvement of government management level has a positive effect on the construction of smart Hefei.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to all kinds of equipment in industrial production, whether it is machine equipment in factories or engine in automobiles and airplanes, on which sensors are installed and connected to wireless network terminals to collect and share data. At present, because IIoT system is an open, distributed and heterogeneous system, it is a great challenge to implement trusted communication in IIoT. Blockchain technology has become a new way to solve the cooperative trust issues of industrial Internet of Things. Using blockchain, a tamper-proof system can be built, which can be used as an audit tool for hardware products of industrial Internet of Things from chip to whole equipment. Blockchain improve productivity and operational efficiency of IIoT through smart contract, allowing machines to manage themselves. To apply blockchain technology in IIoT, one of the main issues is to solve the security and efficiency problems of consensus protocols. In this paper, a reputation scheme is proposed to encourage normal nodes and abnormal nodes both to participate in network collaboration in a good way. In order to guide the behavior, a credit based incentive approach is proposed. The reward and punishment factor is designed in the revenue payment function of reputation. The effectiveness is that the cooperative behavior is rewarded, and the non cooperative behavior is punished. The main advantage of our scheme is that our reputation based incentive module can be implemented on state-of-the-art PoX protocols, which is called PoRX,and can make PoX protocols achieve better consensus states. Therefore, it would benefit the applications of IIoT with blockchain. A prototype has been implemented and the experimental results shows that our scheme can effectively encourage the cooperative behavior of the nodes in IIoT, that can benefit the network.

ID MEDICAL DATA; PREDICTION
AB Large volumes of mobility data is collected in various application domains. Enterprise applications are designed on the notion of centralised data control where the proprietary of the data rests with the enterprise and not with the user. This has consequences as evident by the occasional privacy breaches. Trajectory mining is an important data mining problem, however, trajectory data can disclose sensitive location information about users. In this work, we propose a decentralised blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving trajectory data mining framework where the proprietary of the data rests with the user and not with the enterprise. We formalise the privacy preservation in trajectory data mining settings, present a proposal for privacy preservation, and implement the solution as a proof-of-concept. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is conducted to assess the applicability of the system. The results show that the proposed system yields promising results for blockchain-enabled privacy preservation in user trajectory data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SECURITY
AB Bitcoin security draws more and more attention recently. One of Bitcoin vulnerabilities is caused by ECDSA weak randomness. A random number is not cryptographically secure, which leads to private key leakage and even fund theft. This security problem has been well known in Bitcoin community and fixed by applying RFC 6979 update in 2013.
   In this paper, we systematically revisit the cases where random numbers are reused and evaluate them based on practical Bitcoin transactions. After analyzing Bitcoin transaction dataset from January 2009 to July 2017, we find that there are still approximately 0.48 percent of transactions involving this vulnerability, and 1331 private keys have been compromised. In addition, the transactions related to some involved addresses have a common pattern, which gives us a clue that a spam transaction attack may take advantage of ECDSA weak randomness. We also examine mainstream Bitcoin software wallets to check whether they are susceptible to ECDSA weak randomness. Even the result is quite optimistic, an example that one of the influenced addresses leaked in April 2014 is still in use again in August 2017 reflects that the severity of ECDSA weak randomness may not be paid enough attention even after its discovery and solution in 2013.

AB Currently, the burden on the cheque clearing houses in financial institutions is increasing day-by-day, which necessitates the upgrading of the existing cheque truncation system (CTS). It is a manual process which uses Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR), where cheques have been scanned and sent to the clearing house for further processing. The limitations of existing CTS are - illegal duplication of cheque images, invisible ink usage, visibility issues in beneficiary name, and amount on the cheque. To handle the aforementioned issues of the existing CTS, blockchain has emerged as a new technology which is a distributed ledger that is timestamped and immutable. Being immutable, forgeries related to images of cheques during clearance cycles are not allowed. This provides trust and consensus among all participating entities in the network. Motivated by the above discussion, in this paper, we propose a framework named MudraChain for automated cheque clearance, where clearance operations are handled by the blockchain network, instead of existing CTS. It includes: (i) A multi-level authentication scheme to make the blockchain-based framework secure and tamper-proof among participating financial stakeholders, (ii) A quick-response (QR) code generation algorithm which performs digital signing of a cheque, and (iii) A novel two-factor authentication protocol to generate a time based one-time password (TOTP) for secure funds transfer. The obtained results are examined against state-of-the-art approaches to indicate the supremacy of the proposed framework. Thus, MudraChain allows a seamless flow of clearance operation via blockchain for the payer and the payee without any intermediaries. Finally, it addresses the requirements of building a secure application for cheque clearance in view of decentralized blockchain 4.0 applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the rapid development of cloud computing for many years, data security and trusted computing are still the main challenges in current cloud computing applications. In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter's secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a "block-and-response" mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB DNS root faces security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to centralized management architecture. Several related schemes have been proposed to alleviate the security vulnerabilities and trust risks. However, there are still some open issues, including tamper-proofing, security, deployability, etc. To address these issues, this paper presents a trustworthy decentralized DNS root management architecture called TD-Root based on permissioned blockchain. TD-Root is a tamper-proofing architecture and can tolerate one-third of malicious root servers behaving arbitrarily. Different from the current centralized distribution method, every root server maintains the consistent same root zone file through consensus algorithm, eliminating the security vulnerabilities and trust risks in current centralized management architecture. Correspondingly, we design a novel consensus algorithm, in which credence value and penalty mechanism are introduced to ensure the strong consistency, scalability, and security of TD-Root. Furthermore, a compatible deployment scheme which optimizes the lookup performance based on the blockchain data structure is proposed, reducing the deployment complexity and difficulty. Finally, TD-Root is implemented in Golang and validated through simulation using Google Cloud. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Presently, BlockChain (BC) gained significant interest because of its undeniable nature and related advantages of security and privacy, BC has the power to resolve the limitations of Internet of Things (IoT) such as data protection and privacy. At the same time, BC has high computation complexity, restricted scalability, high bandwidth overhead and latency that is unsuitable to IoT. In this paper, efficient Lightweight integrated Blockchain (ELIB) model is developed to meet necessitates of IoT. The presented model is deployed in a smart home environment as an important illustration to verify its applicability in various IoT scenarios. The resource constrained resources in a smart home takes the advantages from a centralized manager which generates shared keys to transmit data, process every incoming and outgoing requests. The presented ELIB model generates an overlay network where highly equipped resources can merges to a public BC which verifies dedicated security and privacy. A set of three optimizations are carried out in the presented ELIB model include lightweight consensus algorithm, certificateless (CC) cryptography and Distributed Throughput Management (DTM) scheme. A detailed simulation takes place under different scenarios in terms of processing time, energy usage and overhead. The ELIB attains a total of 50% saving in processing time on comparing to baseline method with the minimum energy consumption of 0.07mJ. The obtained experimental outcome indicated that the ELIB shows maximum performance under several evaluation parameters. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ubiquitous use of Internet of Things (loT) ranges from industrial control systems to e-Health, e-commerce, smart cities, agriculture, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber-physical systems and a lot more. However, the data collected and processed by loT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present "PrivySharing," a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure loT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users' data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named "PrivyCoin" for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   review
AB Blockchain as a distributed computing platform enables users to deploy pieces of software (known as smart contracts) for a wealth of next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party. The advantages of smart contracts do, however, come at a price. As with most technologies, there are potential security threats, vulnerabilities and various other issues associated with smart contracts. Writing secure and safe smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to various business logics, as well as platform vulnerabilities and limitations. Formal methods have recently been advocated to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between 2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs) for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth research. Our study also provides possible future research directions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blockchain security has been drawing a tremendous attention from industry and academic due to its prevalence on real-world applications in these years, such as distributed blockchain-based storage systems. Since being deployed in distributed and decentralized network, blockchain applications may be vulnerable to various types of network attacks. This paper deals with "eclipse attacks" enabling a malicious actor to isolate a system user by taking control of all outgoing connections. Although being known from practical blockchain applications, eclipse attacks, so far, are hard to be detected. To solve this problem, this paper designs an eclipse-attack detection model for Ethereum platform, ETH-EDS, based on random forest classification algorithm. Specifically, via the collection and investigation over the normal and attack data packets (across the network), we find out that the information in the attack packets includes the tags packets_size, access_frequencies and access_time, which may help us effectively detect the attack. After training the data packets which we collect from the network, our ETH-EDS is able to detect malicious actor with high probability. Our experimental analysis presents evidence to show that the detection of malicious network node (i.e., the malicious actor) is with high accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB Security is one of the most challenging issues in software defined networking (SDN), and causes include the inability to detect the contents of the packets. In addition, file transferring to SDN is a potential attack vector that can be exploited at the network level. On the SDN data plane (i.e. the switch), packets are processed so that their behavior in the network can be determined. Packet parser (PP) acts as the main role of this operation on the switch. PP plays a very important role in identifying packets and supporting protocols and testing new ideas in SDN, which requires packet parsers on the data plane to provide the necessary flexibility and programmability. In recent times, cryptographic ledger technology (also referred to as Blockchain in the literature) has been applied to securely transfer transactions and files in the networks, mainly for crypto payments. In this paper, we propose a new packet parser architecture called Blockchain-enabled Packet Parser (BPP) based on the security characteristics of the blockchain and support for data processing functions with the description of Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) language that has the BPP-independent attribute of the protocol. In the proposed architecture, we provide a mathematical model based on a multivariate correlation approach for attack detection from the observed packet traffic. The implementation of BPP architecture is on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is known for its higher processing speed, flexibility, and lower consumption resources. The result indicates that the proposed BPP is able to detect attacks and policy performed on the control plane in how to detect an attack from a packet structure efficiently. Furthermore, the impact of the bandwidth with and without the BPP in hardware environment is evaluated to demonstrate BPP's efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transaction privacy protection has always been the subject of interest in blockchain-based transaction system. The one-time public key method commonly used in current system does not perfectly achieve this function. Other technologies such as Mixcoin and zk-SNARKs also confront with some centralization and efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a new organization-level privacy protection mechanism for blockchain-based transaction system, which realizes the transformation of transactions between users to transactions between organizations, and further achieves a balance between privacy protection and security supervision. Specifically, we formalize the definition of this system architecture and give its generic construction and concrete implementation through the basic cryptography modules such as digital signature, public key encryption, group signature, zero-knowledge proof and range proof of committed value. Analysis and experiment results show that our system satisfies three important properties of protocol security, transaction privacy and identity traceability, which makes it suitable for various trading scenarios, especially for public-to-public transactions.

AB The idea of smart home existed from 1970's onwards but has come into the knowledge of researchers and data scientist due to the development in the domain of internet of things (IoT) (Kopetz, 2011), but it still suffers from privacy and security vulnerabilities. Conventional security policies or approaches are not applicable to IoT, mainly due to its decentralised topology and the resource constraints of the majority of its devices (Dorri et al., 2017a). This Paper presents an innovative, novel and decentralised approach that can be used to augment the existing security architecture of a smart home network. Our scheme guarantees both trustworthiness and user privacy preservations.

TI CAREER GUIDANCE PROBLEM AS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY
SO REVISTA INCLUSIONES
LA English
DT Article
DE Career guidance; Career guidance system; Career guidance counseling
AB The purpose of the article is to analyze the difficulties and current trends in the organization of career guidance in modern conditions. It has been established that the problems result in mistakes in career choice, which is not only an adverse factor for personal development, but also damages the development of the country's economy, provoking a mismatch between the objective need of the state for a balanced representation of different professional groups and the subjective professional desires of young people. The authors draw attention to the decline in the prestige of significant professions (including the profession of a teacher). The noted disagreement specifies the need to search for new approaches, including the following initiatives: the Ticket to the Future project, the blockchain technology, the Unified State Examination development, work with parents of senior pupils, the introduction of career guidance online services, etc. It is argued that the prospects of career guidance are related to the elimination of its main drawback - the lack of a system. This leads to the development of a new direction of activity in terms of pedagogical universities, which can become regional career guidance centers, providing the methodological guidance and coordination activities, accompanying and supporting career guidance schools, as well as creating training programs for career counseling specialists (career counselors). The necessity of applying a system-activity approach to career guidance, based on the continuity of all levels of education, is substantiated. Having a high personnel potential, a pedagogical university can fulfill the task of multilevel career guidance in a varied space of continuing education by filling the career guidance projects with the relevant content, giving them pedagogical expediency and psychological justification in accordance with the needs and abilities of each individual subject of career guidance, taking into account the economic interests of the state.
