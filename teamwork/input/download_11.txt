AB The paper analyzes legal issues associated with the application of existing contract law provisions to so-called Smart contracts, defined in the paper as 'agreements existing in the form of software code implemented on the Blockchain platform, which ensures the autonomy and self-executive nature of Smart contract terms based on a predetermined set of factors'. The paper consists of several sections. In the second section, the paper outlines the peculiarities of Blockchain technology, as currently implemented in Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which forms the core of Smart contracts. In the third section, the main characteristic features of Smart contracts are described. Finally, the paper outlines key tensions between classic contract law and Smart contracts. The concluding section sets the core question for analysis of the perspectives of implementation of this technology by governments: 'How to align the powers of the government with Blockchain if there is no central authority but only distributed technologies'. The author suggests two solutions, neither of which is optimal: (1) providing the state authorities with the status of a Superuser with extra powers; and (2) relying on traditional remedies and enforcement practices, by pursuing specific individuals - parties to a Smart contract - in offline mode.

DE Bitcoin; Mining pool; Duplicate share; Attacker strategy
AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based in peer-to-peer network that uses a blockchain. To maintain the blockchain without trusted third parties, a player called a miner proves that he has completed a proof-of-work. As the difficulty of proof-of-work is increasing, mining pools, consisting of a number of miners, have become major players compared with solo miners. Most mining pools consist of a manager and miners. All miners who belong to a mining pool submit their shares to the manager and get paid in proportion to the amount of their shares. Therefore, the manager has to pay all miners fairly.
   However, many Bitcoin mining pools were ruined by an attack called the Duplicate Share Attack (DSA) in 2015. In this paper, we analyze DSA in multiple directions. First, we mathematically analyze DSA against one mining pool and multiple mining pools. As results of our analyses, we derive the optimal attacker's strategy, which shows that DSA can give a large extra profit to an attacker with little computational power. Because the duplicate share vulnerability has been already fixed in a few large mining pools after DSA was introduced, DSA may not be considered a threat any more. However, we show that several small mining pools are still vulnerable to DSA and an attacker can unfairly earn a large extra profit using these unpatched small mining pools. In summary, we argue that honest miners in Bitcoin network are not yet free from DSA.

TI Distributed ledger technology in payments, clearing and settlement

DE blockchain; distributed ledger; fintech; distributed ledger technology
   (DLT); payments, clearing and settlement
AB Digital innovations in finance, loosely known as "fintech", have garnered a great deal of attention across the financial industry. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is one such innovation that has been cited as a means of transforming payment, clearing and settlement (PCS) processes, including how funds are transferred and how securities, commodities and derivatives are cleared and settled. An important goal of this paper is to examine how this technology might be used in the area of PCS, and to identify both the opportunities and challenges facing its practical implementation and possible long-term adoption. DLT has the potential to provide new ways of transferring and recording the ownership of digital assets; immutably and securely storing information; providing for identity management; and facilitating other evolving operations through peer-to-peer networking, access to a distributed but common ledger among participants and cryptography. Potential use cases in PCS include cross-border payments and the post-trade clearing and settlement of securities. These use cases could address operational and financial frictions around existing services. Nonetheless, the industry's understanding and application of this technology is still in its infancy, and stakeholders are taking a variety of approaches toward its development. Given the technology's early stage, a number of challenges to development and adoption remain, including how issues around business cases, technological hurdles, legal considerations and risk management considerations are addressed. To understand fast-moving developments in this area, a team of Federal Reserve staff conducted a series of discussions with approximately thirty organizations, including financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, technology start-ups, established technology firms and other government agencies.

TI Tracking digital footprints: anonymity within the bitcoin system

LA English
DT Article
DE Cybercrime; Bitcoin; Anonymity; Terrorism financing; Cryptocurrency;
   Digital currency
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse research surrounding the anonymity of online transactions using Bitcoin and report on the feasibility of law enforcement bodies tracing illicit transactions back to a user's real-life identity.
   Design/methodology/approach - The design of this paper follows on from the approach taken by Reid and Harrigan (2013) in determining whether identifying information may be collated with external sources of data to identify individual users. In addition to conducting a detailed literature review surrounding the anonymity of users, and the potential ability to track transactions through the blockchain, four Bitcoin exchange services are examined to ascertain whether information provided at the sign-up stage is sufficiently verified and reliable. By doing so, this research tests the ability for law enforcement to reasonably rely upon this information when attempting to prosecute individuals. Additionally, by submitting fake information for verification, the plausibility of these services accepting fraudulent or illegitimate information is also tested.
   Findings - It may be possible to identify and prosecute bad actors through the analysis of transaction histories by tracing them back to an interaction with a Bitcoin exchange. However, the compliance and implementation of anti-money laundering legislation and customer identification security standards are insufficiently used within some exchange services, resulting in more technologically adept, or well-funded, criminals being able to circumvent identification controls and continue to transact without revealing their identities. The introduction of and compliance with know-your customer and customer due diligence legislation is required before law enforcement bodies may be able to accurately rely on information provided to a Bitcoin exchange. This paper highlights the need for research to be undertaken to examine the ways in which criminals are circumventing identity controls and, consequently, financing their illicit activities.
   Originality/value - By ascertaining the types of information submitted by users when exchanging real currency for virtual currency, and seeing whether this information may be accepted despite being fraudulent in nature, this paper elucidates the reliability of information that law enforcement bodies may be able to access when tracing transactions back to an individual actor.

AB The rise of distributed ledger technology, initiated and exemplified by the Bitcoin blockchain, is having an increasing impact on information technology environments in which there is an emphasis on trust and security. Management of electronic health records, where both conformation to legislative regulations and maintenance of public trust are paramount, is an area where the impact of these new technologies may be particularly beneficial. We present a system that enables fine-grained personalized control of third party access to patients' electronic health records, allowing individuals to specify when and how their records are accessed for research purposes. The use of the smart contract based Ethereum blockchain technology to implement this system allows it to operate in a verifiably secure, trustless, and openly auditable environment, features crucial to health information systems moving forward.

AB If a blockchain is well-implemented, the resulting advantages include speed, privacy, reliability, and much lower costs. As more global enterprises adopt blockchain technology, it is necessary to evaluate and address not only benefits but the associated risks too. Effective solutions can be proposed based on the analysis of potential risks in the used blockchain ecosystem by its modelling.
   In the paper, the approach for risk modelling of blockchain ecosystem is described. Practical realization of simulation on the base of Petri Net model is proposed. Process of E-net model design for analysis of blockchain platform and critical aspects of a blockchain solution includes the next main components: formal construction of the individual blocks process formation in the blockchain; formal construction for transformation probability of various possible risks in the blockchain ecosystem into the generator of risk events; formal metamodeling of blockchain operation with critical aspects of a blockchain solution; base set of modelling elements for above-mentioned transformation procedure; and software tools for simulation experiment. The detailed rules for design of Petri Net model are proposed and used structure of ATM communication network is performed.

AB The article 1 aims to study the MCIN modeling method and design the MCIN-based architecture of smart agriculture (MCIN-ASA) which is different from current vertical architecture and involves production, management and commerce. Architecture is composed of three MCIN-ASA participants which are MCIN-ASA enterprises, individuals and commodity. In addition, architecture uses enterprises and individuals personalized portals as the carriers which are linked precisely with each other through a peer-to-peer network called six-degrees-of-separation block-chain. The authors want to establish a self-organization, open and ecological operational system which includes active, personalized consumption, direct, centralized distribution, distributed and smart production. The paper models three main MCIN-ASA participants, design the smart supply, demand and management functions, which shows the feasibility innovation and high efficiency of implementing MCIN on agriculture. The authors think that MCIN-ASA improves current agriculture greatly, and inspires a lot in production-marketing-combined electronic commerce.

AB The knowledge economy requires new flexible approaches to standardization and certification. The labor market needs to define clear criteria for the competence of graduates as potential employees and participants in the business community. The requirements of employers for the skills and competencies of job candidates are reflected in vacancy announcements. The analysis demonstrates significant differences between the description of the functional roles at the workplace, given by the business, and the content of both professional and educational standards, approved by the State. The professionalizing of education requires the development of a flexible system of formulating the competences that are necessary for innovative growth of the economy, which would reflect the business' needs in the human resource and would allow the most accurate provision of opportunities for individuals' self-realization in the talent management system on corporate, regional or global level. Masterchain platform is developed in Russia as a model of distributed data, as a reliable and flexible system to record events (e.g., a register of property rights or the diploma' issuance) seems to be a convenient regulatory mechanism to harmonize the expectations of enterprises and personal interests of individuals. The paper examines the possibilities to put into operation the Masterchain platform and to form on its basis a business intelligence system to analyze and harmonize the competencies required by employers and reflected in their vacancy announcements with the individuals' personal talents and interests presented in the portfolio.

AB Blockchain technology allows the implementation of a public ledger securely recording transactions among peers without the need of trusted third parties. For both researchers and industry, IoT appears a domain in which there would be extraordinary benefits if the features of Blockchain can be exploited. Indeed, the possibility that IoT devices participate in public shared transactions enables a lot of challenging applications. However, there are some aspects that may limit the use of Blockchain in IoT. These are mainly related to the low computational power and storage capabilities of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to implement a public ledger overcoming the above drawbacks, thus appearing more suitable to IoT applications. The proposed protocol leverages the popular social network Twitter and works by building a meshed chain of tweets to ensure transaction security. Importantly, Twitter does not play neither the role of trusted third party nor the role of ledger provider.

AB The recent approval of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes new data protection requirements on data controllers and processors with respect to the processing of European Union (EU) residents' data. These requirements consist of a single set of rules that have binding legal status and should be enforced in all EU member states. In light of these requirements, we propose in this paper the use of a blockchain-based approach to support data accountability and provenance tracking. Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three models for our approach with different granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions. Our implementations show in practice the feasibility and limitations of contracts for the purposes identified in this paper.

AB Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.
   In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.

AB The emergence of artificial general intelligence and the global brain provides new opportunities for realizing humanity's long quest for a more utopian existence. One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI "Nanny" instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain.

AB Just like its recent predecessors, blockchain - also known as the distributed ledger technology - is considered to have the potential to cause major economic, political and social transformations in the Global South. The visible effects of this technology are already being noted there. We present early evidence linking the use of blockchain in overcoming some economic, social and political challenges facing the Global South. The article highlights the key applications and uses of blockchain in developing countries. It demonstrates how blockchain can help promote transparency, build trust and reputation, and enhance efficiency in transactions. The article looks at opportunities and key triggers for blockchain diffusion in these countries. It also delves into challenges and obstacles that developing economies are likely to encounter in the use of blockchain.

AB Introduction: this article offers a comparative analysis of systematization of the results of intellectual activity in the Russian Federation and abroad. Systems for the registration of creative works in various countries, including Russia, function in different areas. There are registers in libraries and archives, as well as those maintained by organizations for the collective management of rights. In Europe, for example, a register of so-called orphan works (works whose authors are unknown) has been created. At the same time, the fact that a variety of such registers exist often makes commercialization of copyrighted objects quite difficult, especially if the turnover in rights to such objects takes place predominantly on the Internet. This article considers various registration systems for the results of creative work and identifies possibilities for the application of blockchain technologies to the systematization of such results. Purpose: to identify regulatory models for the systematization of the results of creative work in the digital sphere for the purpose of using blockchain technologies for the registration of rights to the results of intellectual activity. Methods: the methodological framework of the research is based on dialectical, formal, functional and other general research methods, as well as special methods used by legal scholars: comparative law research and technical research. Results: the authors have identified and described the existing Russian and foreign mechanisms utilized for the systematization of the results of creative work. Based on the comparative analysis offered herein, the possibilities of using blockchain technologies to systematize the results of intellectual activity have been demonstrated for the purpose of the subsequent creation of a single register of intellectual property. Conclusions: the analysis of systematization of the results of intellectual activity in accordance with Russian law and laws of some foreign countries enables us to conclude that the use of blockchain technologies for the purpose of systematizing the results of intellectual activity makes it possible to store, disseminate and transfer information about copyright objects and their rightsholders, their disposal systems, users, etc., and, thusly, can be used instead of the existing databases for intellectual property. The systematization of the results of intellectual activity on the basis of blockchain technologies answers the necessary technical requirements, safety requirements, requirements to decentralization, provides various access levels, and eliminates the need to have a third party to verify the transactions. The use of blockchain technologies would make registration and maintenance of registers by organizations for collective management of copyright and related rights and other organizations much less expensive, and would help to eliminate unnecessary intermediaries in this area.

AB eHealth is a technology that is growing in importance over time, varying from remote access to Medical Records, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), or Electronic Medical Records (EMR), to real-time data exchange from different onbody sensors coming from different patients. With this huge amount of critical data being exchanged, problems and challenges arise. Privacy and confidentiality of this critical medical data are of high concern to the patients and authorized persons to use this data. On the other hand, scalability and interoperability are also important problems that should be considered in the final solution. This paper illustrates the specific problems and highlights the benefits of the blockchain technology for the deployment of a secure and a scalable solution for medical data exchange in order to have the best performance possible.

DE blockchain; consortium blockchain; consensus; voting mechanism
AB Bitcoin introduces a revolutionary decentralized consensus mechanism. However, Bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms applied to public blockchain are inadequate for the deployment scenarios of budding consortium blockchain. We propose a new consensus algorithm, Proof of Vote (POV). The consensus is coordinated by the distributed nodes controlled by consortium partners which will come to a decentralized arbitration by voting. The key idea is to establish different security identity for network participants, so that the submission and verification of the blocks are decided by the agencies' voting in the league without the depending on a third-party intermediary or uncontrollable public awareness. Compared with the fully decentralized consensus-Proof of Work (POW), POV has controllable security, convergence reliability, only one block confirmation to achieve the transaction finality, and low-delay transaction verification time.

AB Domain name system is an essential component of the Internet, but is facing numerous security threats. On the other hand, blockchain has been widely used since Bitcoin. Theoretically, most of the decentralized system can be rebuilt using blockchain. Namecoin and Blockstack have made attempts to combine domain name service with blockchain, but have defects in security and performance. In this paper, we propose a new domain name service based on a consortium chain network which contains query nodes and miner nodes. To address the storage challenge of blockchain, the system is designed with three-layer architecture and additional external storage. In addition, the system builds index for transactions and blocks to speed up domain name resolution and incorporates gossip protocol to synchronize blocks between different nodes.

An incremental learning algorithm is proposed to detect logos by just using a synthetic image template, without the need of annotating a training set. Then, a crowdsourced solution is generated to carry out the consensus of the executions of the incremental learning.

TI Fair Deposits against Double-Spending for Bitcoin Transactions

AB In Bitcoin network, the distributed storage of multiple copies of the blockchain opens up possibilities for double spending, i. e., a payer issues two separate transactions to two different payees transferring the same coins. To detect the doublespending and penalize the malicious payer, decentralized nonequivocation contracts have been proposed. The basic idea of these contracts is that the payer locks some coins in a deposit when he initiates a transaction with the payee. If the payer double spends, a cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions can be used to reveal his Bitcoin credentials for the deposit. Thus, the malicious payer could be penalized by the loss of deposit coins. However, such decentralized non-equivocation contracts are subjected to collusion attacks where the payer colludes with the beneficiary of the deposit and transfers the Bitcoin deposit back to himself when he double spends, resulting in no penalties. On the other hand, even if the beneficiary behaves honestly, the victim payee cannot get any compensation directly from the deposit in the original design. To prevent such collusion attacks, we design fair deposits for Bitcoin transactions to defend against double-spending. The fair deposits ensure that the payer will be penalized by the loss of his deposit coins if he double spends and the victim payee's loss will be compensated. We start with proposing protocols of making a deposit for Bitcoin transactions. We then analyze the performance of deposits made for Bitcoin transactions and show how the fair deposits work efficiently in Bitcoin.

AB Within "Industrie 4.0" approach 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB Edge computing proposes a novel model for providing computational resources close to end devices that are connected to the network It has numerous applications in Internet of Things, as well as smart grids, healthcare, smart home, etc. This paper presents ongoing research regarding the use of blockchain technology as a platform hierarchical and distributed control systems based on IEC 61499 standard. Hyperledger Fabric was selected as the blockchain solution, where function blocks are to be implemented as smart contracts on a supervisor level. The integration with the edge nodes that perform on the executive level responsible for actual process control is based on a micro-services architecture where Docker containers implement function blocks, and Kubernetes platform is used for orchestrating the execution of containers across the edge resources.

DE bitcoin; blockchain functionality extension; statechain;
   application-level consensus; cryptocurrencies cross-chain exchange
AB Blockchain has attracted great attention as the basis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but its capabilities extend far beyond that. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize applications because it provides a transparent, immutable, and append-only ledger that can be used to build new decentralized applications. However, it is hard to implement changes to Bitcoin without forking blockchain. As a result, Bitcoin has difficulty in adapting to new demands and extending new functionality.
   The traditional way to introduce new functionality is to modify Bitcoins code base, but which will lead to some problems such as (a) the security of blockchains, (b) the allocation of currency, and (c) the waste of resources. We present a novel design, statechain, which uses Bitcoin blockchain to propagate application log. It can add new functionality without requiring blockchain fork changes from Bitcoin. Statechain enables application nodes to efficiently query the log as well as transfer log between blockchains. We detail how the application nodes achieve application-level consensus at each block. As far as we know, this technology has not been exploited. However, it has a great practical significance that enables the introduction of new functionality safer and makes the development of blockchain-based applications easier. We have used statechain to explore the field of transferring bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies directly between multiple blockchains.

DE smart contract; blockchain; scalability
AB Blockchain, or distributed ledger, provides a way to build various decentralized systems without relying on any single trusted party. This is especially attractive for smart contracts, that different parties do not need to trust each other to have a contract, and the distributed ledger can guarantee correct execution of the contract. Most existing distributed ledger based smart contract systems process smart contracts in a serial manner, i.e., all users have to run a contract before its result can be accepted by the system. Although this approach is easy to implement and manage, it is not scalable and greatly limits the system's capability of handling a large number of smart contracts. In order to address this problem, we propose a scalable smart contract execution scheme that can run multiple smart contract in parallel to improve throughput of the system. Our scheme relies on two key techniques: a fair contract partition algorithm leveraging integer linear programming to partition a set of smart contracts into multiple subsets, and a random assignment protocol assigning subsets randomly to a subgroup of users. We prove that, our scheme is secure as long as more than 50% of the computational power is possessed by honest nodes. We then conduct experiments with data from existing smart contract system to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme. The results demonstrate that our approach is scalable and much more efficient than the existing smart contract platform.

DE Blockchain; CP-ABE; Accountability; Electronic Documents; Traceability
AB As a recently proposed public key primitive, attribute-base encryption(ABE) divided into Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) and Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) is a highly promising tool for the management and protection of data. And Blockchain, as one of the core technologies of Bitcoin that is the most representative cryptocurrency, has received extensive attentions recently. Supervision and privacy protection are two difficulties in blockchain. In this paper, a new scheme combining blockchain and accountable CP-ABE is proposed. In this scheme, each change of the data is recorded on the blockchain. And the different permissions of access are realized through ABE. If a malicious user shares a decryption key illegally, it will be considered illegal. Similarly, if the authority generates a decryption key for any unauthorized user, it also will be considered illegal. This scheme allows any third party to publicly verify the identity of a decryption key. And it is achievable for an auditor to publicly audit whether a malicious user or the authority should be responsible for an exposed decryption key, and the key abuser cannot deny it. At last this scheme is applied to the management of electronic documents.

AB Government information resource (GIR) sharing, an important means for efficient government working, requires new technology to enhance its reliability and security. Blockchain, as an emerging technology for building decentralized applications, is gradually penetrating various fields. In this paper, we present a technical combination that consists of Blockchain structure, network sharing model and consensus algorithms. With these techniques, we design and implement a Blockchain-based GIR sharing system (BGIRSS), which is decentralized, to make the sharing procedure more efficient. The results of a series of emulational experiments show that our system is securer and more reliable than conventional sharing schemes, and can effectively promote the sharing efficiency of GIRs with lower implementation cost.

AB The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to demand side management of smart grid and to present an example that blockchain is used to facilitate machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction and frame an electricity market in the context of demand request. We use blockchain technology to record data derived from power flow calculation model and electricity price customization, and use smart contract to store transaction data and transfer assets automatically. Firstly, we establish a power flow calculation for microgrid operation system of 34 node master-slave control island, and the power flow is calculated and an optimal generator work adjustment is used. Then, according to the price customization, the participation mode of priced demand response is acquired. The presented scenario includes that a power management system and a generator which can actively adjust the power generation trading with each other over a blockchain. According to flow calculation and price customization, power management system generate smart contracts automatically. The final is that two sides complete the transaction and the load state of grid has been adjusted. This work contributes a proof-of-concept implementation of the scenario. This example verifies the feasibility of the method.

AB Credible reputation lies at the core of users and devices communicating and transacting successfully. Identity fraud is becoming increasingly difficult to manage in the face of massive-scale database breaches. In critical infrastructure and public safety applications, as well as day-to-day personal and business transactions, it is imperative to have a significant degree of confidence in whom/what one communicates with - whether to know if the recipient can be entrusted with the sender's data, or if the sender's data is to be considered reliably sourced. Even where possible, lost reputation is substantially more cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive to replace than are compromised, stolen or defective devices and their embedded cryptographic keys. This paper focuses on two methodologies that have considerable implications relative to addressing the reputation issue: (1) blockchain-enabled anomaly detection and assessment that involves dynamically asserted identity at the network edge effected through end-user targeted release of trusted behavioral data; (2) IoT and human interaction that is securely facilitated through use of an "Inviter-Invitee" protocol to set up dedicated maintainable "communication lines." The judiciously applied combination of the cryptographic protocol suites that enable the two methodologies results in a practicably implementable system for smart city use cases.

AB Real world physical shopping offers customers the privilege of maintaining their privacy by giving them the option of using cash, and thus providing no personal information such as their names and home addresses. On the contrary, electronic shopping mandates the use of all sorts of personally identifiable information for both billing and shipping purposes. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created a stimulated growth in private billing by enabling pseudonymous payments. However, the anonymous delivery of the purchased physical goods is still an open research problem. In this work, we present a blockchain-based physical delivery system called Lelantos(1) that within a realistic threat model, offers customer anonymity, fair exchange and merchant-customer unlinkability. Our system is inspired by the onion routing techniques which are used to achieve anonymous message delivery. Additionally, Lelantos relies on the decentralization and pseudonymity of the blockchain to enable pseudonymity that is hard to compromise, and the distributed consensus mechanisms provided by smart contracts to enforce fair irrefutable transactions between distrustful contractual parties.

   (DLREP)
AB The most fundamental purpose of blockchain technology is to enable persistent, consistent, distributed storage of information. Increasingly common are authentication systems that leverage this property to allow users to carry their personal data on a device while a hash of this data is signed by a trusted authority and then put on a blockchain to be compared against. For instance, in 2015, MIT introduced a schema for the publication of their academic certificates based on this principle. In this work, we propose a way for users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can then be validated against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to provide anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of identity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting users control a secret of their own. We show how our schema can be implemented on Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by grouping commitments using Merkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin transactions that need to be sent. Finally, we describe a system in which users can gain access to services thanks to the identity records of our proposal.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Applications of blockchain are not only restricted to cybercurrencies, but have also been extended to other areas such as finance, e-health, music, and other business. One of the key components of blockchain is the design for miners who are responsible for adding new transactions (blocks) by solving a puzzle and receive some rewards in return. As a result, miners tend to join centralized mining pools to outsource their computing resources in order to gain more steady rewards, which may affect the security and fairness of the system. This motivates the researchers to propose nonoutsourceable puzzles. However, existing nonoutsourceable puzzles do not work well under the high-rate transaction processing protocol (GHOST). In this paper, we propose the first nonoutsourceable puzzle that can satisfy all security requirements of GHOST. Our experimental results show that our puzzle is practical.

AB In this paper, we propose a decentralized identity management system based on Blockchain. The function of the system mainly includes identity authentication and reputation management. The technical advantages of the Blockchain makes the data in the system safe and credible. In addition, we use smart contracts to write system rules to ensure the reliability of user information. We bind the user's entity information with the public key address and determine the true identity of a virtual user on the Blockchain. We use the token to represent the reputation which is shown to be an effective reputation model, making the participants in the system prefer to maintain and manage their personal reputation. Our system makes it possible for users to securely manage their identity and reputation on the Internet.

AB If, as most experts agree, the mathematical basis of major blockchain systems is (probably if not provably) sound, why do they have a bad reputation? Human misbehavior (such as failed Bitcoin exchanges) accounts for some of the issues, but there are also deeper and more interesting vulnerabilities here. These include design faults and code-level implementation defects, ecosystem issues (such as wallets), as well as approaches such as the "51% attack" all of which can compromise the integrity of blockchain systems. With particular attention to the emerging non-financial applications of blockchain technology, this paper demonstrates the kinds of attacks that are possible and provides suggestions for minimizing the risks involved.

ID RELATIONAL CONTRACT; SHADOW
AB This paper critiques blockchain-based "smart contracts," which aim to automatically and securely execute obligations without reliance on a centralized enforcement authority. Though smart contracts do have some features that might serve the goals of social justice and fairness, I suggest that they are based on a thin conception of what law does, and how it does it. Smart contracts focus on the technical form of contract to the exclusion of the social contexts within which contracts operate, and the complex ways in which people use them. In the real world, contractual obligations are enforced through all kinds of social mechanisms other than formal adjudication-and contracts serve many functions that are not explicitly legal in nature, or even designed to be formally enforced. I describe three categories of contracting practices in which people engage (the inclusion of facially unenforceable terms, the inclusion of purposefully underspecified terms, and willful nonenforcement of enforceable terms) to illustrate how contracts actually "work." The technology of smart contracts neglects the fact that people use contracts as social resources to manage their relations. The inflexibility that they introduce, by design, might short-circuit a number of social uses to which law is routinely put. Therefore, I suggest that attention to the social and relational contexts of contracting are essential considerations for the discussion, development, and deployment of smart contracts.

AB The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in the past 6 years, during which it has become a global interest to both scholars and practitioners as an alternative to fiat currencies and payment systems. A content analysis is conducted to examine the development and evolution of bitcoin over time to reveal possible trends and changes. Reviewing 143 academic papers, we find that the most dominant research themes were economic and regulatory dimensions of Bitcoin.

AB The Blockchain technology has witnessed boost in adaptability with respect to its application especially in distributed public ledgers dealing in the financial and academic sectors. However, the major drawbacks of this technology cause hindrance for sustaining in a longer run. Which is why applications solely built on Blockchain might also witness a decrease in their adaptability. Tangle, on the other hand, provides a more suitable and reliable system which also address the drawbacks of Blockchain.
   In this paper, we propose a framework to authenticate academic degrees and certificates build on Tangle so that the intermediate and middle parties which verify the transaction or data are eliminated, having a decentralized control with complete visibility to all the actors involved in the system. Additionally, Tangle provides a quantum resistant architecture that too without any significant charge.

AB Everyday number of smart devices or IOT devices either it be a smart phone, tablet, smart home device or any wearable technology are being connected to the internet. These IOT devices have become an essential part of our everyday life. We use them in many forms without being aware that we have started depending on them like for security purpose we use security systems in our house, or the smarts locks on our doors to keep our self-safe from the moon lighters. But do we really consider our security that seriously. Today IOT device security has become one of the major concern of the IT Industry. In this paper, we are using the block chain technique to develop a framework for security and management of data on the internet. We have developed a framework which shows how smart devices communicate with each other with block chain posing as the backbone. The framework serves as a scalable and robust solution, in order to address identity and security concerns of IOT. The proposed framework is further compared to existing models.

AB We propose the formal study of blockchains that are owned and controlled by organizations and that neither create cryptocurrencies nor provide incentives to solvers of cryptographic puzzles. We view such approaches as frameworks in which system parts, such as the cryptographic puzzle, may be instantiated with different technology. Owners of such a blockchain procure puzzle solvers as resources they control, and use a mathematical model to compute optimal parameters for the cryptographic puzzle mechanism or other parts of the blockchain. We illustrate this approach with a use case in which blockchains record hashes of financial process transactions to increase their trustworthiness and that of their audits. For Proof of Work as cryptographic puzzle, we develop a detailed mathematical model to derive MINLP optimization problems for computing optimal Proof of Work configuration parameters that trade off potentially conflicting aspects such as availability, resiliency, security, and cost in this governed setting. We demonstrate the utility of such a mining calculus by applying it on some instances of this problem. We hope that our work may facilitate the creation of domain-specific blockchains for a wide range of applications such as trustworthy information in Internet of Things systems and bespoke improvements of legacy financial services.

AB The design and development of novel security and authentication protocols is a challenging task. Design flaws, security and privacy issues as well as incomplete specifications pose risks for its users. Authcoin is a blockchain-based validation and authentication protocol for secure identity assurance. Formal methods, such as Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), are suitable to design, develop and analyze such new protocols in order to detect flaws and mitigate identified security risks. In this work, the Authcoin protocol is formalized using Colored Petri Nets resulting in a verifiable CPN model. An Agent-Oriented Modeling (AOM) methodology is used to create goal models and corresponding behavior models. Next, these models are used to derive the Authcoin CPN models. The modeling strategy as well as the required protocol semantics are explained in detail. Furthermore, we conduct a state-space analysis on the resulting CPN model and derive specific model properties. The result is a complete and correct formal specification that is used to guide future implementations of Authcoin.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in the development of various fields. The increasing scale and scope of applications make a great demand of IoT data exchange in recent years. Meanwhile, a number of IoT data exchange platforms which dedicated to connecting various and distributed data sources are emerging. In such a platform, service providers can search and exchange the data sets that they need. However, the centralized infrastructure cannot provide enough trust as the third-party intermediaries for data exchange. As a result, most platforms unable to satisfy the complex requirements due to few institutions and individuals are willing to share their IoT data sets in such an untrustworthy environment. This paper proposes a decentralized solution based on the blockchain for IoT data trusted exchange. Specifically, In this paper, the basic principles of blockchain and corresponding key technologies are expounded through in-depth analysis of three main reliable requirements in IoT data exchange. Besides, this paper provides an architecture of above solution and detailed design of its main trust component. Finally, it realizes a prototype by using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and presents its auditable, transparent, decentralized features visually.

AB Because of the distributed nature of cloud computing, the data of cloud may be stored and processed across jurisdictional borders. In such case, collecting digital evidence from cloud computing requires multiparty cooperation. However, as far as we known, there is still no available technic approach for improving the trustworthy of the interaction records of all stakeholders in cloud forensics. This work proposed a process provenance, which provides proof of existence and privacy preservation for process records by using technologies of blockchain and cryptography group signature. The process provenance enhances the trustworthy of the chain of custody for cloud forensics.

AB Scaling the transaction throughput of decentralized blockchain ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has been an ongoing challenge. Two-party duplex payment channels have been designed and used as building blocks to construct linked payment networks, which allow atomic and trust-free payments between parties without exhausting the resources of the blockchain.
   Once a payment channel, however, is depleted (e.g., because transactions were mostly unidirectional) the channel would need to be closed and re-funded to allow for new transactions. Users are envisioned to entertain multiple payment channels with different entities, and as such, instead of refunding a channel (which incurs costly on-chain transactions), a user should be able to leverage his existing channels to rebalance a poorly funded channel.
   To the best of our knowledge, we present the first solution that allows an arbitrary set of users in a payment channel network to securely rebalance their channels, according to the preferences of the channel owners. Except in the case of disputes (similar to conventional payment channels), our solution does not require on-chain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing blockchains. In our security analysis, we show that an honest participant cannot lose any of its funds while rebalancing. We finally provide a proof of concept implementation and evaluation for the Ethereum network.

DE Payment-Channel Network; Bitcoin; Scalability; Privacy; Concurrency
AB Permissionless blockchains protocols such as Bitcoin are inherently limited in transaction throughput and latency. Current efforts to address this key issue focus on off-chain payment channels that can be combined in a Payment-Channel Network (PCN) to enable an unlimited number of payments without requiring to access the blockchain other than to register the initial and final capacity of each channel. While this approach paves the way for low latency and high throughput of payments, its deployment in practice raises several privacy concerns as well as technical challenges related to the inherently concurrent nature of payments that have not been sufficiently studied so far.
   In this work, we lay the foundations for privacy and concurrency in PCNs, presenting a formal definition in the Universal Composability framework as well as practical and provably secure solutions. In particular, we present Fulgor and Rayo. Fulgor is the first payment protocol for PCNs that provides provable privacy guarantees for PCNs and is fully compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system. However, Fulgor is a blocking protocol and therefore prone to deadlocks of concurrent payments as in currently available PCNs. Instead, Rayo is the first protocol for PCNs that enforces non-blocking progress (i.e., at least one of the concurrent payments terminates). We show through a new impossibility result that non-blocking progress necessarily comes at the cost of weaker privacy. At the core of Fulgor and Rayo is Multi-Hop HTLC, a new smart contract, compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system, that provides conditional payments while reducing running time and communication overhead with respect to previous approaches. Our performance evaluation of Fulgor and Rayo shows that a payment with 10 intermediate users takes as few as 5 seconds, thereby demonstrating their feasibility to be deployed in practice.

AB Bitcoin owes its success to the fact that transactions are transparently recorded in the blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties. Unfortunately, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues. Building on recent proposals for "micropayment channels" - two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution - we introduce techniques for constructing anonymous payment channels. Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network. Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments via untrusted intermediaries. We build a concrete implementation of our scheme and show that it can be deployed via a soft fork to existing anonymous currencies such as ZCash.

AB Certification of keys and attributes is in practice typically realized by a hierarchy of issuers. Revealing the full chain of issuers for certificate verification, however, can be a privacy issue since it can leak sensitive information about the issuer's organizational structure or about the certificate owner. Delegatable anonymous credentials solve this problem and allow one to hide the full delegation (issuance) chain, providing privacy during both delegation and presentation of certificates. However, the existing delegatable credentials schemes are not efficient enough for practical use.
   In this paper, we present the first hierarchical (or delegatable) anonymous credential system that is practical. To this end, we provide a surprisingly simple ideal functionality for delegatable credentials and present a generic construction that we prove secure in the UC model. We then give a concrete instantiation using a recent pairing-based signature scheme by Groth and describe a number of optimizations and efficiency improvements that can be made when implementing our concrete scheme. The latter might be of independent interest for other pairing-based schemes as well. Finally, we report on an implementation of our scheme in the context of transaction authentication for blockchain, and provide concrete performance figures.

DE Confidential Transactions; Oblivious RAM; Blockchain
AB Blockchains and more general distributed ledgers are becoming increasingly popular as efficient, reliable, and persistent records of data and transactions. Unfortunately, they ensure reliability and correctness by making all data public, raising confidentiality concerns that eliminate many potential uses.
   In this paper we present Solidus, a protocol for confidential transactions on public blockchains, such as those required for asset transfers with on-chain settlement. Solidus operates in a framework based on real-world financial institutions: a modest number of banks each maintain a large number of user accounts. Within this framework, Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing. To achieve strong confidentiality of this kind, we introduce the concept of a Publicly-Verifiable Oblivious RAM Machine (PVORM). We present a set of formal security definitions for both PVORM and Solidus and show that our constructions are secure. Finally, we implement Solidus and present a set of benchmarks indicating that the system is efficient in practice.

DE Blockchain; BGP security; Origin authentication; RPKI
AB Origin authentication is one of the most concentrated and advocated BGP security approach against IP prefix hijacking. However, the potential risk of centralized authority abuse and the fragile infrastructure may lead a sluggish deployment of such BGP security approach currently. We propose BGPCoin, a trustworthy blockchain-based Internet resource management solution which provides compliant resource allocations and revocations, and a reliable origin advertisement source. By means of a smart contract to perform and supervise resource assignments on the tamper-resistant Ethereum blockchain, BGPCoin yields significant benefits in the secure origin advertisement and the dependable infrastructure for object repository compared with RPKI. We demonstrate through an Ethereum prototype implementation that the deployment incentives and increased security are technically and economically viable.

AB As blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies increase in popularity, their decentralization poses unique challenges in network partitions. In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful "forks" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions.
   In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities.

AB Bitcoin's innovative and distributedly maintained blockchain data structure hinges on the adequate degree of difficulty of so-called "proofs of work," which miners have to produce in order for transactions to be inserted. Importantly, these proofs of work have to be hard enough so that miners have an opportunity to unify their views in the presence of an adversary who interferes but has bounded computational power, but easy enough to be solvable regularly and enable the miners to make progress. As such, as the miners' population evolves over time, so should the difficulty of these proofs. Bitcoin provides this adjustment mechanism, with empirical evidence of a constant block generation rate against such population changes.
   In this paper we provide the first formal analysis of Bitcoin's target (re) calculation function in the cryptographic setting, i.e., against all possible adversaries aiming to subvert the protocol's properties. We extend the q-bounded synchronous model of the Bitcoin backbone protocol [Eurocrypt 2015], which posed the basic properties of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure and shows how a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them, to environments that may introduce or suspend parties in each round.
   We provide a set of necessary conditions with respect to the way the population evolves under which the "Bitcoin backbone with chains of variable difficulty" provides a robust transaction ledger in the presence of an actively malicious adversary controlling a fraction of the miners strictly below 50% at each instant of the execution. Our work introduces new analysis techniques and tools to the area of blockchain systems that may prove useful in analyzing other blockchain protocols.

ID COMMON KNOWLEDGE
AB At the heart of the Bitcoin is a blockchain protocol, a protocol for achieving consensus on a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. To the extent that a blockchain protocol is used for applications such as contract signing and making certain transactions (such as house sales) public, we need to understand what guarantees the protocol gives us in terms of agents' knowledge. Here, we provide a complete characterization of agent's knowledge when running a blockchain protocol using a variant of common knowledge that takes into account the fact that agents can enter and leave the system, it is not known which agents are in fact following the protocol (some agents may want to deviate if they can gain by doing so), and the fact that the guarantees provided by blockchain protocols are probabilistic. We then consider some scenarios involving contracts and show that this level of knowledge suffices for some scenarios, but not others.

AB With the popularity of electric vehicles, more and more charging piles were built. All of the private piles only serve for their owners, and are left unused for a longer time comparing to public piles. In order to keep private piles busier, meanwhile providing alternatives to electric vehicle users when charging, this paper designs a resolution for sharing private piles using block-chain and smart contract. Without the third party, we can do untrusted payment between strangers after charging; the access control strategy in this resolution protect the data privacy of transactions.

AB A revolutionary trustable sharable computing outcome, the blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions originated from digital events and shared among participating parties within a computing framework. Each transaction of the chain in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system and its constituents. Once recorded, information can never be erased and neither altered. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made during the business operations. In general sense, the blockchain could be described simply as being a way of storing the information of a transaction, between multiple parties in a trustable way. Recording, sharing, storing and redistributing contents in a secure and decentralized way. Being owned, run and monitored by everybody and without anyone controlling it. Besides, avoiding any kind of modifications or abuses from a central authority. Blockchain technology is non-controversial and has worked flawlessly over the last few years and is being successfully applied to both financial and non-financial world applications and listed as as the most important invention since the Internet itself. Besides, digital transformation is taking off as rapid agent for change as part of the global business convergence. In this article, detail of blockchain technologies is presented from the perspectives of digital business transformation along with its future evolutions.

AB The problem is discussed that large grid fluctuation caused by distributed generation integration, pointing out that the microgrid power local consumption is a solution to this problem. However, power transaction volume of electricity in microgrid is not large, while management has not simplified, and labor cost is high. The introduction of power market can solve local consumption problem of microgrid. Using blockchain technology can simplify the management of microgrid power transactions and realize peer-to-peer power transaction. Microgrid dispatch centers can also be simplified. The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to electricity market on microgrid and to present a framework how blockchain is employed to facilitate peer-to-peer electricity sales in microgrid.

AB Residential microgrids (MGs) may host a large number of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The strategy that maximizes the revenue for each individual DER is the one in which the DER operates at capacity, injecting all available power into the grid. However, when the DER penetration is high and the consumption low, this strategy may lead to power surplus that causes voltage increase over recommended limits. In order to create incentives for the DER to operate below capacity, we propose a proportional-fairness control strategy in which (i) a subset of DERs decrease their own power output, sacrificing the individual revenue, and (ii) the DERs in the subset are dynamically selected based on the record of their control history. The trustworthy implementation of the scheme is carried out through a custom-designed blockchain mechanism that maintains a distributed database trusted by all DERs. In particular, the blockchain is used to stipulate and store a smart contract that enforces proportional fairness. The simulation results verify the potential of the proposed framework.

AB The blockchain technology seems to be regarded by many, as a revolution, on the scale comparable to the advent of the Internet. The blockchain by itself is a rather simple data structure. The cryptocurrency design details account for the security of the underlying system. In this work, we present the design of our cryptographic system for use in Smart Grid environments. The mechanism is to incentivize distribution of greenfield energy, but also, to handle and encourage the required data transmission and storage. In our design, value of the cryptocurrency, as well as, of the energy itself, is determined solely by forces of supply and demand. Our design is unique in that, Smart Meters are the only trusted actors. We stress the importance of features required by, such a system; to be regarded as secure, distributed and indeed decentralized. We advocate, that a smart-meter is the only element required to be trusted; and that should hold true only in regard to making energy measurements. We show, why a cryptocurrency based system, which we have designed, is particularly suitable for energy-distribution scenarios, especially in limited-trust environments, where anonymity and security of data transmission are of the essence. Our hereby proposed system provides a fully distributed market for prosumers, costumers, power line owners and any other entities involved in both energy and data distribution. In this paper we focus on the architectural design.

AB Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.

AB Ethereum, the well-known blockchain platform, does not have any limit for block size, unlike Bitcoin. However, there are other obstacles in processing unlimited transactions per second. Ethereum blockchain code runs by different clients, and they run on different speed and present the different level of performance. This paper studies Ethereum transactions and it analyzes two most popular Ethereum clients, Geth and Parity, on a private blockchain to obtain the better understanding of the effect of different clients on Ethereum performance. The results show that the transactions are 89.8 percent on average faster in Parity client in comparison with Geth client, using the same system configuration.

AB This keynote paper addresses existing problems with traditional non-machine readable contracts that are based on trust. Such contracts have mostly a ceremonial purpose between transacting business parties and when conflicts occur, traditional contracts are often not enforcible. On the other hand, so called smart contracts that are machine readable and supported by blockchain-technology transactionalities, do not require qualitative trust between contracting parties as blockchain establish instead a quantitative notion of trust. However, currently existing smart-contract solutions that equip the protocol layer on top of blockchains with Turing-complete programming languages, lead to the false claim by industry practitioners they can manage smart contracts successfully. Instead, it is important to start considering the currently missing application layer for smart contracts.

AB A large number of people earn money in foreign countries and many of them have to send across the money back home in India. For every such transaction, multiple fees could be charged, varying from 3 to 12 percent. In this paper we offer a peer-to-peer settlement solution for such remittance on blockchain at negligible rates. Money transfers can be securely converted into crypto-currencies, which can easily be transferred across nations, and then again converted into local currencies. In this paper, we use Multi-chain for digital assets and peer-to-peer electronic cash systems where transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. Each block is verified and added to the blockchain (distributed public ledger), which includes all past transactions through a process known as Mining. Mining using CPU is unwise and has high cost of operation. We present an alternative approach using CUBA-enabled Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) for mining. The massively parallel nature of some GPUs majorly increases the mining power.

AB In this "post truth" age of "fake news" and "alternative facts" uncertainty in the provenance of policy makes transparency in decision making increasingly important for evidence-based policymakers. This paper demonstrates how the convergence of Agent Based Modelling, Smart Contracts, Blockchain, and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies make possible the development of participatory decision support frameworks. The concept is demonstrated in a public health context by implementing an Agent Based Model of disease spread within a simulated population (SIR model) as a so-called Smart Contract deployed on a public Blockchain network. We demonstrate that in order to "close the loop" the simulation outcomes can be visualized using commodity VR hardware, and future extensions towards fully interactive simulations are proposed.

AB An autonomous distributed system, such as an ad hoc network or peer-to-peer-based file sharing system, consists of nodes contributing to the system. However, egoistic nodes could collapse such a system. In this paper, we propose a protocol for an autonomous distributed messaging system for relaying messages between participants. It autonomously and distributedly provides and manages incentive for relaying using blockchain technology. We consider several types of fraud on the system and how to prevent them.

ID COOPERATION
AB The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm guarantees the safety and dependability of Blockchain systems. Miners can achieve a consensus through the PoW algorithm during the mining process, that is mutual attacking. However, when the miners attack each other, all miners earn less. In this paper, we established a model that mining between two miners is an iterative game, and proposed a subclass of ZD strategy (a pining strategy) to alleviate miners' dilemma, a miner can control another miner's payoff and increase the social revenue through a pinning strategy. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In summary, this work leads to the better understanding and analysis of the PoW algorithm via the game theory, rendering it possible to design a more rational consensus algorithm in the future.

DE Blockchain; Firmware verification; Embedded device
AB In this paper, a new firmware verification scheme is presented that utilizes blockchain technologies for securing network embedded devices. In the proposed scheme, an embedded device requests a firmware verification to nodes connected in a blockchain network and gets a response whether its firmware is up-to-date or not. If not latest, the embedded device can securely download and install the latest firmware from a firmware update server. Even in the case that the version of the firmware is up-to-date, its integrity is checked via the blockchain nodes. The proposed scheme guarantees that the embedded device's firmware is not tampered and latest. The effects of attacks targeting known vulnerabilities are thus minimized.

DE Credibility; Consensus mechanism; Blockchain scalability
AB Transactions may be altered, which leads to low credibility of transactions that restricts the rapid development and popularization of E-commerce. Although blockchain can ensure high stability and credibility of data, existing solutions still have some significant scalability barriers, such as low-throughput and high-latency. To improve credibility, this paper presents an e-commerce blockchain consensus mechanism (EBCM). EBCM does not rely on computing power and token but with the same level of security and credibility as Nakamoto consensus. Meanwhile, EBCM achieves real-time transaction and high-throughput. By introducing validation blockchain, we can ensure transactions cannot be altered. In order to realize high-throughput and real-time transaction, this paper constructs a two-layer blockchain. EBCM has been compared with Bitcoin in performance, and demonstrates better on throughput, latency.

AB With the increased use of Internet, governments and large companies store and share massive amounts of personal data in such a way that leaves no space for transparency. When a user needs to achieve a simple task like applying for college or a driving license, he needs to visit a lot of institutions and organizations, thus leaving a lot of private data in many places. The same happens when using the Internet. These privacy issues raised by the centralized architectures along with the recent developments in the area of serverless applications demand a decentralized private data layer under user control.
   We introduce the Private Data System (PDS), a distributed approach which enables self-sovereign storage and sharing of private data. The system is composed of nodes spread across the entire Internet managing local key-value databases. The communication between nodes is achieved through executable choreographies, which are capable of preventing information leakage when executing across different organizations with different regulations in place.
   The user has full control over his private data and is able to share and revoke access to organizations at any time. Even more, the updates are propagated instantly to all the parties which have access to the data thanks to the system design. Specifically, the processing organizations may retrieve and process the shared information, but are not allowed under any circumstances to store it on long term.
   PDS offers an alternative to systems that aim to ensure self-sovereignty of specific types of data through blockchain inspired techniques but face various problems, such as low performance. Both approaches propose a distributed database, but with different characteristics. While the blockchain-based systems are built to solve consensus problems, PDS's purpose is to solve the self-sovereignty aspects raised by the privacy laws, rules and principles.

AB Access Control systems are used in computer security to regulate the access to critical or valuable resources. The rights of subjects to access such resources are typically expressed through access control policies, which are evaluated at access request time against the current access context. This paper proposes a new approach based on blockchain technology to publish the policies expressing the right to access a resource and to allow the distributed transfer of such right among users. In our proposed protocol the policies and the rights exchanges are publicly visible on the blockchain, consequently any user can know at any time the policy paired with a resource and the subjects who currently have the rights to access the resource. This solution allows distributed auditability, preventing a party from fraudulently denying the rights granted by an enforceable policy. We also show a possible working implementation based on XACML policies, deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain.

TI A Novel Blockchain-Based Product Ownership Management System (POMS) for

AB For more than a decade now, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been quite effective in providing anti-counterfeits measures in the supply chain. However, the genuineness of RFID tags cannot be guaranteed in the post supply chain, since these tags can be rather easily cloned in the public space. In this paper, we propose a novel product ownership management system (POMS) of RFID-attached products for anti-counterfeits that can be used in the post supply chain. For this purpose, we leverage the idea of Bitcoin's blockchain that anyone can check the proof of possession of balance. With the proposed POMS, a customer can reject the purchase of counterfeits even with genuine RFID tag information, if the seller does not possess their ownership. We have implemented a proof-of-concept experimental system employing a blockchain-based decentralized application platform, Ethereum, and evaluated its cost performance. Results have shown that, typically, the cost of managing the ownership of a product with up to six transfers is less than U.S. $1.

AB The generation of information is growing at a surprising pace. The emotional ascent of unstructured information like photographs, recordings and online networking has introduced another type of non-social databases and which are named as "Big Data". In 2012, the measure of data put away overall surpassed 2.8 Zetabytes. By 2020, the aggregate sum of information put away is required to be 50 times bigger than today. Big Data must be prepared and analysed to deliver potential ideas and extreme information must be comprehended from this sea of information. A famous system Hadoop is utilized as of now to process such huge information. Here we execute LIBRA with various approaches that altogether lessen the information skew-(a typical issue in mapreduce) by element part methodology without pre-processing the whole data. To give question preparing, another algorithm Block-Chain is introduced.

AB Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency operating on a peer to peer network, which is currently integrated across a number of businesses and exchange markets. New bitcoins is created by participants who contribute computational resources to maintain a public blockchain as miners. Miners collaborate in a mining pool to reduce their variance and earn steadier rewards in Bitcoin. Each mining pool desires to make a profit in the competition against others. To this end, an intelligent mining strategy to enable a mining pool to attain higher probability to get rewards disproportional to its computational power is proposed in this paper. We deploy some forwarding nodes according to the distribution of Bitcoin nodes. This strategy can reduce time delay for messages propagation and increase the probability for new block to be appended on the longest blockchain. It is also easy to deploy in existing network with low expenditure.

AB Trust Management (TM) systems for authentication are vital to the security of online interactions, which are ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Various systems, like the Web PKI (X.509) and PGP's Web of Trust are used to manage trust in this setting. In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.
   In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.

AB Bitcoin is decentralized cryptocurrency which has recently become increasingly popular all over the world. Blockchain works as a public ledger to record all transactions in Bitcoin system. A transaction to transfer bitcoins includes a set of inputs and outputs, with its unique hash value. However, the owners of transferred bitcoins can only sign on the transaction to provide integrity for its content without guarantee for its output script. This is considered as transaction malleability in Bitcoin system, which allows an attacker to intercept, modify, and rebroadcast a transaction into the Bitcoin network. This attack deceives the transaction issuer into believing that the original transaction failed to be recorded in blockchain. The vulnerability has been utilized by attackers leading a bankruptcy of the largest Bitcoin exchange at that time. To avoid this situation happens again, we present an efficient strategy to secure user wallet in this paper. Our scheme confirms success of a transaction not only relying on its unique hash value, but also relying on the address balance it spends. This strategy doesn't add too much complexity and is easy to implement in existing wallets. It is resistant to transaction malleability and helps Bitcoin users to protect their property from malicious entities.

AB With the accelerated iteration of technological innovation, blockchain has rapidly become one of the hottest Internet technologies in recent years. As a decentralized and distributed data management solution, blockchain has restored the definition of trust by the embedded cryptography and consensus mechanism, thus providing security, anonymity and data integrity without the need of any third party. But there still exists some technical challenges and limitations in blockchain. This paper has conducted a systematic research on current blockchain application in cybersecurity. In order to solve the security issues, the paper analyzes the advantages that blockchain has brought to cybersecurity and summarizes current research and application of blockchain in cybersecurity related areas. Through in-depth analysis and summary of the existing work, the paper summarizes four major security issues of blockchain and performs a more granular analysis of each problem.
   Adopting an attribute-based encryption method, the paper also puts forward an enhanced access control strategy

AB Blockchain is a new type of decentralized technology, causing more and more attention because of the huge number of implicit revolutionary applications in many fields, especially in the finance field. The DAO was a crowdfunding project based on blockchain. It was one of the most widely-known blockchain applications in 2016, not only because of the most amount of crowdfunded money (i.e., ETH tokens) so far, in a very short period, but also due to the attack event. In this paper, a brief introduction of The DAO attack event is presented. We also present an acute analysis of the result that "the hacker stole large quantity of money from The DAO", as well as the analysis of the suggested solution that "the wallet address of the hacker should be frozen" to the event given by The DAO community. Accordingly, two logical paradoxes are formulated on the event results and the proposed solution. Finally, The DAO paradoxes are formally described, analyzed, and proved in propositional logic.

AB Bitcoin's underlying blockchain database is a novel approach to recordkeeping that has the potential to decentralize big data. Bitcoin's success has inspired a multitude of spinoff projects hoping to use blockchain as a distributed database for records-management innovation in other fields. Misconceptions and exaggerations about blockchain and its capabilities are pervasive in the media. Drawing on perspectives from archival science, dependable computing, and secure computing, this paper surveys current applications, research, and critiques of blockchain to provide an objective assessment of its benefits and limitations. Based on the findings of the survey, this paper proposes three criteria that predict success for blockchain-based data management projects, briefly: dependability, security, and trust.

DE P2P File System; Blockchain; Zigzag Codes
AB IPFS [1] is a peer-to-peer version controlled filesystem that synthesizes learnings from many previous successful systems. IPFS combines a distributed Hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace [1]. IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. According to the characteristics of IPFS, we propose an improved P2P file system scheme based on IPFS and Blockchain. We address the high-throughput problem for individual users in IPFS by introducing the role of content service providers. Consider data reliability and availability, storage overhead and other issues for service providers, we provide a novel zigzag-based storage model to improve the block storage model that IPFS provides. Moreover, we introduce blockchain to combine IPFS with this storage model. According to analysis, this proposed scheme can effectively solve the above problems.

AB Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency, is often involved in illicit activities such as scamming, ransomware attacks, illegal goods trading, and thievery. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin ecosystem has not yet been mapped and as such there is no estimate of the share of illicit activities. This paper provides the first estimation of the portion of cyber-criminal entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our dataset consists of 854 observations categorised into 12 classes (out of which 5 are cybercrime-related) and a total of 100,000 uncategorised observations. The dataset was obtained from the data provider who applied three types of clustering of Bitcoin transactions to categorise entities: co-spend, intelligence-based, and behaviour-based. Thirteen supervised learning classifiers were then tested, of which four prevailed with a cross-validation accuracy of 77.38%, 76.47%, 78.46%, 80.76% respectively. From the top four classifiers, Bagging and Gradient Boosting classifiers were selected based on their weighted average and per class precision on the cybercrime-related categories. Both models were used to classify 100,000 uncategorised entities, showing that the share of cybercrime-related is 29.81% according to Bagging, and 10.95% according to Gradient Boosting with number of entities as the metric. With regard to the number of addresses and current coins held by this type of entities, the results are: 5.79% and 10.02% according to Bagging; and 3.16% and 1.45% according to Gradient Boosting.

AB This paper introduces some of the interdependent components within the multifaceted solution our team is developing towards accelerating the functionality, complexity and versatility of blockchain-enabled services. The focus here is particularly on introducing and bringing together selected individual components of the solution to achieve a synergistic effect in expanding the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions of this paper include: (i) proposing a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) proposing a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) proposing a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security, and applying this method both in the context of method (i) and method (ii); and (iv) proposing the use of distributed hash tables DHT in building secure and optimized repositories in the context of method (i) and in the context method (ii), where the former involves a DHT repository of smart contracts and the latter involves a DHT repository of entities underlying smart contracts that are being exchanged among different smart contracts and subcontracts. The smart-contract focused methods introduced in this paper contribute to the overall goal towards a sustainable adaptive mechanism for processing evolving volumes, versatility, and complexity of blockchain transactions, traffic, and services. Blockchain-enabled services are efficient, secure, automated, and allowing worldwide distribution of resources. They present a more efficient and sustainable alternative to current service infrastructures within a range of domains, particularly the legal and financial domains. They also set a sustainable infrastructure for emerging Internet-of-things services.

AB With the advent of numerous online content providers, utilities and applications, each with their own specific version of privacy policies and its associated overhead, it is becoming increasingly difficult for concerned users to manage and track the confidential information that they share with the providers. We have developed a novel framework to automatically track details about how a user's PII is stored, used and shared by the provider. We have integrated our data privacy ontology with the properties of blockchain, to develop an automated access-control and audit mechanism that enforces users' data privacy policies when sharing their data across third parties. We have also validated this framework by implementing a working system LinkShare. In this paper, we describe our framework on detail along with the LinkShare system. Our approach can be adopted by big data users to automatically apply their privacy policy on data operations and track the flow of that data across various stakeholders.

AB Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the market at this time. A crypto currency is a kind of currency which has no physical form, but rather only works over the internet. This also means that there are a lot of vulnerabilities in this form of money transaction. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of these issues as well as suggest ways in which we can keep bitcoin secure.

AB Blockchain is an emerging backbone technology behind different crypto-currencies. It can also be used for other purposes and areas. There are different scalability issues associated with blockchain. It is important to know the in depth structure of blockchain by identifying common behaviors of the transactions and the effect of these behaviors on the nodes of the network. Dominant set approach can categorize the blockchain transactions into different clusters without mentioning number of clusters in advance. The experimental evaluation of blockchain transactions shows better clustering accuracy of dominant set approach than existing method of central clustering approach.

ID EMISSIONS
AB With the development of digital technologies, especially big data analytics, digital innovations are taking root in various industries, including energy sector. Particularly, urban energy system is also experiencing digital transition; such digital transition not only offers new business models commercially, but also brings new research problems scientifically. The new capabilities enabled by these digital technologies are reshaping the generation, transmission, consumption and storage sections in the urban energy system, sequentially the traditional way of how urban energy system is designed and operated should be reexamined. Starting from here, there have been many studies regarding how various digital technologies can be applied all along the urban energy system value chain; these studies range from individuals' energy consumption pattern characterization by using customer behavior data in smart home, to complex data-driven planning of regional scale energy system. More specifically, numerous computational models have been proposed by the scientific community to mimic the dynamics of various components at various levels in the urban energy system. However, the potential benefits of applying these numerical models are somehow underestimated; we believe there are still several gaps from numerical modeling to computational intelligence which need to be bridged. In such a context, in this paper we strive to present a systematic review on the status of urban energy system related digital innovations as well as prospective outlook on the future application of such digital technologies. Through the study of this paper, we hope to identify several key points where digitalization should be prioritized in urban energy system, picture a roadmap towards future digital technology enabled intelligent urban energy system, and finally points out the research gaps that need to be fulfilled over there.

DE social manufacturing network; socialized manufacturing resources;
   production credit mechanism; decentralized network; blockchain
AB Increasing production personalization demand requires manufacturing enterprises to gain higher flexibility and faster market response. Enterprises have to share their manufacturing resources and cooperate with each other to win out in the fierce market competition. Under the circumstances, Social Manufacturing (SocialM) mode is proposed. In this mode, Social Manufacturing Network (SMN) integrates distributed Socialized Manufacturing Resources (SMRs) to provide more precise and professional service for customers. As a decentralized network, SMN cannot ensure the cross-enterprise collaborations because there is no trusted third party as supervisor. In this paper, a blockchain-based Production Credit Mechanism (PCM) for manufacturing services is put forward to regulate the cross-enterprise collaborations among SMRs. The frame and concept of PCM are firstly given followed by four key enabling technologies supporting the implementation of the mechanism. It is expected that the PCM proposed in this paper will provide a possible way to normalize and regulate cross-enterprise collaborations under social manufacturing mode.

ID ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD; MANAGEMENT
AB We present an architecture for peer-to-peer energy markets which can guarantee that operational constraints are respected and payments are fairly rendered, without relying on a centralized utility or microgrid aggregator. We demonstrate how to address trust, security, and transparency issues by using blockchains and smart contracts, two emerging technologies which can facilitate decentralized coordination between nontrusting agents. While blockchains are receiving considerable interest as a platform for distributed computation and data management, this is the first work to examine their use to facilitate distributed optimization and control. Using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we pose a decentralized optimal power flow (OPF) model for scheduling a mix of batteries, shapable loads, and deferrable loads on an electricity distribution network. The DERs perform local optimization steps, and a smart contract on the blockchain serves as the ADMM coordinator, allowing the validity and optimality of the solution to be verified. The optimal schedule is securely stored on the blockchain, and payments can be automatically, securely, and trustlessly rendered without requiring a microgrid operator.

AB One of the major concerns on today's Software Defined Network (SDN) is to enhance its security. Files sharing in SDN can be made much more secured against fraudulent activities by the implementation of blockchain technology. When the privacy of network's users is increased, the reliability of system increases correspondingly. Blockchain Security over SDN (BSS) is proposed which protects privacy and availability of resources against non-trusting members.
   Mininet emulator is used for simulating custom SDN network topology. OpenDaylight controller is integrated with OpenStack controller. For cloud data storage, OpenStack platform is used. For testing purpose of Blockchain, Pyethereum tester tool under Ethereum platform is implemented. Serpent programming is used for creating contract in the blockchain. BSS facilitates files sharing among SDN users in distributed peer-to-peer basis using OpenStack as a cloud storage platform.

AB Due to the sustained and rapid growth of information and communication technology (ICT) and automation techniques, smart factories for high-end equipment manufacturing involve extensive collaborative networks and knowledge sets. Conventional manufacturing modes are undergoing profound reforms in the Internet and Big Data era, and operations management of such factories should lay more emphasis on service values. To this end, the current manufacturing modes and operations management strategies are fully investigated in this paper. A CPSS (cyber-physical-social system)-based manufacturing mode of smart factories for high-end equipment manufacturing is put forward. The connotation of operations management of smart factory is extended based on the introduction of service value and value chain, thus contributing to a win-win situation of an enterprise and its customers. Furthermore, a multi-participation Blockchain-based collaborative manufacturing model for smart factories is presented.

AB Blockchain is the basic technology of bitcoin. With the value appreciation and stable operation of bitcoin, blockchain is attracting more and more attention in many areas. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, stability, security, and non-modifiability. It has the potential to change the network architecture. The consensus algorithm plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and efficiency of blockchain. Using a right algorithm may bring a significant increase to the performance of blockchain application. In this paper, we reviewed the basic principles and characteristics of the consensus algorithms and analyzed the performance and application scenarios of different consensus mechanisms. We also gave a technical guidance of selecting a suitable consensus algorithm and summarized the limitations and future development of blockchain technology.

AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are operated by a handful of mining pools. Nearly 95% of Bit coin's and 80% of Ethereum's mining power resides with less than ten and six mining pools respectively. Although miners benefit from low payout variance in pooled mining, centralized mining pools require members to trust that pool operators will remunerate them fairly. Furthermore, centralized pools pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up possibilities for collusion between pools for perpetrating severe attacks.
   In this work, we propose SMARTPOOL, a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. Our protocol shows how one can leverage smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining SMARTPOOL gives transaction selection control back to miners while yielding low variance payouts. SMARTPOOL incurs mining fees lower than centralized mining pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SMARTPOOL implementation on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. To date, our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, costing miners a mere 0.6% of block rewards in transaction fees.

AB Blockchains show promise as potential infrastructure for financial transaction systems. The security of blockchains today, however, relies critically on Proof-of Work (PoW), which forces participants to waste computational resources.
   We present REM (Resource-Efficient Mining), a new blockchain mining framework that uses trusted hardware (Intel SGX). REM achieves security guarantees similar to PoW, but leverages the partially decentralized trust model inherent in SGX to achieve a fraction of the waste of PoW. Its key idea, Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW), involves miners providing trustworthy reporting on CPU cycles they devote to inherently useful workloads. REM flexibly allows any entity to create a useful workload. REM ensures the trustworthiness of these workloads by means of a novel scheme of hierarchical attestations that may be of independent interest.
   To address the risk of compromised SGX CPUs, we develop a statistics-based formal security framework, also relevant to other trusted-hardware-based approaches such as Intel's Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). We show through economic analysis that REM achieves less waste than PoET and variant schemes.
   We implement REM and, as an example application, swap it into the consensus layer of Bitcoin core. The result is the first full implementation of an SGX-based blockchain We experiment with four example applications as useful workloads for our implementation of REM, and report a computational overhead of 5 - 15%.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. As a database and computational platform, blockchain has both advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional techniques. Blockchain may be an appropriate choice for some use cases while conventional technologies will be more appropriate for other use cases. A major difficulty for practitioners to decide whether or not to use blockchain is that limited product data or reliable technology evaluation available to assess the suitability of blockchains. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework that comprises a list of criteria and a typical process for practitioners to assess the suitability of applying blockchain using these criteria based on the characteristics of the use cases. We then use several existing industrial trails to evaluate the feasibility of our framework

AB A Blockchain is basically a decentralized, distributed ledger of all the transactions or events which takes place only after involving multiple parties. It ensures high level of security as the transactions which takes place are entirely anonymous. Each transactions or digital events taking place in a Blockchain network is verified, only if it is agreed upon by the consensus of the majority party of the users participating in this process. Blockchain is one of the emerging technologies in today's world and a lot of revolution and research has just began regarding this distributed technology. Bitcoin has been the most popular cryptographic currency since it was invented and it is the best example that uses the Blockchain technology. In this paper, we will discuss about the research being done on this new domain of Computer Science. We will outline the underlining concepts about this new technology. We will try to peek a bit into its applications in the financial and non financial sector. It is not only the most popular topic to discuss about, but is the most technological breakthrough, that is all set to revolutionize the entire world.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized currency system that does not need any central authorities. All transactions issued by users have been recorded in the common ledger, called blockchain, which is shared by all users. In Bitcoin, an SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) client, which is a lightweight client that does not possess the entire blockchain, are developed for storage constrained devices such as a mobile phone. For an SPV client to check if there are transactions related to it, a Bloom filter where their Bitcoin addresses are involved is sent to a full client that possesses the entire blockchain. The full client only transfers transactions of which Bitcoin addresses are positive on the received Bloom filter. However, it is necessary to preserve the privacy of SPV clients when designing a Bloom filter because SPV clients' Bitcoin addresses will be identified by a full client with high probability. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving Bloom filter design for SPV clients based on gamma-Deniability. gamma-Deniability is a privacy metric that shows how much true positive Bitcoin addresses are hidden by the false positives in a Bloom filter. Furthermore, in order to design a Bloom Filter that satisfies a certain gamma-Deniability, it is necessary to know the number of unique Bitcoin addresses that appear for the first time since the queried time. Based on our manual inspection, we propose to estimate it based on the linear regression. We show that our scheme achieves good estimation accuracy and gamma through the simulation with a real Bitcoin blockchain.

DE Blockchain; reputation system; vehicular networks; data credibility
AB The security of vehicular networks has been paid increasing attention to with the rapid development of automobile industry and Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing approaches mainly focus on ensuring data authentication and integrity, which are not sufficient to assess the credibility of received messages. Recently, reputation systems are proved to be effective approaches to solve the above problem. This paper proposes a new reputation system for data credibility assessment based on the blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles rate the received messages based on observations of traffic environments and pack these ratings into a "block". Each block is "chained" to the previous one by storing the hash value of the previous block. Then, a temporary center node is elected from vehicles and it is responsible for broadcasting its rating block to others. Based on ratings stored in the blockchain, vehicles are able to calculate the reputation value of the message sender and then evaluate the credibility of the message. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting, validating, and storing reputation information in vehicular networks.

AB Joint cloud computing (JointCloud), as a brand-new paradigm of cloud computing, aims at building a cloud ecosystem, in which end users are agnostic to cloud service vendors as applications and services are built upon virtual clouds. In case of low quality cloud resources provided deliberately and in order to facilitate the persistent and sound development of JointCloud ecosystem, we propose a dynamic and customized reputation system framework (DC-RSF) to evaluate the credibility of cloud service vendors. At the core of DC-RSF is the customized and dynamic credibility model (CDCM), which calculates credit value for each cloud service vendor based on service requirements of end users and credential attributes of cloud service vendors. We further incorporate a Blockchain-based module into DC-RSF to prevent the credit value from being artificially tampered.

AB With the development of Economic Globalization, traditional single-cloud providers can not meet the needs of the explosive, global, diverse cloud services. JointCloud aims at empowering the cooperation among multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSP) to provide cross-cloud services. Our work in this paper is mainly focused on the accounting technology for JointCloud computing and we propose the JCLedger - a blockchain based distributed ledger. A new participant CCP (Cryptocurrency Provider) is introduced into the JointCloud collaboration environment to provide the cryptocurrency transferred. We have a detailed description of JCLedger model. We further analyze the four most important mechanisms for JCLedger and provide basic perspectives for in-depth analysis. Finally, we discuss the innovations of JCLedger and our future work in this field.

AB Affordable and reliable supply chain visibility is becoming increasingly important as the complexity of the network underlying supply chains is becoming orders of magnitudes higher compared to a decade ago. Moreover, this increase in complexity is starting to reflect on the cost of goods and their availability to the consumers. This paper addresses two key issues in the distribution phase of the supply chain, namely, affordability and pseudo real-time visibility of truckload activities. The proposed framework creates a digital thread that tracks the pseudo real-time status of the shipment making the physical distribution process completely transparent to the stakeholders. The architecture of the framework is based on a dynamic hybrid peer-to-peer network and a private/public blockchain data model that leverages emergent sensor technologies.

DE data exchange; blockchain; ecosystem
AB In recent years, data is becoming the most valuable asset. There are more and more data exchange markets on Internet. These markets help data owners publish their datasets and data consumers find appropriate services. However, different from traditional goods like clothes and food, data is a special commodity. For current data exchange markets, it is very hard to protect copyright and privacy. Moreover, maintaining data services requires special IT techniques, which is a difficult job for many organizations who own big datasets, such as hospitals, government departments, planetariums and banks. In this paper, we propose a decentralized solution for big data exchange. This solution aims at cultivating an ecosystem, inside which all participators can cooperate to exchange data in a peer-to-peer way. The core part of this solution is to utilize blockchain technology to record transaction logs and other important documents. Unlike existing data exchange markets, our solution does not need any third-parties. It also provides an convenient way for data owners to audit the use of data, in order to protect data copyright and privacy. We will explain the ecosystem, and discuss the technical challenges and corresponding solutions.

AB Since the release of Bitcoins as crypto currency, Bitcoin has played a prominent part in the media. However, not Bitcoin but the underlying technology blockchain offers the possibility to innovatively change industries. The decentralized structure of the blockchain is particularly suitable for implementing control and business processes in microgrids, using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This paper provides a state of the art survey overview of current blockchain technology based projects with the potential to revolutionize microgrids and provides a first attempt to technically characterize different start-up approaches. The most promising use case from the microgrid perspective is peer-to-peer trading, where energy is exchanged and traded locally between consumers and prosumers. An application concept for distributed PV generation is provided in this promising area.

AB Distributed storage platforms draw much attention due to their high reliability and scalability for handling a massive amount of data. To protect user and data privacy, encryption is considered as a necessary feature for production systems like Storj. But it prohibits the nodes from performing content search. To preserve the functionality, we observe that a protocol of integration with searchable encryption and keyword search via distributed hash table allows the nodes in a network to search over encrypted and distributed data. However, this protocol does not address a practical threat in a fully distributed scenario. Malicious nodes would sabotage search results, and easily infiltrate the system as the network grows. Using primitives such as MAC and verifiable data structure may empower the users to verify the search result, but the robustness of the overall system can hardly be ensured. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a protocol that is seamlessly incorporated to encrypted search in distributed network to attest and monitor nodes. From the moment a node joins the system, it will be attested and continuously monitored through verifiable search queries. The result of each attestation is determined via a standard quorum-based voting protocol, and then recorded on the blockchain as a consensus view of trusted nodes. Based on the proposed protocols, malicious nodes can be detected and removed by a majority of nodes in a self-determining manner. To demonstrate the security and efficiency, we conduct robustness analysis against several potential attacks, and perform performance and overhead evaluation on the proposed protocol.

AB In Location Based Services (LBSs), service providers can obtain mobile users' locations or traces while receiving their service requests. K-anonymity, which is the most commonly used location privacy protection method, needs the cooperation among mobile users to form a k-anonymous group. Though several incentive mechanisms have been proposed to motivate mobile users to participate in the k-anonymous group, most of them rely on a 'trustful' center. In this paper, we propose a distributed secure incentive mechanism that applies blockchain smart contracts to motivate users for k-anonymity cooperation. To protect the reward transaction information, group encryption and blind collective signature are adopted. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism.

AB User authentication in computer systems has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. However, the existing user authentication schemes either require human cognitive ability to remember numerous complex id and password, or rely on a trusted third party which could fail due to technical failure or denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we design a fully distributed user authentication framework with the blockchain technology. In our scheme, a user stores her identity in the blockchain, stores her encrypted personal information in a off-blockchain storage, and attaches a smart contract which grants different permissions to each website/application. When a user logs in a website/application, the service provider employs a challenge-response protocol to verify the identity of the user, and then retrieve the user's personal information from the off-blockchain storage.

AB In recent years certification authorities (CAs) have been the target of multiple attacks due to their sensitive role in internet security. In fact, with access to malicious certificates it is possible to mount effective large-scale man-in-the-middle attacks that may become very vicious, especially if the incident is not properly handled. Many attacks, such as the 2011 ones against DigiNotar and Comodo, also show strong hints of state sponsorship; thus, CAs have to be considered primary targets in a scenario of (possibly state-sponsored) large-scale cyber attacks. Therefore, there is a need for a PKI protocol which is more resilient and without single points of failure, such as the CAs. The BIX protocol is a blockchain-based protocol that allows distribution of certificates linking a subject with their public key, hence providing a service similar to that of a PKI but without the need for a CA. In this paper, we analyse the security of the BIX protocol in a formal way. First, we identify formal security assumptions which are well-suited to this protocol. Second, we present some attack scenarios against the BIX protocol. Third, we provide formal security proofs that these attacks are not feasible under our previously established assumptions.

AB Cloud federation is a novel concept that has been drawing attention from research and industry. However, there is a lack of solid proposal that can be widely adopted in practice to guarantee adequate governance of federations, especially in the Public Sector contexts due to legal requirements.
   In this paper, we propose an innovative governance approach that ensures distributed and democratic control in cloud federations. Starting from FaaS, a recent cloud federation proposal, we propose a blockchain infrastructure for the federation registry that implements the proposed governance approach.

AB A Cloud federation is a collaboration of organizations sharing data hosted on their private cloud infrastructures in order to exploit a common business opportunity. However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by member organizations' concerns on sharing their data with potentially competing organizations. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose the architecture of a novel identity and access management system part of FaaS, a cloud federation service developed by the H2020 SUNFISH project. Our system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes in clear. The architecture relies on two novel technologies, blockchain and Intel SGX hardware platform to guarantee integrity of the policy evaluation process.

AB Recently, blockchains have been gathering a lot of interest. Many applications can benefit from the advantages of blockchains. Nevertheless, applications with more restricted privacy or participation requirements cannot rely on public blockchains. First, the whole blockchain can be downloaded at any time, thus making the data available to the public. Second, anyone can deploy a node, join the blockchain network and take part in the consensus building process. Private and consortium blockchains promise to combine the advantages of blockchains with stricter requirements on the participating entities. This is also the reason for the comparably small number of nodes that store and extend those blockchains. However, by targeting specific nodes, an attacker can influence how consensuses are reached and possibly even halt the blockchain operation. To provide additional security to the blockchain nodes, ChainGuard utilizes SDN functionalities to filter network traffic, thus implementing a firewall for blockchain applications. ChainGuard communicates with the blockchain nodes it guards to determine which origin of the traffic is legitimate. Packets from illegitimate sources are intercepted and thus cannot have an effect on the blockchain. As is shown with experiments, ChainGuard provides access control functionality and can effectively mitigate flooding attacks from several sources at once.

AB Blockchain has recently attracted tremendous interest due to its ability to enhance security and privacy through a immutable shared distributed ledger. Blockchain's ability to detect integrity violations are particularly key in providing assured data provenance in cloud platform. The practical adoption of blockchain will largely hinge on consensus protocols meeting performance and security guarantees. In this paper, we present the design issues for consensus protocols for blockchain based cloud provenance. We present the blockchain based data provenance framework for cloud. We find that there are performance and security challenges in adopting proof-of-work consensus protocol within this framework. We present unique design challenges and opportunities in developing proof-of-stake for data provenance in cloud platform.

AB 5G Network Slice Broker concept aims to enable mobile virtual network operators, over-the-top providers, and industry vertical market players to request and lease resources from infrastructure providers dynamically according to needs. In the future digital factory, the leasing of resources could also happen autonomously by manufacturing equipment. This paper presents Blockchain Slice Leasing Ledger Concept and analysis of its applicability in the Factory of the Future. The novel concept utilizes 5G Network Slice Broker in a Blockchain to reduce service creation time and enable manufacturing equipment autonomously and dynamically acquire the slice needed for more efficient operations.

AB The IoT presents opportunities in all industrial sectors and is integral to the future of goods and services. The IoT includes the old Internet, but is substantially different from the old Internet for at least one very simple reason: the devices at the periphery of the network are not operated by people. These devices may be semi-or fully automated. And they will vastly outnumber the human operated devices in a short period of time. Blockchain is the basis technology for crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. But Blockchain can have far larger applications in the IoT, because Blockchain is highly distributed and publically viewable system of sequentially linked cryptographically. This in turn means that the Blockchain can be used to build trusted connections without an intermediary. This paper presents a concept of application.

AB Blockchain technology is rising towards the peak of inflated expectations according to Gartner's 2016 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. A public ledger that enables low cost, near real-time, secure and time stamped transactions in a peer-to-peer network of participants without the need for a trusted third party offers great potentials for networks of cooperating companies of the manufacturing industry.
   Therefore, in this paper presents a definition and recent developments of the blockchain technology as well as evaluates existing applications with respect to the suitability for manufacturing companies. Furthermore, requirements for implementation of applications in manufacturing SMEs are derived to support the advancing digitization of industries.

AB Smart Cities depend on data from numerous different sources to live up to their full potential. Adding personal data from private sources to a smart city's resources significantly increases this potential. Sustainable utilisation of such data must base on legal compliancy, ethical soundness, and consent of the providing data subjects. They have to be assured that their personal data will not be used for anything beyond the scope they agreed to, and that it will not suffer from any additional risk exposure. For this we propose a solution for self-determined data subjects (SDDS), which keeps the private and personal data at their decentralized, safe locations, without depriving the smart city from the information contained within. SDDS achieves this with strict compartmentalization of its different system elements, by exclusively storing non-mnemonic indices and IDs in a public ledger, and by sending mere analytical results, yet no original data across the network. Such a setup ensures the data subjects' privacy, grants the smart city access to a high number of new data sources, and simultaneously handles the user-consent to ensure compliance with data protection laws.

AB In recent years, volunteer service in China has made an unprecedented development, but the credibility and traceability of volunteer service time management are confronted with serious challenges. Since traditional time record systems cannot protect the related data security of the volunteers. In this paper, we study the volunteer time record system based on the blockchain technology which is the core technology of bitcoin, unlike bitcoin transaction in our system are not strictly financial they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying, and sharing data. Volunteer service time and activity information recorded by sending the chain transaction. Effective time recognition is guaranteed by smart contract. It can ensure that the volunteer's time is independent of improper human interference, and the fairness of volunteer service, realizes the traceability and transparency of the entire time record process. Then we describe a specific case and use the system we proposed storing the volunteer service time, volunteers' service time can be certified effectively.

AB Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data structure named the blockchain which is maintained by a community of participants.
   The Bitcoin Core protocol limits blocks to 1 MB in size. Each block contains at most some 4,000 transactions. Blocks are added to the blockchain on average every 10 minutes, therefore the transaction rate is limited to some 7 transactions per second (TPS). This is much less than the transaction rate offered by competing financial transaction processing systems.
   The Bitcoin TPS can be increased by increasing the block size and/or by decreasing the block discovery interval. Both of these interventions will increase the end-to-end block transmission delay, which in turn will increase the probability that different participants momentarily record different versions of the blockchain, so that the consensus protocol will discard an increasing number of blocks. The net effect is that the real increase in the TPS is not proportional to the increase (decrease) in the block size (block discovery rate).
   Our simulation experiments show that large block sizes, if accompanied by large end-to-end block transmission delays, give rise to the frequent appearance of inconsistent blockchain copies, to the detriment of the TPS. We present a simulation analysis of Bitcoin-Next Generation where blocks (keyblocks) stripped of transactions propagate rapidly through the peer-to-peer network. Once a keyblock is mined, only the miner of the keyblock is entitled to broadcast small microblocks of transactions until the next keyblock is mined and another miner is selected to broadcast microblocks. Initial simulation experiments show that Bitcoin-NG can sustain substantially larger transaction rates than Bitcoin Core.

AB With the successful deployment of wireless networks such as cellular and Wi-Fi networks as well as development of lightweight hand-held devices, wireless communication became the fastest growing sector in communication industry and wireless networks have been part of every business. Over 25 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Because of exponentially increasing number of connected devices, we have Internet of Things (IoT) enabled applications that offer socioeconomic benefits. Different IoT applications have different operational requirements and constraints. For instance, IoT enabled transportation cyber-physical system needs lowest latency and high data rate, IoT enabled financial systems or banks need high security to support mobile banking, IoT enabled manufacturing systems need high resiliency to combat fault tolerance and cyber-attacks, IoT enabled cyber-physical power system needs the least latency and highest resiliency to avoid power outage caused by faults or cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose wireless network virtualization to create different virtual wireless networks (VWNs) through mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to support different IoT enabled systems with diverse requirements and resiliency. Wireless virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization, provide better coverage, increase network capacity, enhance energy efficiency and provide security. In order to prevent double-spending (allocating same frequency to multiple network providers) of wireless resources, we have proposed to use blockchain based approach which provides quality-of-service to users. Furthermore, IoT is expected to generate massive amount of data (aka big data), we consider edge computing to process big data when individual devices have limited computing/processing and storage capabilities. Moreover, network segmentation through VWNs provides the security and enhances the network performance. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from simulation.

AB Among the smart cities applications, optimizing lottery games is one of the urgent needs to ensure their fairness and transparency. The emerging blockchain technology shows a glimpse of solutions to fairness and transparency issues faced by lottery industries. This paper presents the design of a blockchain-based lottery system for smart cities applications. We adopt the smart contracts of blockchain technology and the cryptograph blockchain model, Hawk [8], to design the blockchain-based lottery system, FairLotto, for future smart cities applications. Fairness, transparency, and privacy of the proposed blockchain-based lottery system are discussed and ensured.

AB When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2008 by an enigmatic programmer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it was billed as the world's first decentralized virtual currency. Offering the first credible incarnation of a digital currency, Bitcoin was based on the principal of peer to peer transactions involving a complex public address and a private key that only the owner of the coin would know. This paper will seek to investigate how the usage and value of Bitcoin is affected by current events in the cyber environment. Is an advancement in the digital security of Bitcoin reflected by the value of the currency and conversely does a major security breech have a negative effect? By analyzing statistical data of the market value of Bitcoin at specific points where the currency has fluctuated dramatically, it is believed that trends can be found. This paper proposes that based on the data analyzed, the current integrity of the Bitcoin security is trusted by general users and the value and usage of the currency is growing. All the major fluctuations of the currency can be linked to significant events within the digital security environment however these fluctuations are beginning to decrease in frequency and severity. Bitcoin is still a volatile currency but this paper concludes that this is a result of security flaws in Bitcoin services as opposed to the Bitcoin protocol itself.

AB In this paper, we present ethnographic data that unpacks the everyday work of some of the many infrastructuring agents who contribute to creating, sustaining and growing the Blockchain information infrastructure. We argue that this infrastructuring work takes the form of entrepreneurial actions, which are self-initiated and primarily directed at sustaining or increasing the initiator's stake in the emerging information infrastructure. These entrepreneurial actions wrestle against the affordances of the installed base of the Blockchain infrastructure, and take the shape of engaging or circumventing activities. These activities purposefully aim at either influencing or working around the enablers and constraints afforded by the Blockchain information infrastructure, as its installed base is gaining inertia. This study contributes to our understanding of the purpose of infrastructuring, seen from the perspective of heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents. It supplements existing accounts of the "when" and "how" of infrastructure, with a lens for examining the "why" of infrastructure.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency which has received increasing interest over the last five years. Built upon a decentralized peer to peer system, it supports transparent, fast, cost effective, and irreversible transactions, without the need for trusting third party financial institutions. We know however little about people's motivation and experience with bitcoin currency. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin users in Malaysia about their experience and trust challenges. Findings show that bitcoins are used more as store of value for speculative investment or savings' protection. The paper advances the HCI theories on trust by identifying main bitcoin characteristics and their impact on trust, such as decentralization, unregulation, embedded expertise, and reputation, as well as transactions' transparency, low cost, and easiness to complete. We discuss insecure transactions, the risk of dishonest traders and its mitigating strategies. The paper concludes with design implications including support for the transparency of two-way transactions, tools for materializing trust, and tools for supporting reversible transactions.

AB The Internet of Things technology has been widely used in the quality tracking of agricultural products, however, the safety of storage for tracked data is still a serious challenge. Recently, with the expansion of blockchain technology applied in cross-industry field, the unchangeable features of its stored data provide us new vision about ensuring the storage safety for tracked data. Unfortunately, when the blockchain technology is directly applied in agricultural products tracking and data storage, it is difficult to automate storage and obtain the hash data stored in the blockchain in batches base on the identity. Addressing this issue, we propose a double-chain storage structure, and design a secured data storage scheme for tracking agricultural products based on blockchain. Specifically, the chained data structure is utilized to store the blockchain transaction hash, and together with the chain of the blockchain to form a double-chain storage, which ensures the data of agricultural products will not be maliciously tampered or destructed. Finally, in the practical application system, we verify the correctness and security of the proposed storage scheme.

AB The rise of big data age in the Internet has led to the explosive growth of data size. However, trust issue has become the biggest problem of big data, leading to the difficulty in data safe circulation and industry development. The blockchain technology provides a new solution to this problem by combining non-tampering, traceable features with smart contracts that automatically execute default instructions. In this paper, we present a credible big data sharing model based on blockchain technology and smart contract to ensure the safe circulation of data resources.

AB Blockchain's ever increasing size has become a major problem. Bitcoin [7], for example, has grown to 115120 MB as of May 2017, which is roughly 115 GB. This uncontrollable growth of the Blockchain is bound to become an issue in the future, as hard disks may become too small to store the entire Blockchain history and traversing the transactions databases may become increasingly slow. Already, there are lightweight clients in various Blockchain platforms (Bitcoin included), who do not store the entire chain locally but rely on a third party to send them the blocks they need. There are many issues with these clients, mainly security problems, since they go back to trusting a central authority rather than gaining trust from several distributed peers. These clients' knowledge of the Blockchain is solely based on some third party that should be trusted, while the conceptual base for Blockchain is trust distributing.
   In this paper we present two Blockchain abbreviation schemes. The first one is based on the Ethereum [8] project and proposes replacing the full Blockchain with a new Genesis block, which summarizes everyone's account balances at a certain point in time. One possible benefit is to use less communication while still storing the prefix of the old Blockchain (or signature of the Blockchain that can validate a version archived by other participants) in a local archive. Here we trade loss of transaction history for efficiency. Our second contribution is a UNIX based architecture using the file system, for implementing Blockchain. We demonstrate a Blockchain abbreviation technique for this architecture too.

AB Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are recently gaining wide adoption since the introduction of Bitcoin, being distributed, authority-free, and secure. Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless", and the used intensive computations are considered "waste" of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something" alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work" remained far from being really "useful". In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational" solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.

AB Recent years have witnessed the trend of increasingly relying on distributed infrastructures. This increased the number of reported incidents of security breaches compromising users' privacy, where third parties massively collect, process and manage users' personal data. Towards these security and privacy challenges, we combine hierarchical identity based cryptographic mechanisms with emerging blockchain infrastructures and propose a blockchain-based data usage auditing architecture ensuring availability and accountability in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our approach relies on the use of auditable contracts deployed in blockchain infrastructures. Thus, it offers transparent and controlled data access, sharing and processing, so that unauthorized users or untrusted servers cannot process data without client's authorization. Moreover, based on cryptographic mechanisms, our solution preserves privacy of data owners and ensures secrecy for shared data with multiple service providers. It also provides auditing authorities with tamper-proof evidences for data usage compliance.

ID WILLINGNESS
AB In light of digitalization, customers increasingly share private data through their online behaviors and actions. Yet, customers have become reluctant to share data due to privacy concerns. From a psychological perspective, a reduction of users' perceived risks should result in a higher willingness to share sensitive data. The development of blockchain-supported, multi-part computation thereby represents an interesting novel empirical context to study such willingness to disclose personal data, as such technologies involve a privacy-preserving approach that could not only technically solve privacy issues but also ought to address precisely the user's risk perception. Therefore, we conducted an online experiment with 420 participants to examine the willingness to disclose personal data dependent on different privacy protection mechanisms. A deception based experiment allowed to measure not only user intention, but also real user behavior. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that participants shared similar amounts of personal data for blockchain-supported approaches and standard privacy policies. Even though an aversion to the blockchain system due to its novelty and potentially perceived complexity was not detected. Furthermore, we found that the willingness to share data increased significantly specifically for technically affine people when they were presented with the opportunity to monetize their data. We further discuss the effects of privacy awareness and whether prior knowledge of blockchain technology had a supporting effect for user acceptance.

AB Nowadays, in this digital world, one of the biggest concerns for business and many other public entities, is to know precisely the "identity" of the users that are behind of their systems. Since the data can define a person, there have been many tries to develop technology to determine accurately who the users are and certify their basics attributes like name, address, credit record, as well as other personal characteristics like health status, hobbies and others. That is why Digital Identity has taken a significantly important role in this area and becoming as a crucial security measure in this interconnected environment.
   This research is a systematic mapping review with the goal of collecting all relevant existing research of Digital Identity on Blockchain technology implemented in a smart city environment. The objective of this paper is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions of these areas from the technical point of view. It is expected that this paper can stimulate interest in theory and practice to further discussions and research in these areas.

AB Blockchain may help solve several complex problems related to securing the integrity and trustworthiness of rapid, distributed, complex energy transactions and data exchanges. In a move towards grid resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions. This may help reduce transactive energy costs and increase the security and sustainability of distributed energy resource (DER) integration, helping to remove barriers to a more decentralized and resilient power grid. This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts to improve smart grid cyber resiliency and secure transactive energy applications.

AB The blockchain technology has emerged as an attractive solution to address performance and security issues in distributed systems. Blockchain's public and distributed peer-to-peer ledger capability benefits cloud computing services which require functions such as, assured data provenance, auditing, management of digital assets, and distributed consensus. Blockchain's underlying consensus mechanism allows to build a tamper-proof environment, where transactions on any digital assets are verified by set of authentic participants or miners. With use of strong cryptographic methods, blocks of transactions are chained together to enable immutability on the records. However, achieving consensus demands computational power from the miners in exchange of handsome reward. Therefore, greedy miners always try to exploit the system by augmenting their mining power. In this paper, we first discuss blockchain's capability in providing assured data provenance in cloud and present vulnerabilities in blockchain cloud. We model the block withholding (BWH) attack in a blockchain cloud considering distinct pool reward mechanisms. BWH attack provides rogue miner ample resources in the blockchain cloud for disrupting honest miners' mining efforts, which was verified through simulations.

AB Cloud data provenance is metadata that records the history of the creation and operations performed on a cloud data object. Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.

AB Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in various domains, which are home, agricultural, healthcare, tourism, transportation and education. The more of its development, the more we need to consider about its security and privacy issues. In this paper, we consider smart home system (SHS) as a case study. SHS is an integration of home appliances together with sensors to get automatic operations of heating, lighting, air conditioning, home security, health care systems, etc. Moreover, SHS allows homeowner to monitor and perform appliances functions remotely at any instant time via the Internet. Due to the widespread availability and proliferation of the SHS, attackers can impersonate as a homeowner to steal important data (e.g., vital signs) for doing extortion and life threatening. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach of private Blockchain implementation for SHS to cope of its privacy and security issues. We review Ethereum Blockchain packages for SHS according to its smart contract features for handling access control policy, data storage and data flow management.

AB The diversity of energy prosumer types makes it difficult to create appropriate incentive mechanisms that satisfy both prosumers and energy system operators alike. Meanwhile, European energy suppliers buy Guarantees of Origin (GoO) which allow them to sell green energy at premium prices while in reality delivering grey energy to their customers. Blockchain technology has proven itself to be a robust paying system in which users transact money without the involvement of a third party. Blockchain tokens can be used to represent a unit of energy and, just as GoOs, be submitted to the market. This paper focuses on simulating marketplace using the Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts, where prosumers can sell tokenized GoOs to consumers willing to subsidize renewable energy producers. Such markets bypass energy providers by allowing consumers to obtain tokenized GoOs directly from the producers, which in turn benefit directly from the earnings. Two market strategies where tokens are sold as GoOs have been simulated. In the Fix Price Strategy prosumers sell their tokens to the average GoO price of 2014. The Variable Price Strategy focuses on selling tokens at a price range defined by the difference between grey and green energy. The study finds that the Ethereum Blockchain is robust enough to functions as a platform for tokenized GoO trading. Simulation results have been compared and the results indicate that prosumers earn significantly more money by following the Variable Price Strategy.

AB Ubiquitous learning environments have an increasing trend considering the huge number of connected smart devices dedicated to educational services. Ubiquitous learning (U-learning) provides to students the possibility to learn at anyplace and anytime within the collaborative environment using interactive multimedia system that enables effective communication among teacher and learners. The architecture of ubiquitous learning environment (ULE) still suffers from the problems of vulnerability. Blockchain (BC) technology recently explored to provide much more privacy and security using essentially peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has a significant role in the development of decentralized topologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for ULE that preserves the benefits of security and privacy. The architecture offers new opportunities to design secured collaborative learning system. It provides data exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology. The evaluation of this implemented system demonstrates its efficiency while it delivers security and privacy for ULE.

AB Current networking integrates common "Things" to the Web, creating the Internet of Things (IoT). The considerable number of heterogeneous Things that can be part of an IoT network demands an efficient management of resources. With the advent of Fog computing, some IoT management tasks can be distributed toward the edge of the constrained networks, closer to physical devices. Blockchain protocols hosted on Fog networks can handle IoT management tasks such as communication, storage, and authentication. This research goes beyond the current definition of Things and presents the Internet of "Smart Things." Smart Things are provisioned with Artificial Intelligence (AI) features based on CLIPS programming language to become self-inferenceable and self-monitorable. This work uses the permission-based blockchain protocol Multichain to communicate many Smart Things by reading and writing blocks of information. This paper evaluates Smart Things deployed on Edison Arduino boards. Also, this work evaluates Multichain hosted on a Fog network.

AB As the number of Web APIs is rapidly increasing, it is an urgent issue to discover qualified Web APIs and provide value-added services by orchestrating them. However, most of the interface descriptions of Web APIs are informal, and the Web API SLA contracts, which are a key to quality of services orchestration, require manual operations at the consumers. Meanwhile, applying the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology, to various domains beyond Fintech is attracting attention because of its fault-tolerant and anti-tampering. However, it isn't applied to Web API SLA contracts, yet. In this article, the authors propose a formal specification description of Web APIs together with its associated SLA specifications based on RDF, and an SLA contract method based on the common SLA contract platform built on the blockchain. We implemented the prototype of the SLA contract platform, and applied it to the examples for demonstrating its feasibility. Those experiences prove the feasibility of the proposed Web API SLA contract method and its supporting platform.

AB It is a challenge to ensure data integrity for cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications because of the inherently dynamic nature of IoT data. The available frameworks of data integrity verification with public auditability cannot avoid the Third Party Auditors (TPAs). However, in a dynamic environment, such as the IoT, the reliability of the TPA-based frameworks is far from being satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for Data Integrity Service. Under such framework, a more reliable data integrity verification can be provided for both the Data Owners and the Data Consumers, without relying on any Third Party Auditor (TPA). In this paper, the relevant protocols and a subsequent prototype system, which is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals, are presented. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype system is conducted, and the test results are discussed. The work lays a foundation for our future work on dynamic data integrity verification in a fully decentralized environment.

AB To achieve privacy requirements, IoT application providers may need to spend a lot of money to replace existing IoT devices. To address this problem, this study proposes the Blockchain Connected Gateways (BC Gateways) to protect users from providing personal data to IoT devices without user consent. In addition, the gateways store user privacy preferences on IoT devices in the blockchain network. Therefore, this study can utilize the blockchain technology to resolve the disputes of privacy issues. In conclusion, this paper can contribute to improving user privacy and trust in IoT applications with legacy IoT devices.

AB Bitcoin, one major virtual currency, attracts users' attention by its novel mode in recent years. With blockchain as its basic technique, Bitcoin possesses strong security features which anonymizes user's identity to protect their private information. However, some criminals utilize Bitcoin to do several illegal activities bringing in great security threat to the society. Therefore, it is necessary to get knowledge of the current trend of Bitcoin and make effort to de-anonymize. In this paper, we put forward and realize a system to analyze Bitcoin from two aspects: blockchain data and network traffic data. We resolve the blockchain data to analyze Bitcoin from the point of Bitcoin address while simulate Bitcoin P2P protocol to evaluate Bitcoin from the point of IP address. At last, with our system, we finish analyzing its current trends and tracing its transactions by putting some statistics on Bitcoin transactions and addresses, tracing the transaction flow and de-anonymizing some Bitcoin addresses to IPs.

AB The SSL protocol has been widely used for verifying digital identities and to secure Internet traffic since the early days of the web. Although X.509 certificates have been in existence for more than two decades, individual user uptake has been low due to the high cost of issuance and maintenance of such certs. This has led to a situation whereby users are able to verify the identity of an organization or e-commerce retailer via their digital certificate, but organizations have to rely on weak username and password combinations to verify the identity of customers registered with their service. We propose the X509Cloud framework which enables organizations to issue certificates to their users at zero cost, and allows them to securely store and disseminate client certificates using the Bitcoin inspired blockchain protocol. This in turn will enable organizations and individuals to authenticate and to securely communicate with other users on the Internet.

AB Data assurance and resilience are crucial security issues in cloud-based IoT applications. With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones.

AB Modern loT solutions are often an intricate system of interdependent components. Traditional monitoring techniques may not be sufficient to ensure the correct operation of those systems. We present an on-line machine learning approach for anomaly detection that is optimized for interpretability. The aim is to make it as intuitive as possible for human operators to derive insights about the system. To this end we combine characteristics of the system into sets of features that can be rendered graphically. Our solution builds on open source components and applies to any time series of numerical data. This work originated within a larger project on connected mobility that uses Blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity. Hence we demonstrate some results at the example of the public Ethereum blockchain. Further work will extend the solution to more general sensor data from the loT realm.

AB Giving people ownership of the data they produce becomes more and more important in times of ever-growing capabilities to collect and analyze data of individuals. In light of this challenge, we show how blockchain technology can enable privacy by presenting an odometer fraud prevention system. It records mileage and GPS data of cars and secures that on the blockchain, which strongly hinders odometer fraud. Our users own and control their data while at the same time data integrity is ensured. This facilitates the certification of that data. We discuss the advantages of this approach compared to current systems and also highlight limitations of our architecture and the use of blockchain technology.

AB As cities become increasingly dense, they must turn to novel technologies and frameworks to address the mobility challenges that will arise. 50% of trips in the U.S. are less than 3 miles, and could be replaced by a more sustainable and space-efficient mode of transportation, such as bicycling, if effective policies and incentives were implemented.
   This abstract presents a financial incentives system to increase the prevalence of urban cycling. The blockchainbased system allows cyclists to receive financial compensation from organizations, such as city governments or local businesses, that would like to sponsor cyclists. Using bicycle-powered sensors, cyclists collect and redeem their activity data through smart contracts stored and executed on an Ethereum blockchain. The use of blockchain technology makes transactions secure, trustworthy, and timely.
   This project envisions expanding this data platform to include additional bicycle-based sensors that cyclists use to collect and sell data, monetizing their commuting habits, and building a scalable and stable solution for encouraging sustainable transportation in cities.

AB The blockchain has fueled one of the most enthusiastic bursts of activity in applied cryptography in years, but outstanding problems in security and privacy research must be solved for blockchain technologies to go beyond the hype and reach their full potential. At the first IEEE Privacy and Security on the Blockchain Workshop (IEEE S&B), we presented peer-reviewed papers bringing together academia and industry to analyze problems ranging from deploying newer cryptographic primitives on Bitcoin to enabling use-cases like privacy-preserving file storage. We overview not only the larger problems the workshop has set out to tackle, but also outstanding unsolved issues that will require further cooperation between academia and the blockchain community.

AB Surveys indicate that users are often afraid to entrust data to cloud storage providers, because these do not offer sufficient privacy. On the other hand, peer-2-peer-based privacy-preserving storage systems like Freenet suffer from a lack of contribution and storage capacity, since there is basically no incentive to contribute own storage capacity to other participants in the network.
   We address these contradicting requirements by a design which combines a distributed storage with a privacy-preserving blockchain-based payment system to create incentives for participation while maintaining user privacy. By following a Privacy-by-Design strategy integrating privacy throughout the whole system life cycle, we show that it is possible to achieve levels of privacy comparable to state-of-the-art distributed storage technologies, despite integrating a payment mechanism.
   Our results show that it is possible to combine storage contracts and payments in a privacy-preserving way. Further, our system design may serve as an inspiration for future similar architectures.

AB Permissionless blockchain-based cryptocurrencies commonly use proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) to ensure their security, e.g. to prevent double spending attacks. However, both approaches have disadvantages: PoW leads to massive amounts of wasted electricity and re-centralization, whereas major stakeholders in PoS might be able to create a monopoly. In this work, we propose proof-of-personhood (PoP), a mechanism that binds physical entities to virtual identities in a way that enables accountability while preserving anonymity. Afterwards we introduce PoPCoin, a new cryptocurrency, whose consensus mechanism leverages PoP to eliminate the disadvantages of PoW and PoS while ensuring security. PoPCoin leads to a continuously fair and democratic wealth creation process which paves the way for an experimental basic income infrastructure.

AB Blockchain technology realizes unforgeable and decentralized ledger by applying P2P network, cryptography and consensus mechanism over distributed network. Its security relies on all of these technologies. One of fundamental problem of the security of blockchain technology is compromise of underlying cryptographic algorithms. This paper shows the impact of compromise of underlying cryptography and the way to extend the validity of blockchain applying the long-term signature scheme which was standardized in ETSI. The long-term signature scheme assume the existence of centralized PKI and secure time-stamp service. In this paper, we propose a method to apply similar concept and data structure with de-centralized manner. Our scheme avoids hard-fork of original blockchain, in the case of compromise of hash function and provides smooth-fork in the case of compromise of digital signature scheme.

AB Building the Internet of Things requires deploying a huge number of objects with full or limited connectivity to the Internet. Given that these objects are exposed to attackers and generally not secured-by-design, it is essential to be able to update them, to patch their vulnerabilities and to prevent hackers from enrolling them into botnets. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties, i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability. In this work, we investigate how the use of a blockchain infrastructure can meet these requirements, with a focus on availability. In addition, we propose a peer-to-peer mechanism, to spread updates between objects that have limited access to the Internet. Finally, we give an overview of our ongoing prototype implementation.

AB Bitcoin is the first widely adopted decentralized digital e-cash system. All Bitcoin transactions that include addresses of senders and receivers are stored in the public blockchain which could cause privacy problems. The Zerocoin protocol hides the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted third parties. However such an un-traceable remittance system could cause illegal transfers such as money laundering. In this paper we address this problem and propose an auditable decentralized e-cash scheme based on the Zerocoin protocol. Our scheme allows designated auditors to extract link information from Zerocoin transactions while preventing other users including miners from obtaining it. Respecting the mind of the decentralized system, the auditor doesn't have other authorities such as stopping transfers, confiscating funds, and deactivating accounts. A technical contribution of our scheme is that a coin sender embeds audit information with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (NIZKP). This zero-knowledge prevents malicious senders from embedding indiscriminate audit information, and we construct it simply using only the standard Schnorr protocol for discrete logarithm without zk-SNARKs or other recent techniques for zero-knowledge proof.

AB One of the fundamental applications for a practically useful system of money is remuneration. Information pertaining to the amount of compensation awarded to different individuals is often considered sensitive, commanding a certain degree of privacy. As Bitcoin and similarly designed cryptocurrencies evolve into a recognized medium of exchange for larger swaths of the world economy, an increasing number of people will earn income in the form of blockchain-based payments. The nature of these transactions is such that the minute details of an affected individuals compensation package and spending habits will be exposed to public scrutiny. In some cases this violates cultural norms which respect the confidentiality of salaries, yet in other cases it could be regarded as providing the benefits associated with greater transparency. In this work we analyse the Bitcoin blockchain record of periodic payments accruing to an individual address in exchange for goods or services rendered. For differing levels of available information we seek to determine the extent of insights that can be gleaned about the transacting counter-parties and the privacy implications this entails.

AB The innovative ideas behind blockchain offer exciting perspectives in research and development of electronic distributed ledger technologies. Bitcoin introduced an "eventual consistency" blockchain with the apparent intent of providing an open and inclusive system for secure, anonymous, yet cost-effective financial transactions based on peer-to-peer computing. It uses Proof of Work as a cryptographic puzzle to control growth of a chain and to strengthen the resiliency of a chain against subsequent rewrite attempts.
   Commercial sectors and the public sector have realized the potential of this technical approach, and we now see a number of blockchains that may be called private, closed or permissioned - and that may eschew the values inherent in the design of Bitcoin type systems. From a value-neutral research perspective, there are no clear definitions of blockchain attributes such as "private" or "permissioned", nor is there typically a good understanding of the trust assumptions that clients must make when using such services - for example in systems that do not rely on Proof of Work but on a limited and controlled set of consensus-creating agents. We believe that more research in this direction could establish firm foundations for domain-specific or coalition-specific blockchains, and that such underpinnings would offer novel trust architectures beyond those provided by completely open/public blockchains and third-party operated, closed/private blockchains.

AB In the modern world that we live in everything is gradually shifting towards a more digitized outlook. From teaching methods to online transactions, every small aspect of our life is given a more technological touch. In such a case "money" is not left behind either. An approach towards digitizing money led to the creation of "bitcoin". Bitcoin is the most efficient crypto-currency so far in the history of digital currency. Ruling out the interference of any third party which monitors the cash flow, Bitcoin is a decentralized form of online currency and is widely accepted for internet transactions all over the world. The need for digital money would be extensive in the near future.

AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) design offers many benefits over a single-master or a multi-master architecture in terms of scalability, reliability and independence. The Clondike project is being converted from a grid computing system into a universal non-dedicated P2P cluster where every participating node can benefit from its membership in the cluster. But different design requires different types of algorithms in order to guarantee the same functionality.
   One of the challenges in P2P design is a fair scheduling and a general protection of the whole cluster against abusive or malfunctioning nodes. Algorithms used in a single-master or multi-master clusters do not work anymore. We have designed a multi-level system based on one of the main principles of cryptocurrencies to achieve a distributed master-less reputation rating across the cluster.
   This paper discusses proposed cluster multi-level reputation system and its parameters. The system is evaluated on a Clondike cluster on an experimental measurement with abusive nodes involved.

AB Almost every traveller possesses some amount of leftover foreign currency, either as actual cash or on a travel currency card, at the end of any international trip. However, the means to exchange this leftover currency, coins in particular, is largely inconvenient often leading to considerable amounts discarded or left unused. In this paper, we explore how distributed ledger technology, i.e. blockchain, could be applied to the problem of utilizing this leftover foreign currency. We portray here the drawbacks of the existing systems of foreign currency exchange and delineate the requirements of a potential mobile web application for exchanging this currency by integrating smart kiosk based systems, particularly for handling cash, with a peer-to-peer currency exchange technique based on blockchain that could help to bring such currency back into circulation efficiently.

Such an efficient entity interconnection is made possible through an emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) that intends to vastly simplify policy enforcement and network reconfiguration in a dynamic manner. However, despite the obvious advantages this novel networking paradigm introduces, its increased attack surface compared to traditional networking deployments proved to be a thorny issue that creates skepticism when safety-critical applications are considered. Especially when SDN is used to support Internet-of-Things (IoT)-related networking elements, additional security concerns rise, due to the elevated vulnerability of such deployments to specific types of attacks and the necessity of inter-cloud communication any IoT application would require. The overall number of connected nodes makes the efficient monitoring of all entities a real challenge, that must be tackled to prevent system degradation and service outage. This position paper provides an overview of common security issues of SDN when linked to IoT clouds, describes the design principals of the recently introduced Blockchain paradigm and advocates the reasons that render Blockchain as a significant security factor for solutions where SDN and IoT are involved.

AB Existing data management and searching system for Internet of Things uses centralized database. For this reason, security vulnerabilities are found in this system which consists of server such as IP spoofing, single point of failure and Sybil attack This paper proposes data management system is based on blockchain which ensures security by using ECDSA digital signature and SHA-256 hash function. Location that is indicated as IP address of data owner and data name are transcribed in block which is included in the blockchain. Furthermore, we devise data manegement and searching method through analyzing block hash value. By using security properties of blockchain such as authentication, non-repudiation and data integrity, this system has advantage of security comparing to previous data management and searching system using centralized database or P2P networks.

AB IoT (Internet of Things) has a large portion of our life. This is manifested by the large number of connected devices. With the exponential growth of IoT devices, IoT security is becoming important. In particular, Smart Door Lock system is extremely important because it is closely related to the safety of the user. However, the data sent and received of existing Smart Door Lock system is vulnerable to forgery and hacking. To improve these security issues, we propose a Smart Door Lock system based on blockchain. Also, this provides data integrity and non-repudiation. Lastly, we propose an algorithm that the Smart Door Lock system judge some situations around itself and operates based on data sent from sensors.

AB Increasingly digital technology in the present helped many people lives. Unlike the electoral system, there are many conventional uses of paper in its implementation. The aspect of security and transparency is a threat from still widespread election with the conventional system (offline). General elections still use a centralized system, there is one organization that manages it. Some of the problems that can occur in traditional electoral systems is with an organization that has full control over the database and system, it is possible to tamper with the database of considerable opportunities.
   Blockchain technology is one of solutions, because it embraces a decentralized system and the entire database are owned by many users. Blockchain itself has been used in the Bitcoin system known as the decentralized Bank system. By adopting blockchain in the distribution of databases on e-voting systems can reduce one of the cheating sources of database manipulation. This research discusses the recording of voting result using blockchain algorithm from every place of election. Unlike Bitcoin with its Proof of Work, this thesis proposed a method based on a predetermined turn on the system for each node in the built of blockchain.

AB Very few ecommerce participants are observed to be satisfied with ecommerce-raised business expenses, profit sharing, fake products, or user privacy. In this article, a new ecommerce concept, i.e., Balanced Commerce, is proposed to address the concerns through innovative trading paradigms and principles. The balanced ecommerce promotes direct trades with no intermediary merchants, public and sharing resources and services, and smart broker-based business activities to assure the fairness and reduce business expenses. To implement the principles and features of the balanced ecommerce, a reference model has been developed. To identify how balanced an ecommerce system is, a balanced indicator and associated algorithms have been developed. Based on the reference model and identified features, a balanced ecommerce model, i.e., Individual - Individual (I2I), has been developed. An I2I ecommerce system is featured with an individual-oriented cloud browser to support independent trading, and a public creditworthiness cloud to provide basic and tracing data of individuals and commodities, along with smart brokering services. A number of I2I ecommerce systems have been developed and some put into practice. Three of them are described to testify the values and feasibility of the balanced ecommerce.

ID OPPORTUNISM
AB Recent quality scandals reveal the importance of quality management from a supply chain perspective. Although there has been many related studies focusing on supply chain quality management, the technologies used still have difficulties in resolving problems arising from the lack of trust in supply chains. The root reason lies in three challenges brought to the traditional centralized trust mechanism: self-interests of supply chain members, information asymmetry in production processes, costs and limitations of quality inspections. Blockchain is a promising technology to address these problems. In this paper, we discuss how to improve the supply chain quality management by adopting the blockchain technology, and propose a framework for blockchain-based supply chain quality management.

AB Used mainly for the virtual money, the Blockchain technology adopts a decentralized network of peers to ensure a secure and transparent information storage and transmission. The basic use of Blockchain can be bypassed, and it is interesting to integrate it into other fields such as the Cloud storage. Cloud storage solutions ensure a continuous data synchronization and guarantee data sharing between different users. However, sharing user side encrypted data raises key and access control management challenges. Within this paper, we propose a novel access control model called Timely CP-ABE. Two main features come with our model. First, we introduce a decentralized access control mechanism where the user legitimacy is verified by Blockchain nodes. Second, we add temporal dimension to file sharing based on CP-ABE. In fact, we introduce a validity time to the access authorization without additional revocation cost. As a proof of concept, the implementation of the Timely CP-ABE based on Blockchain is performed on the CP-ABE toolkit and Multichain solution.

AB This paper is to explore applications of the blockchain technology to the concept of "proof of X" such as proof of identity, proof of property ownership, proof of specific transaction, proof of college degree, proof of medical records, proof of academic achievements, etc. It describes a novel approach of building a decentralized transparent immutable secure personal archive management and service system. Personal archive is defined as a collection of various artifacts that reflect personal portfolio as well as personal unique identifications. Personal portfolio is beyond of a statement of personal achievement. It is an evidentiary document designed to provide qualitative and quantitative chronically documents and examples. Subjects can tag their information with proof, that is, certified by trusted entities or organizations like universities. Such proofs are associated with confidentiality levels exposed in the public domains. Personal identifications include biometrics as well as other multi-factors such as something the subject "has", the subject "knows" or the subject "acts". Stack holders in a consortium oriented blockchain network serve as verifiers and /or miners that provide their trusted services the delegated proof of stake. Such personal archive based system can be exploited to various applications including professional network like Linkedin, instant credit approval like alipay or live human from social bots like internet social media. A prototype simulation shows that such personal portfolio management and service system is feasible and immune to many ID attacks.

AB In this paper, we design a distributed platform for anonymized dataset trading without any centralized trusted third party. The platform consists of peers and consensus-based blockchain mechanism, and each peer acts as a data broker, data receiver, or verifier for blockchain in a data transfer transaction. A data broker collects data from data owners under their consent for data trading. The Privacy Policy Manager (PPM) manages the consent information and confirms them on behalf of data owners, when data distribution is requested from data broker. We implement a prototype system of the platform using an open-source blockchain mechanism, Hyperledger Fabric, and provide evaluation results of the prototype system.

AB Blockchain technology underpins a radical rethink of information privacy, confidentiality, security and integrity. As a decentralised ledger of transactions across a peer-to-peer network, the need for a central third party intermediate verification authority is disrupted. To unlock the potential for mHealth, the need for authentication and verified access to often sensitive data, specialised services and transfer of value need to be realised. This paper interrogates current processes and aims to make a case for Blockchain technology as an improved security model that has the potential to lower the cost of trust and an alternative to managing the burden of proof. This is particularly relevant for mHealth that, by its nature, is often a distributed endeavour involving the goal-orientated collaboration of a number of stakeholders.

AB The blockchain technology is gaining momentum because of its possible application to other systems than the cryptocurrency one. Indeed, blockchain, as a de-centralized system based on a distributed digital ledger, can be utilized to securely manage any kind of assets, constructing a system that is independent of any authorization entity. In this paper, we briefly present blockchain and our work in progress, the VMOA blockchain, to secure virtual machine orchestration operations for cloud computing and network functions virtualization systems. Using tutorial examples, we describe our design choices and draw implementation plans.

AB Blockchain technology is being considered as one of the ultimate revolutions that will be able to disrupt several pillars of our society. It is a public and distributed ledger built for security and interoperability. Blockchain provides all parties a secure and synchronized record of immutable transactions assembled together and permanently stored with a fingerprint, creating therefore an irreversible chain. In order to operate, this technology does not rely on any central authority. All transactions are sent over the network and the consensus is achieved by the mutual calculation and agreement. In this paper, we evaluate the blockchain technology and its evolution. Then, we characterize some essential features of the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) focusing on the three main blockchains actors: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger. Besides, we present their security challenges and explore their drawbacks that can lead to use the blockchain network in order to conduct several attack scenarios. Finally, we describe their relationship with the onion router network (Tor) that beyond the malicious uses of the blockchain via Tor, these two networks share many common points.

DE Bitcoin; Blockchain; Database; Transaction; Validation
AB In the last decade, we have seen the emergence of the Bitcoin crypto-currency, where the Blockchain technology builds trust transaction after transaction through a validation process. Academics focused their research on security flaws or improvement, but we identify a lack of literature on how the validation of transaction and block proceeds. In fact, understanding the validation will help the conception of new blockchain features and allow users to recognize all security risks. This paper aims at a deep comprehension and detailed analysis of the validation in the Bitcoin protocol.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to include billions of pervasive and mission-critical sensors and actuators connected to the (public) Internet. This network of smart devices is expected to generate and have access to vast amounts of information, creating unique opportunities for novel applications but, at the same time raising significant privacy and security concerns that impede its further adoption and development. In this paper, we explore the potential of a blockchain-assisted information distribution system for the IoT. We identify key security requirements of such a system and we discuss how they can be satisfied using blockchains and smart contracts. Furthermore, we present a preliminary design of the system and we identify enabling technologies.

AB The increasing automation and capacity of communication of industrial systems brings new possibilities and challenges to the sector. We investigate a problem of distributed and collective supply and discuss solutions to the issue of fair and reliable decision making in open systems. By combining principles of social organisation with blockchain and smart-contract technologies, we show that it is possible to develop a system for common-pool resource management able to take quick decisions on an industrial scale, while ensuring cooperation and self-organising strategies that encourage compliance. Our results demonstrate that our model - the Smart-CPR - is able to distribute resources efficiently and is capable of detecting and punishing non-compliant or unhelpful behaviour.

AB Blockchain technology has been known as a digital currency platform since the emergence of Bitcoin, the first and the largest of the cryptocurrencies. Hitherto, it is used for the decentralization of markets more generally, not exclusively for the decentralization of money and payments. The decentralized transaction ledger of blockchain could be employed to register, confirm, and send all kinds of contracts to other parties in the network. In this paper, we thoroughly review state-of-the-art blockchain-related applications emerged in the literature. A number of published works were carefully included based on their contributions to the blockchain's body of knowledge. Several remarks are explored and discussed in the last section of the paper.

   Innovations
AB Bitcoin as concept was coined in 2009 and can be described as a partly open and shared transactional database. What makes bitcoin unique is that for the first time, we can prove and move ownership of anything digital without a central authority. The technology facilitates many benefits, one being a worldwide, digital currency and we observe that some stores allow payments in bitcoin. Drawing on concepts from the Diffusion of Innovation theory we investigated: What are the end-users' motivations and barriers for using bitcoin as digital currency? Through a small survey, we collected 135 answers during the summer of 2016. Our findings include that the bitcoin users embrace bitcoin due to technological curiosity, thus an individual reason. The largest group, the non-users, state that they are awaiting for others to start using bitcoin, as they question the value and security issues. We conclude that we may witness a deadlock where "everybody waits for everybody", and that more research is needed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE decentralization; privacy; secure messaging; identity; anonymity
AB Identity systems today link users to all of their actions and serve as centralized points of control and data collection. NEXTLEAP proposes an alternative decentralized and privacy-enhanced architecture. First, NEXTLEAP is building privacy-enhanced federated identity systems, using blind signatures based on Algebraic MACs to improve OpenID Connect. Second, secure messaging applications ranging from Signal to WhatsApp may deliver the content in an encrypted form, but they do not protect the metadata of the message and they rely on centralized servers. The EC Project NEXTLEAP is focussed on fixing these two problems by decentralizing traditional identities onto a privacy-enhanced based blockchain that can then be used to build access control lists in a decentralized manner, similar to SDSI. Furthermore, we improve on secure messaging by then using this notion of decentralized identity to build in group messaging, allowing messaging between different servers. NEXTLEAP is also working with the PANORAMIX EC project to use a generic mix networking infrastructure to hide the metadata of the messages themselves and plans to add privacy-enhanced data analytics that work in a decentralized manner.

AB Micro-generation promises to greatly contribute to the energy balance of the energy grid; however, so far, its market penetration is going slow due to the few, or not-existing, direct economic benefits end-users would enjoy by deploying an in-house micro-generation system. In this paper, taking advantage of the potentialities of blockchain technologies, we propose a solar energy production and distribution architecture using smart contracts, a particular distributed ledger paradigm, to support automatic energy exchanges and auctions, potentially enabling a new, open and more fruitful, under an end-user perspective, energy micro-generation market. We present the conceptual design of the approach, as well the energy grid prototype and the control layer, running on the Ethereum platform. The proposed architecture has been implemented and validated through an in-house developed test-bed.

The methodological approach consisted on a review of relevant literature to acknowledge and deepen the "state of the art" about the topic, in addition to the implementation of an indirect, semi-structured and open-ended interview, as an heuristic procedure for the elaboration and presentation of the case study of a pioneer company in the development of these technologies, in the context of the Mexican economy: BANKCOIN. global. As a disruptive technology, the block chain has the potential for the creation of new business models that will face opportunities and challenges in and unstable context, characterized by the factors that determine the behavior and tendencies of the economy in the local, regional and global map.

ID WATERMARKING; DELIVERY
AB A distributed and tamper proof media transaction framework is proposed based on the blockchain model. Current multimedia distribution does not preserve self-retrievable information of transaction trails or content modification histories. For example, digital copies of valuable artworks, creative media and entertainment contents are distributed for various purposes including exhibitions, gallery collections or in media production workflow. Original media is often edited for creative content preparation or tampered with to fabricate false propaganda over social media. However there is no existing trusted mechanism that can easily retrieve either the transaction trails or the modification histories. We propose a novel watermarking based Multimedia Blockchain framework that can address such issues. The unique watermark information contains two pieces of information: a) a cryptographic hash that contains transaction histories (blockchain transactions log) and b) an image hash that preserves retrievable original media content. Once the watermark is extracted, first part of the watermark is passed to a distributed ledger to retrieve the historical transaction trail and the latter part is used to identify the edited / tampered regions. The paper outlines the requirements, the challenges and demonstrates the proof of this concept.

AB Cold chain logistics finance, as a new financial means, has been integrated into the development of "agriculture, farmer and rural area" and has injected new impetus into it. From the current form of financial operation of cold chain logistics, the cold chain logistics finance, influenced by many factors, such as many subjects, asymmetric information, etc., is faced with the risks of market, guarantee and operation and all kinds of risks can ultimately be attributed to the credit risk of enterprises and participating entities. It was explored to the block chain technology to prevent financial risks from the perspective of information technology on the basis of various risks. It was first analyzed to the evolution of cold chain logistics financial credit, analyzed the characteristics of block chain technology, and then cold chain logistics financial credit system framework was proposed based on the block chain technology, finally a solution was given to the credit problem based on the framework in this paper.

AB Blockchain is a decentralized, trustless protocol that combines transparency, immutability, and consensus properties to enable secure, pseudo-anonymous transactions. Smart contracts are built atop a blockchain to support on-chain storage and enable Decentralized Apps (DApps) to interact with the blockchain programatically. Programmable blockchains have generated interest in the healthcare domain as a potential solution to resolve key challenges, such as gapped communications, inefficient clinical report delivery, and fragmented health records.
   This paper provides evaluation metrics to assess blockchain-based DApps in terms of their feasibility, intended capability, and compliance in the healthcare domain.

AB The increasing trend of people moving to urban areas and the associated urbanization process require facing challenges regarding city infrastructures capability to cover citizens needs for energy, water, transportation, healthcare, education, safety. The smart urban teclmologies represent an important contribution to the sustainable development of cities, making smart cities a reality. The concept of Home Automation must he considered in relation to the new technologies and the new smart users and the house will no longer be regarded as a single entity, hut as a fundamental part of the new concept of city. The idea of smart cities is developing extremely rapidly, integrating smart grid, services, building, house and appliances, these subsystems must be able to interact, connect, and control remotely, collaboratively, to achieve a better quality of life, sustainability, energy saving, social and economic development. The widespread of Smart City depends heavily on the capability of users to understand and handle the ICT, IoT and BC. The paper designs a smart district model that is the step necessary to build a Smart City using new technologies and the role of an efficient energy management system integrated into a platform based on an IoT and BC approach for a replicable model and can be implemented.

AB We can perceive the advent of smart living spaces attributed to the fast emerging of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. By combining with the blockchain technology, many innovative business models can be brought into reality. This paper aims to report our recent progress in investigating the architectural issues for realizing blockchain-driven IoT services. In particular, we present and discuss four typical architectural styles for such services. A preliminary evaluation against different styles is also provided to compare the given styles.

AB As decentralized renewable energy has been installed into the present grid, millions of consumers and prosumers interacting each other over power grid. The variety of needs for exchanging energy would arise based on each customers' situation. The future electricity grid should be a bidirectional system with interconnected using distributed energy management software. Being able to provide a secure and decentralized control to these autonomous, peer-to-peer exchanges is one of the biggest challenges.
   We propose to use Blockchain-based electricity trading system with Digitalgrid router as an underlying platform because it could fit these requirements. Digitalgrid router, which consists back-to-back bi-directional digital inverters with software-based control, enables us to realize power exchange.

AB This paper identifies trust factor and rewarding nature of bitcoin system, and analyzes bitcoin features which may facilitate bitcoin to emerge as a universal currency. Paper presents the gap between proposed theoretical-architecture and current practical-implementation of bitcoin system in terms of achieving decentralization, anonymity of users, and consensus. Paper presents three different ways in which a user can manage bitcoins. We attempt to identify the security risk and feasible attacks on these configurations of bitcoin management. We have shown that not all bitcoin wallets are safe against all possible types of attacks. Bitcoin core is only safest mode of operating bitcoin till date as it is secure against all feasible attacks, and is vulnerable only against block-chain rewriting.

AB With(1) the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT) market and requirement, low power wide area (LPWA) technologies have become popular. In various LPWA technologies, Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and long range (LoRa) are two main leading competitive technologies. Comparing to NB-IoT network that mainly built and managed by mobile network operators, LoRa wide-area network (LoRaWAN) is mainly operated by private companies or organizations, which will bring the trust issues between application customers and network operations. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain technology based solution to build an open, trusted, decentralized and tamper-proof system for LoRaWAN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating blockchain technology and LoRaWAN IoT technology.

AB The development of robotics, the Internet of Things concept, big data processing techniques, automation, and distributed digital ledgers leads to the fourth industrial revolution. One of the main issues of new industry is interaction between the "smart factory" components both internally and with other factories based on the Internet of Things. This interaction should provide trust between the participants of the Internet of Things; control over the distribution of resources (such as maintenance time, energy, etc.) and finished products. The paper describes one of the possible ways of integrating Internet of Things and blockchain technologies to solve these issues. For this purpose, an architecture has been developed that combines Smart-M3 information sharing platform and blockchain platform. One of the main features of the proposed architecture is the use of smart contracts for processing and storing information related to the interaction between smart space components.

AB Blockchain is a relatively new technology that has shown a lot of possibilities. It emerged in 2009 as a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Blockchain technology is finding applications in wide range of areas: digital assets and stocks, smart contracts, record keeping, ID systems, cloud storage, ride sharing, etc. We investigate the blockchains' activity in terms of how to store, retrieve and share files in decentralized network.

AB The blockchain is a distributed ledger shared among computers around the world that allowing anyone to transact and do business with each other. Once a new block is created, ledger's transactions are updated and synchronized. Hence, the speed of information propagation in order to minimize the time taken by a node to verify a block before announcing it to the network is very significant that should be leveraged by the enabling technologies. However, due to the huge of data capacity needed, mode division multiplexing (MDM) is a promising approach to provide an additional level of freedom through propagating different channels in multimode fiber (MMF). Nevertheless, mode coupling is considered as the primary bandwidth impairment of MMF due to the mode's random perturbation. This paper investigates the potential of mode spacing in conjunction with a feed-forward equalizer on twisted Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) MDM. Free error transmission of 40Gbit/s over MMF is achieved. The bit-error-rate and eye diagram have been used as a measurement metrics.

DE transactive energy; energy blockchain; distributed generation
AB A recent report from the German Energy Agency analyzes the possible introduction of the blockchain technology in energy transactions in power distribution. The issue deserves attention since the extensive digitalization of business models puts new challenges to utilities in the power sector. The German decision makers in the energy field claim that blockchain appears as a close perspective and, at the same time, the Gartner hypecycle puts this technology at the peak of inflated expectations in 2016. Diffuse perception however provides hints for further investigation on the topic. This paper provides insight into the problem of peer-to-peer energy exchange from a technical perspective, providing evidence about an impossible guarantee for the so-called 'transparency' in energy transactions. A generic customer that buys energy from his neighbor that produces clean energy cannot have any guarantee about the origin of the energy he consumes, since it depends from the voltage distribution across the network. This assumption is even more realistic when different generation sources are distributed in the power distribution network, providing also voltage regulation services. It will be proved through some easy examples that, differently from other digital business models, such as Airbnb and Uber, the physical asset here plays a crucial role that cannot so easily be neglected.

DE Smart Grid; Energy Market; blockchain; smart contracts; renewable energy
AB Blockchain - software technology used for peer-to-peer transaction platforms - is being increasingly applied to alternative opportunities for a variety of industries and use cases such as also in the energy sector. As of now all energy related to blockchain applications are still in a concept stage. This paper aims to present the preliminary ideas of a research project that we have launched in collaboration with a small Fintech company: the Crypto-Trading project. From a research perspective we have explored how a blockchain-based system integrating smart contract functionality can be used to share energy in order to promote smart grids for the management of electricity in the Sardinia Region. From a technical perspective the project will implement a modular blockchain-based software platform for extending the features of cryptocurrency exchanges to the renewable Energy Market, including a robo-advisor which will suggest prosumers the best selling strategy. Blockchain technology shows a lot of promise. In our opinion this might boost the growth of renewable energy production and consequently also have a positive effect on the regional economy.

AB With the emergence of Bitcoin, businesses are focusing on leveraging Bitcoin's blockchain technology to non-cryptocurrency based applications to improve efficiency of the operations. These business applications operate in environments where participants have verified identities; these are called permissioned environments. Blockchain is an immutable and append only distributed ledger that can be utilized for record keeping applications. We observe that when blockchain technology is adapted from permissionless environments to permissioned environments the immutability of blockchain becomes questionable as the end-users may not monitor or store a copy of the blockchain. We propose the use of Keyless Signatures' Infrastructure as an additional mechanism to ensure irreversible and irrefutable proof of block confirmations which acts as a global proof thus preserving long term immutability of blockchain in permissioned environments.

AB Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) interconnects thousands of terminal devices to support the services of Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G area. However, centralized access authentication of each terminal has been performed in mobile core network which causes an extremely high operating and capital expenditure of network. Traditional C-RAN cannot provide an authentic mechanism to guarantee the security of services and creditability of device and resource accessing with low network cost. We first propose a blockchain-based trusted authentication (BTA) architecture for 5G with blockchain-based anonymous access (BAA) scheme in cloud radio over fiber network. The feasibility and efficiency are verified on enhanced SDN testbed to enable blockchain as a service.

TI Personalizing EU Private Law: From Disclosures to Nudges and Mandates

ID BIG DATA; ECONOMICS; BEHAVIOR; FACEBOOK
AB A key problem in EU private law is actor heterogeneity. While special rules exist for certain subgroups of actors, for example consumers or retail investors, the members of these legal categories still exhibit vast differences in behaviour, degrees of rationality, vulnerability, and economic endowment. Therefore, private law stands much to gain from tailoring its regulatory apparatus to the individual addressees. This article draws on behavioural economics and Big Data analytics to develop a comprehensive framework for the personalization of EU private law across different regulatory tools such as disclosures, nudges, and mandates. Hitherto, in market settings, data mining techniques have almost exclusively been used by tech-savvy companies. The time seems ripe for lawmakers to use digital technologies in order to take European market regulation one step further. By harnessing Big Data techniques, laws can be tailored to individual characteristics of addressees; the relevant parameters could then be stored and updated in a 'legal blockchain'. Through the use of different metrics and pseudonymization, the right to privacy, a key feature of European law in the digital age, can ultimately be respected. The article shows how laws can be personalized in a variety of different settings. Examples range from the salience and complexity of disclosures in consumer and investment law, to default caps on overdraft charges, debiasing optimism bias, and usury laws. Finally, it is argued that personalization can inspire a novel theory of legal categories which transcends the traditional, status-based dichotomies of, for example, 'consumer-seller' or 'retail-professional investor'. By providing a tool for making empirical distinctions, which affect the impact of laws, legally relevant, personalization thus ultimately serves equality before the law.

AB Blockchain technology is expected to revolutionize the way transactions are performed, thereby affecting a vast variety of potential areas of application. While expectations are high, real world impact and benefit are still unclear. To be able to assess its impact, the first structured literature review of peer-reviewed articles is conducted. As blockchain technology is centered around a peer-to-peer network, enabling collaboration between different parties, the service system is chosen as unit analysis to examine its potential contribution. We have identified a set of characteristics that enable trust and decentralization, facilitating the formation and coordination of a service system.

AB Thing-to-thing payments are a key enabler in the Internet of Things (IoT) era, to ubiquitously allow for devices to pay each other for services without any human interaction. Traditional credit card-based systems are not able to handle this new paradigm, however blockchain technology is a promising payment candidate in this context. The prominent example of blockchain technology is Bitcoin, with its decentralized structure and ease of account creation. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a smart cable that connects to a smart socket and without any human interaction pays for electricity. In this paper, we identify several obstacles for the widespread use of bitcoins in thing-to-thing payments. A critical problem is the high transaction fees in the Bitcoin network when doing micro transactions. To reduce this impact, we present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates multiple smaller payments incrementally into one larger transaction needing only one transaction fee. The proof-of concept shows that trustless, autonomous, and ubiquitous thing-to-thing micro-payments is no longer a future technology.

AB Swarms of embedded devices provide new challenges for privacy and security. We propose Permissioned Blockchains as an effective way to secure and manage these systems of systems. A long view of blockchain technology yields several requirements absent in extant blockchain implementations. Our approach to Permissioned Blockchains meets the fundamental requirements for longevity, agility, and incremental adoption. Distributed Identity Management is an inherent feature of our Permissioned Blockchain and provides for resilient user and device identity and attribute management.

AB The emerging blockchain technologies have enabled development of crypto-currencies and autonomous smart contracts that can operate in decentralized and trustless settings. Distributed autonomous organizations can be implemented using smart contracts available on the Ethereum blockchain. In this paper, we propose a distributed autonomous software organization model and its Ethereum smart contract implementation called AutonomousSoftwareOrg for providing a continuously operating virtual organization for software development communities and users. AutonomousSoftwareOrg facilitates a funding mechanism based on crypto-currencies, a decision making mechanism based on voting and record keeping for software usage citations and executions. AutonomousSoftwareOrg is deployed and tested on our local Ethereum based blockchain system (http://ebloc.cmpe.boun.edu.tr). Its Solidity language source code is available at https://github.com/ebloc/AutonomousSoftwareOrg.

AB The Cloud computing paradigm is built on the concept of virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines to cohabit on one physical device to enable the scaling up and down of applications through elastic on-demand provisioning. More recently containers e.g. Docker, have been shown to enable a more lightweight mechanism than hypervisors and proved to be a viable alternative for virtualization, based on shared operating systems. The advent of such lightweight environments has brought a multitude of application uses in research, science and industry, enabling pre-configured operating environments to be shared, reused and instantiated on demand. The sharing of containers has currently been exposed using centralized repositories (e.g. Dockerhub), which allows containers to be shared and to form the building blocks for further development. In this paper, we take a look at the next evolution of this lifecycle and consider whether it is viable to securely share container-based applications within a decentralized group of individuals and to provide an audit trail recording exactly who has shared what, and with whom. For this purpose we consider the use of Blockchain technologies, and consequently perform a comparative analysis of Blockchain technologies for this use case. The paper provides mostly a review and taxonomy of different ledger systems, which we believe may be of interest to the SafeData Workshop participants.

AB Bugs severely hurt blockchain system dependability. A thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is required to design effective tools for preventing, detecting and mitigating hugs. We perform an empirical study on hug characteristics in eight representative open source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108 bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs. Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports, and obtain ten hug categories in blockchain systems. We further investigate the frequency distribution of bug categories across projects and programming languages. Finally, we study the relationship between hug categories and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic hugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency distributions of bug types show similar trends across different projects and programming languages; (3) security hugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4) 35.71% performance bugs are fixed in more than one year; performance bugs take the longest average time to be fixed.

AB This paper presents first results of a project aiming to provide the requirements for enabling elderly people to stay longer in their flats or houses before moving to senior citizen's residences or nursing homes. Using market available devices an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system is developed for recording vital sign data. A minimal invasive radio transmission system and smart home sensors are installed. Data will be recorded, transferred and stored/managed in a private cloud-portal. On top of the recorded data a collaborative business model is developed enabling fair allocation of revenues. Data driven services will be developed and deployed. With the consent of the data owner (resident/client) data may be sold to external companies based on a data fair share concept. The compliance of data security policies will be achieved either by a data usage control system or by blockchain-based smart contracts.

AB Traditional cloud storage has relied almost exclusively on large storage providers, who act as trusted third parties to transfer and store data. This model poses a number of issues including data availability, high operational cost, and data security. In this paper, we introduce a system that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure distributed data storage with keyword search service. The system allows the client to upload their data in encrypted form, distributes the data content to cloud nodes and ensures data availability using cryptographic techniques. It also provides the data owner a capability to grant permission for others to search on her data. Finally, the system supports private keyword search over the encrypted dataset.

DE Bitcoin; blockchain; clustering; privacy; anonymity
AB Bitcoin is digital assets infrastructure powering the first worldwide decentralized cryptocurrency of the same name. All history of Bitcoins owning and transferring (addresses and transactions) is available as a public ledger called blockchain. But real-world owners of addresses are not known in general. That's why Bitcoin is called pseudo-anonymous. However, some addresses can be grouped by their ownership using behavior patterns and publicly available information from off-chain sources.
   Blockchain-based common behavior pattern analysis (common spending and one-time change heuristics) is widely used for Bitcoin clustering as votes for addresses association, while off-chain information (tags) is mostly used to verify results. In this paper, we propose to use off-chain information as votes for address separation and to consider it together with blockchain information during the clustering model construction step. Both blockchain and off-chain information are not reliable, and our approach aims to filter out errors in input data.
   The results of the study show the feasibility of a proposed approached for Bitcoin address clustering. It can be useful for the users to avoid insecure Bitcoin usage patterns and for the investigators to conduct a more advanced de-anonymizing analysis.

AB In this position paper, we initiate a systematic treatment of reaching consensus in a permissionless network. We prove several simple but hopefully insightful lower bounds that demonstrate exactly why reaching consensus in a permissionless setting is fundamentally more difficult than the classical, permissioned setting. We then present a simplified proof of Nakamoto's blockchain which we recommend for pedagogical purposes. Finally, we survey recent results including how to avoid well-known painpoints in permissionless consensus, and how to apply core ideas behind blockchains to solve consensus in the classical, permissioned setting and meanwhile achieve new properties that are not attained by classical approaches.

AB Blockchain provides a new approach for participants to maintain reliable databases in untrusted networks without centralized authorities. However, there are still many serious problems in real blockchain systems in IP network such as the lack of support for multicast and the hierarchies of status. In this paper, we design a bitcoin-like blockchain system named BlockNDN over Named Data Networking and we implement and deploy it on our cluster as well. The resulting design solves those problems in IP network. It provides completely decentralized systems and simplifies system architecture. It also improves the weak-connectivity phenomenon and decreases the broadcast overhead.

AB Existing authentication protocols for Big Data system such as Apache Hadoop is based on Kerberos. In the Kerberos protocol, there are numerous security issues that have remained unsolved; replay attacks, DDoS and single point of failure are some examples. These indicate potential security vulnerabilities and Big Data risks in using Hadoop. This paper presents drawbacks of Kerberos implementations and identifies authentication requirements that can enhance the security of Big Data in distributed environments. The enhancement proposed is based on the rising technology of blockchain that overcomes shortcomings of Kerberos.

AB Recently, various business models collect and store data generated from events using the Internet and various sensors and use them effectively. It is changing smartly into a convenient and safe new business model. In this paper, we present directions through experiments to understand and develop evolving types of business models by collecting data using various sensors in a test bed environment. We implement and experiment with technologies using Bigdata in addition to IoT(Internet of Things) technology. Renewable energy projects are attracting attention due to environmental issues such as global warming. In this paper, we introduce energy prosumer service model applying blockchain technology. This allows various energy sources to be connected to various users and producers. Also, we try to improve energy efficiency by analyzing energy pattern of users. We propose a transaction model that can collect, utilize, and process data more efficiently by combining the above technologies. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID SMART CONTRACTS
AB Breaches in online contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) are usually compensated by gift vouchers at present, however as the online contracts emerge towards smart contracts, the breaches could potentially lead to court injunctions over blockchains. This research proposes Probability based Factor Model (PFM) that can be implemented over the blockchain to automatically identify breaches that can cause substantial damage and have high probability for recurrence. PFM can also issue court injunctions for the breaches. The underlying concept in PFM is built upon the notion of factor analysis and stochastic modeling from the discipline of Data Science. High performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu) and docker (a software container platform) were used to emulate contractual environment of three service providers: Redis, MongoDB, and Memcached Servers. The results showed that court injunction(s) was issued only for Redis and MongoDB Servers. Technically, this difference could be attributed to the fact that Memcached is simply used for caching and therefore, it is less prone to breach of contract. Whereas, Redis and MongoDB as databases and message brokers are performing more complex operations and are more likely to cause a breach. This research will benefit enterprises that view breach of contract as a limiting factor for implementation of smart contract in cyber-physical system or internet of things.

AB Blockchain has recently gained momentum. Startups, enterprises, banks, and government agencies around the world are exploring the use of blockchain for broad applications including public registries, supply chains, health records, and voting. Dependability properties, like availability, are critical for many of these applications, but the guarantees offered by the blockchain technology remain unclear, especially from an application perspective. In this paper, we identify the availability limitations of two mainstream blockchains, Ethereum and Bitcoin. We demonstrate that while read availability of blockchains is typically high, write availability-for transaction managementis actually low. For Ethereum, we collected 6 million transactions over a period of 97 days. First, we measured the time for transactions to commit as required by the applications. Second, we observed that some transactions never commit, due to the inherent blockchain design. Third and perhaps even more dramatically, we identify the consequences of the lack of built-in options for explicit abort or retry that can maintain the application in an uncertain state, where transactions remain pending (neither aborted nor committed) for an unknown duration. Finally we propose techniques to mitigate the availability limitations of existing blockchains, and experimentally test the efficacy of these techniques.

AB While Blockchain network brings tremendous benefits, there are concerns whether their performance would match up with the mainstream IT systems. This paper aims to investigate whether the consensus process using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) could be a performance bottleneck for networks with a large number of peers. We model the PBFT consensus process using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN) to compute the mean time to complete consensus for networks up to 100 peers. We create a blockchain network using IBM Bluemix service, running a production-grade IoT application and use the data to parameterize and validate our models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis over a variety of system parameters and examine the performance of larger networks.

AB Numerous applications require users to interact with a multitude of entities in order to avail a service. In such applications, the identity of the user is typically verified through physical or digital tokens, which are prone to both identity theft (lost or stolen tokens) and repudiation claims by malicious users. The use of biometrics can provide non-repudiability by ensuring that a purchaser is the bonafide user of the service. However, in applications entailing multiple stakeholders, there may be privacy issues with sharing user's biometrics data. While this concern can be addressed by storing the user's biometric data on the token itself, strong mechanisms are required to ensure that token is both secure and tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a single use biometric token that relies on Shamir's secret sharing algorithm and blockchain technology to ensure that the encrypted biometric template contained in the token is secure, tamper-proof, and any attempt to use the issued token is irrefutably logged to prove subsequently that the user indeed availed the service. We also analyze issues related to the system security, user privacy, and usability of the proposed solution.

AB Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, promise to facilitate transactions on a decentralized computing platform among parties that have not established trust. Recognition of the unique challenges of blockchain programming has inspired developers to create domain-specific languages, such as Solidity, for programming blockchain systems. Unfortunately, bugs in Solidity programs have recently been exploited to steal money. We propose a new programming language, Obsidian, to make it easier for programmers to write correct programs.

AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) era new connected devices will spread highly sensitive personal data. Sending this type of data to centralized companies represents a serious risk for people's privacy, since economical or political interests could lead to an illegitimate use of personal information (as shown by Snowden's revelations). With the purpose of overcoming such status-quo, our research goal is to develop software systems according to the notion of decentralized private-by-design IoT. The basic idea is that data produced by personal IoT devices are safely stored in a distributed system whose design guarantees privacy, leaving to the people - the real data owners-the decision of which of them to share and with whom. To achieve this goal, a possible solution is to leverage the use of Peer-to-Peer storage networks in combination with the blockchain. However, such architecture, despite promising, embeds still limitations, especially in terms of scalability. In this paper we discuss our research motivation, we describe our research idea applied in a possible scenario and we present the scalability problem.

AB In this article, a secure and verifiable electronic voting scheme is proposed. Encrypted votes are accumulated and prepared in the form of block on each electronic polling booth at the end of polling time. The resultant block from each electronic polling booth is distributed to the authorized nodes of group for temper proof block chaining that assures the internal verifiability. The external verifiability is attained through the redistribution of temper proof Blockchain ledger to the validated and authorized nodes of auditing group. The temper proof property of electoral data is achieved using an emerging Blockchain Technology. Whereas the secure data distribution in the form of temper proof blocks and ledger amongst the authenticated group members is accomplished through the cryptographically secure group oriented scenario. The individual and universal verifiability features in our proposed scheme make the electoral process transparent, reliable and verifiable.

AB A blockchain powered Health information ecosystem can solve a frequently discussed problem of the lifelong recorded patient health data, which seriously could hurdle the privacy of the patients and the growing data hunger of the research and policy maker institutions. On one side the general availability of the data is vital in emergency situations and supports heavily the different research, population health management and development activities, on the other side using the same data can lead to serious social and ethical problems caused by malicious actors. Currently, the regulation of the privacy data varies all over the world, however underlying principles are always defensive and protective towards patient privacy against general availability. The protective principles cause a defensive, data hiding attitude of the health system developers to avoid breaching the overall law regulations. It makes the policy makers and different - primarily drug developers to find ways to treat data such a way that lead to ethical and political debates. In our paper we introduce how the blockchain technology can help solving the problem of secure data storing and ensuring data availability at the same time. We use the basic principles of the American HIPAA regulation, which defines the public availability criteria of health data, however the different local regulations may differ significantly. Blockchain's decentralized, intermediary-free, cryptographically secured attributes offer a new way of storing patient data securely and at the same time publicly available in a regulated way, where a well-designed distributed peer-to-peer network incentivize the smooth operation of a full-featured EHR system

This is especially important for the transactions between the collective actors on different hierarchical positions, e.g., the State and private companies or associations, or individuals. The fog computing' hardware and software are helpful for the aims of improving taxation and ensuring reliability of any transactions. The neuron technologies provide creating and developing a multi-criteria assessment of assets or actions, which represent more correct system of affective and socially acceptable evaluations, than it can be calculated on the basis of the cognitive judgments. The ability to provide a high level of information security through systems like Etherium allows of building a reliable and transparent system of taxation and of regulation of all interactions between social, economic and political agents, including the financial and non-financial measurements.

AB Emerging decentralized storage services such as Storj and Filecoin show promise as a new paradigm for data outsourcing. These services tie cryptocurrency to personal storage resources and leverage blockchain technology to ensure data integrity in distributed networks. Compared to current cloud storage, they are expected to be more scalable, cost effective, and secure. In addition to the features above, strong guarantees of data privacy are seriously desired due to today's prevalent data leak and abuse incidents. However, simply using end-to-end encryption limits the search capability and thus will degrade the user experience.
   In this paper, we propose an encrypted decentralized storage architecture that can support trustworthy and private keyword search functions. We start from searchable encryption to achieve search on encrypted data. Yet, only adopting this primitive is not sufficient to address particular threats in our target decentralized service model. Service peers would maliciously return incorrect results, while user peers would fraudulently refuse to pay service fees. To resolve those threats, we devise specific secure data addition and keyword search protocols to enable client-side verifiability and blockchain based fair judgments on the search results. For practical considerations, we integrate an efficient dynamic searchable encryption scheme to our protocols as an instantiation to lower the blockchain overhead. Our security and performance analysis indicates the advance of the proposed architecture.

AB Cloud-centric cognitive cellular networks utilize dynamic spectrum access and opportunistic network access technologies as a means to mitigate spectrum crunch and network demand. However, furnishing a carrier with personally identifiable information for user setup increases the risk of profiling in cognitive cellular networks, wherein users seek secondary access at various times with multiple carriers. Moreover, network access provisioning - assertion, authentication, authorization, and accounting - implemented in conventional cellular networks is inadequate in the cognitive space, as it is neither spontaneous nor scalable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhancing user identity management system using blockchain technology which places due importance on both anonymity and attribution, and supports end-to-end management from user assertion to usage billing. The setup enables network access using pseudonymous identities, hindering the reconstruction of a subscriber's identity. Our test results indicate that this approach diminishes access provisioning duration by up to 4x, decreases network signaling traffic by almost 40%, and enables near real-time user billing that may lead to approximately 3x reduction in payments settlement time.

ID RADIO NETWORKS
AB Cognitive cellular networks can enable opportunistic network access but their effectiveness relies on adaptive handoff algorithms. However, in cognitive radio networks the usufructuary rights of a secondary user are rescinded due to the unanticipated appearance of a primary user causing potential service disruption. In order to provide uninterrupted service to a cognitive cellular user, we propose elastic handoff as a composite framework of conventional cellular and voluntary spectrum handoffs. As with spectrum handoff, elastic handoff grants secondary users spectrum access while insulating them against the arrival of primary users. On the other hand, it is similar to cellular handoff in providing secondary users service assurance. The setup also offers users multiple network access choices, and affords carriers the means to generate additional revenue by capitalizing on excess capacity. We use a blockchain-based spectrum exchange and smart contracts to implement elastic handoff. Our tests show that user-initiated elastic handoff may reduce call drops by up to half compared to observations from a conventional cellular market, and network-initiated elastic handoff can improve a carrier's revenue maximization prospects.

AB The 2008 financial crisis had scattered incredulity around the globe regarding traditional financial systems, which made investors and non-financial customers turn to other alternative such as digital banking systems. The existence and development of blockchain technology make cryptocurrency in recent years believably become a complete alternative to traditional ones. Bitcoin is the world's first peer-to-peer and decentralized digital cash system initiated by Nakamoto [1]. Though being the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has not been a legal trading currency in various countries. Its exchange rate has appeared to be an exceptionally high-risk portfolio with extreme volatility, which requires a more detailed evaluation before making any decision. This paper utilizes knowledge of statistics for financial time series and machine learning to (i) fit the parametric distribution and (ii) model and forecast the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and (iii) analyze its correlation to other financial market indicators. The fitted parametric time series model significantly outperforms other standard models in explaining the stylized facts and statistical variances in the behavior of Bitcoin returns. The model forecast also outperforms some machine learning methodologies, which would benefit policy makers, banks and financial investors in trading activities for both long-term and short-term strategies.

AB Most blockchain systems are forkable in that they require participants to agree on a chain out of multiple possible branches of blocks. In this paper, we identify a new form of attack, called the Balance attack, against these forkable blockchain systems. The novelty of this attack consists of delaying network communications between multiple subgroups of nodes with balanced mining power. Our theoretical analysis captures the tradeoff between the network delay and the mining power of the attacker needed to double-spend in the GHOST protocol with high probability.
   We quantify our analysis in the settings of the Ethereum testnet of the R3 consortium where we show that a single machine needs to delay messages for 20 minutes to double spend while a coalition with a third of the mining power would simply need 4 minutes to double spend with 94% of success. We experiment the attack in our private Ethereum chain before arguing for a non-forkable blockchain design to protect against Balance attacks.

AB In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued, and the related applications have begun to be developed in large numbers. A smart contract is a software component encompass business logics and transactions that run on a blockchain. Thus, verifying whether the contract logics fully reflect the business requirements are one of the most important software engineering issues in blockchain application development. Currently, developing smart contracts is still a challenging task even for experienced programmers due to the lacking of an integrated tool for developing and testing. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a service platform that supports BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) smart contract development, testing, and deployment for the Ethereum-based blockchains. This platform focuses on providing and resolving the cross-cutting concerns across the life-cycle of smart contract development. The feasibility of this platform is shown by demonstrating how an application scenario, namely, loyalty points exchange, can be implemented using the proposed platform. Our experiences indicate that the burdens of developers when developing smart contracts can be effectively reduced and thus increases the quality of contracts.

AB Various pieces of personal information are correlated to the My Number program, which establishes national identification numbers that are unique to each citizen and resident of Japan. Hence, its protection is paramount. However, whereas the aim of current security measures is to prevent leaks directly, we must consider the possibility of non-secret information being used to indirectly leak secret information by inference. We studied a hypergraph-based model that is used to prevent the possibility of information leaks by inference. Only reading operations are considered in our previous works. However, writing operations have to be considered. We propose covert channel analysis models with inference rules and reading and writing operations. In addition, management mechanisms for the history of accesses to objects by users are required to analysis the satisfaction of the inference rules. If the history of accesses are altered, the information leakages by the inference attack are occurred. In our research, a block chain is used to manage the access log to solve problems mentioned above. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic access control model with access log managed by the blockchain and the inference path detection model.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB Applications requiring strict access control, such as medical record query, often require auditing of the query. The current typical design relies on server side logging. However, logging on server-side do not provide strict means of auditing, since the server can be tampered with attackers, and also anybody who has permission to write can modify the log. We propose a scheme using blockchain technology, as a request-response channel for a client-server system, to record both client request and server reply in an audi-table manner. We have implemented a proof-of-concept system on top of a publicly available blockchain testbed. By using a blockchain as a client-server request-response channel, the request-response sequence can be verified by anybody who has access to the blockchain, providing a way to implement audit log for strictly controlled resources.

AB In contrast to electronic travel documents (e.g. ePass-ports), the standardisation of breeder documents (e.g. birth certificates), regarding harmonisation of content and contained security features is in statu nascendi. Due to the fact that breeder documents can be used as an evidence of identity and enable the application for electronic travel documents, they pose the weakest link in the identity life cycle and represent a security gap for identity management.
   In this work, we present a cost efficient way to enhance the long-term security of breeder documents by utilizing blockchain technology. A conceptual architecture to enhance breeder document long-term security and an introduction of the concept's constituting system components is presented. Our investigations provide evidence that the Bitcoin blockchain is most suitable for breeder document long-term security.

AB The article attempts to identify the formal and essential features of the modern virtual currency, to provide a classification of virtual currencies, to identify the main factors influencing the demand and supply of virtual currencies, to analyze the key indicators of development of virtual currency schemes to determine their market prospects in payment system.
   The study determined that virtual currencies differ from traditional currencies and electronic money in the narrow sense. The main innovations related to the development of schemes of virtual currency are two key elements: the asset factor and payment factor. The main criteria for the classification of virtual currencies are: 1) the ability to convert virtual currency to traditional currency; 2) the organizational and technological features of the issue of virtual currencies.
   The study identified the main advantages of using virtual currencies for payment participants: 1) relatively short time for verification and settlement of payment transactions; 2) the high anonymity pf payment transactions; 3) relatively low transaction costs. However, currently only a few of decentralized schemes of virtual currencies are original from the point of view of a cryptographic scheme of issuing and accounting currency units. Among the virtual currencies with the highest market capitalization in the world are: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Reeple. Refs 32. Figs 5. Tables 3.

ID PROOFS
AB We put forward a new framework that makes it possible to re-write or compress the content of any number of blocks in decentralized services exploiting the blockchain technology. As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to "the right to be forgotten."
   Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS '00), which allow determining hash collisions efficiently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin).
   We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of a redactable blockchain, building on top of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core. The prototype only requires minimal changes to the way current client software interprets the information stored in the blockchain and to the current blockchain, block, or transaction structures. Moreover, our experiments show that the overhead imposed by a redactable blockchain is small compared to the case of an immutable one.

AB Recordkeeping professionals build and manage systems that support the creation and maintenance of trustworthy records, however our approach to the design and implementation of such systems has suffered from a lack of innovation and a failure to collaborate effectively with allied disciplines. Contemporary society, politics and Internet culture are producing new models, tools and techniques which open up exciting possibilities for how recordkeeping systems might work, presenting both opportunities and challenges for recordkeeping professionals. In this article, some elements deemed necessary for trustworthy recordkeeping are identified and critically examined in light of the possibilities of participatory cultures, peer-to-peer business and trust through computation, in particular, blockchain technologies. Conclusions are drawn regarding what might be needed in order to adapt current models and practices to build new forms of recordkeeping systems that could enhance the agency of the individual in a networked society.

AB In this paper we make a critical review of the existing technology in the smart cities and smart grid paradigms from the security perspective. First we summarize the findings about the evolution of renewable technology over time and in particular the benefits of a Cost reduction potential for solar and wind power in the period 2015-2025. Then we build from existing sources to high-light different ways for efficiency improvement in solar panel solutions during 1975-2015. Next we analyze growth of the smart metering and smart grid technology in the world. Also, the existing Blockchain solutions are critically reviewed in regard to cyber infrastructure security. From these findings we conclude that there is an increasing need for developing new Blockchain so- lutions in the smart grids ecosystem.

AB Blockchain Technology (BCT) is the newest challenge when consider the security of distributed databases inspired from distributed ledgers introduced in order to manage Bitcoin transactions. However, BCT is more than Bitcoin. This technology can be applied in various fields including education. In this work, not only an overview on the BCT, but many details are described when apply BCT in education not only by individual institutions, but also by groups of institutions or at national level. A short list of applications includes: school records management (Student transcript/degree/test score/record validation and transfer, including those associated with college admissions); educator credentialing/certffication/re-certification (including across state and national lines); management and tracking of school assets (like property, buses, furniture, textbooks, library books/journals, and technology); management of student privacy and parental opt in/opt out permissions; management of special education/school lunch/attendance records; distribution of public programmatic funds or private grants; distribution and payment of student loans; license/dissertation/PhD thesis management.

AB With the promotion of electric power reform in China, distributed energy participating in power market transaction becomes possible. However, due to the characteristics of transaction decentralization, multiple energy synergies, information symmetry and the large quantity, the transaction cost and the risk of information leak increase significantly, which inhibits the enthusiasm of distributed energy to participate in electric power transaction. The block chain has been widely used in finance, logistics and other industries because of its decentralized data processing. In this paper, the characteristics and infrastructure of the block chain is analyzed and the distributed energy trading frame work based on the block chain is built. The result shows that block chain has significant effect on the information security of the energy transaction.

AB After years of tremendous development and research in digital currency, the most famous Bitcoin industry chain has been gradually completed including mining, exchange, currency exchange, ATM, pervasive digital wallet design and so on. Especially, its blockchain technology has become FinTech organizations' emerging business and research directions, also been applied in the interdisciplinary medical science, supply chain and Internet of things. Digitizing currency can solve many problems in physical currency, such as the rampant counterfeit banknotes. Thus, not only the transparency can be cost-effectively preserved in store's ledger, but also customer's rights and interests can be protected while using the digital wallet. For the government, the regulation and auditing of financial transaction can be made simpler and more convenient for tax collection issue. Digitized transaction details can be much easier to audit by any computing device than manually audit the conventional ledger books. Furthermore, to make merchandise store to use digitized currency much easier, in this paper, we propose and deploy a Bitcoin collection supervision system called BPCSS based on blockchain technology with cloud databases for customers and merchandise stores. The preliminary experimental results via the well-known pervasive digital wallet of Testnet Bitcoin demonstrate the proposed BPCSS can cost-effectively collect payment and supervise the transactions between customer and merchandise store running the implemented NFC-enabled Android Apps.

AB Bitcoin madness, the boom of the crypto economy, a new gold rush - if we let ourselves be influenced by the mood of these news headlines it might make us feel like we are in the early nineties with the dotcom boom repeating itself again along with the threat of a breaking bubble that finally happened. If we rather opt to examine the core blockchain technology that underlies these headlines, it might lead to something with real significance: the transaction system between two sides without an intermediary (state - financial institution) involved is set to change significantly as there is a technological solution that can guarantee cheaper transactions that are more secure and directly carried out between the parties. This may lead to a major change in society that is only comparable to urbanization and the evolution of hierarchical societies 10,000-12,000 years ago. According to our view, this aspect makes the real / possible social effects of blockchain open to interpretation by the theory, definitions and terms of social macroevolution. A large part of the puzzle is not yet finished, but a decentralized public blockchain may lead to a new era of social control over transactions. In this study, we revisit the basics of the Blockchain World, its history, recent developments and its social, political and historical context.

CL Geneva, SWITZERLAND
AB A blockchain is a public ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. However, amid the current hype around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, fintech startups, and novel consensus mechanisms, it is sometimes overlooked that assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a protocol is a difficult task.
   We argue that developing consensus protocols is similar to engineering cryptographic systems, and that blockchain developers should look towards the established experience in cryptography and security with building trustworthy systems. Otherwise, it might be dangerous to entrust financial value to new protocols. Public discussion, expert reviews, broad validation, and standards recommendations should be employed, following the established practice in cryptography and security.

AB In the context of current energy Internet, the emergence of a large number of energy productive consumers will create a new business model. In the decentralized electricity market, the cost of traditional centralized solution construction, management and maintenance is too high, and it is difficult to support the collection, transmission, reception, storage and analysis of massive data. To provide a solution to this phenomenon, we apply the blockchain technology to this distributed electricity market to achieve peer to peer transactions in the power systems. The blockchain technology which is very popular nowadays will be used in power system to establish a credible direct transaction between devices. At first, this article analyzes the future direction of the development of power systems, studies the characteristics of decentralized power systems and summarizes the main issues in the development process. Then, we analyze the basic characteristics of blockchain and put forward a new transaction framework in consideration of problems existing in current energy market. The transaction framework is based on the blockchain technology in the distributed electricity market and includes the pricing method, the power transaction system architecture, various modules of the trading system and the details of the whole transaction system runtime. This framework provides a viable solution for increasingly complex energy transactions.

AB We are experiencing an ever-larger gap and an ever growing solid disconnect between existing knowledge in the public policy of international trade or factors of global and national economic growth and the discourse of contemporaneous presidential and parliamentary election debates, in the US, Europe, and elsewhere alike. At the same time we are experiencing an ever-decreasing attention given in national and state political races and further political discourse to issues of major concern to ever larger and larger groups of engaged citizenry. Similarly, the continued effects of the 2008 economic crisis combine with the current hot beds in international security and the refugee crisis as factors contributing to the amplifying of extremist xenophobic political discourses across the Western world.
   In spite of the worrying trends identified above we propose what might seem as a complete opposite: the application to politico-socio-economic evolution of humankind of an analytical tool with the potential to offer an optimistic perspective for humankind's future. It is flows and the trends over time that characterize flows.
   Stemming from advanced thermodynamics, the constructal theory of design and evolution in nature proposes that 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.' In papers [1] and [2] authors Bejan and Marden, and Bejan and Lorente, verify the constructal law at the design of both inanimate systems with flow (rivers basins, turbulent flow structure, self-lubrication) and animate systems with flow (lung design, cardiovascular system design, animal locomotion).
   Similarly, Bejan also proposes the general application of the constructal law to humankind made systems ([3-5]). Social systems, political systems, economic systems (the financial and monetary system, the system of trade and exchanges of raw materials, industrial products and services), the system of intangible capital flows globally (knowledge, human capital, market capital, and process capital) might all be governed by the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. We propose an interdisciplinary research agenda encompassing a multitude of disciplines that need to focus their efforts in the direction of verifying how well constructal law applies to socio-economic systems, and how its analytical and predictive power can inform global public policy making. As a case study, we trace several trends in global political economy, and particularly in the evolution of the monetary system from transactional money-less exchanges through the middle ages, Bretton Woods, US Exit from the gold standard (or the Nixon shock), Bretton Woods II, and currently in the post-2008 rise of the "alternative virtual currencies era," trends that justify why we believe in the application of the contructal law to socioeconomic systems. We explore the reasons for the rise of the latest trends with bitcoin, blockchain, and peer-and micro-lending and direct mobile phone based payment systems, and how all these fit inside a constructal law explanation. We then dare some future epistemic development predictions in the future practice and law of bitcoin and blochchain, by comparing them as a case study with recent developments in other connected and more mature areas of the law of e-commerce.

AB To improve the efficiency of state management, a system of distributed situational centers (SDSC) is being created. In the article authors examined the problems of development and introduction of situational centers (SC) as components of SDSC, and in particular they paid attention to the problem of interaction and data exchange. The main goal of the work is the development of SDSC creation technology, which is to solve the problem of interaction of nodes, increase the design speed of a particular SC. Various solutions to these problems are taken into consideration. Authors proposed an approach for the creation of SDSC as a decentralized peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant network, in which nodes are unified situational centers. For the design of such a SC, it is proposed to use the data model of the "categories of entities and relations" and the model of the unified virtual work environment. The possibility of using blockchain technology for organizing a common secure data warehouse and consensus building algorithms for resolving conflicts between network nodes is examined.

AB Introduction of computers in all spheres of life substantially changed the ways of how people communicate and exchange information. It is creating a virtually paperless work environment.
   Keyless Signatures Infrastructures are an alternative solution to traditional PKI signatures. Storing and safely sending a large amount of information is a problem on one side, on the other hand increasing communication between things (for example smart cars, consumer houses etc.) requires a secure exchange of information where the blockchanging method is promising.

AB In this paper a novel feedback controller and stability analysis of a blockchain implementation is developed by using a control engineering perspective. The controller output equals the difficulty adjustment in the mining process while the feedback variable is the average block time over a certain time period. The computational power (hash rate) of the miners is considered a disturbance in the model. The developed controller is tested against a simulation model with constant disturbance, step and ramp responses as well as with a high-frequency sinusoidal disturbance. Stability and a fast response is demonstrated in all these cases with a controller which adjusts it's output at every new block. Finally the performance of the controller is implemented and demonstrated on a testnet with a constant hash rate as well as on the mainnet of a public open source blockchain project.

AB Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting-anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents "sybil attacks" (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. "moderately hard functions") introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92).
   The analysis of the blockchain consensus protocol (a.k.a. Nakamoto consensus) has been a notoriously difficult task. Prior works that analyze it either make the simplifying assumption that network channels are fully synchronous (i.e. messages are instantly delivered without delays) (Garay et al. Eurocrypt'15) or only consider specific attacks (Nakamoto'08; Sampolinsky and Zohar, FinancialCrypt'15); additionally, as far as we know, none of them deal with players joining or leaving the protocol.
   In this work we prove that the blockchain consensus mechanism satisfies a strong forms of consistency and liveness in an asynchronous network with adversarial delays that are a-priori bounded, within a formal model allowing for adaptive corruption and spawning of new players, assuming that the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. (We complement this result by showing a simple attack against the blockchain protocol in a fully asynchronous setting, showing that the "puzzle-hardness" needs to be appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay; this attack applies even for static corruption.)
   As an independent contribution, we define an abstract blockchain protocol and identify appropriate security properties of such protocols; we prove that Nakamoto's blockchain protocol satisfies them and that these properties are sufficient for typical applications; we hope that this abstraction may simplify further applications of blockchains.

DE active ageing; blockchain; smart contracts; user-centered design
AB Health management and wellbeing are critical topics for senior citizens as the associated healthcare related costs tend to rise. There are various efforts to promote active ageing as a way to balance physical, social and mental wellbeing for the elders. Among the aspects that are considered in a preventive healthcare strategy, physical activity is one of the most important components, as it was evidenced that physical inactivity is the main risk factor for many serious health conditions. This paper introduces an application scenario for senior citizens that engage in a physical activity program which is recommended by a medical expert. The other stakeholders involved are a private insurance company and medical service provider. The agreements between these parties and the corresponding economic compensations are specified in a smart contract that is executed in a private blockchain. The design of the user interface follows the PACT (people, activities, contexts, technologies) framework, and for the evaluation of its impact it was proposed the model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) methodology.

AB Blockchain is considered as the important technological innovation behind Bitcoin system. It facilitates the transaction payment process by creating a decentralized, general ledger to improve regulatory capacity and remove unnecessary intermediaries. At present, the blockchain technology has been employed in the financial industry for a wide range of experimental application and exploration. In this paper, we firstly analyze the principle architecture and the technical characteristics of blockchain. Then its current research achievements and application scenarios are introduced. Finally, the application of blockchain in China Foreign Exchange Trade System is designed and explored. Combining with the credit matching trading system X-Swap, an inter-bank application based on the blockchain technology is implemented.

AB Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging of digital transactions. It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain.
   We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy.
   We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction.

DE Blockchain; E-Voting; Zcash; zk-SNARK
AB Voting systems have been around for hundreds of years and despite different views on their integrity, have always been deemed secure with some fundamental security and anonymity principles. Numerous electronic systems have been proposed and implemented but some suspicion has been raised regarding the integrity of elections due to detected security vulnerabilities within these systems. Electronic voting, to be successful, requires a more transparent and secure approach, than is offered by current protocols. The approach presented in this paper involves a protocol developed on blockchain technology. The underlying technology used in the voting system is a payment scheme, which offers anonymity of transactions, a trait not seen in blockchain protocols to date. The proposed protocol offers anonymity of voter transactions, while keeping the transactions private, and the election transparent and secure. The underlying payment protocol has not been modified in any way, the voting protocol merely offers an alternative use case.

AB Blockchain may help solve several complex problems related to integrity and trustworthiness of rapid, distributed, complex energy transactions and data exchanges. In a move towards resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions. This may help reduce transactive energy costs and increase the security and sustainability of distributed energy resource (DER) integration, helping to remove barriers to a more decentralized and resilient power grid. This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts to improve smart grid cyber resiliency and secure transactive energy applications.

AB We examine different opportunities to implement the blockchain technology into online payment and sales transaction systems with a focus on the financial sector of the German speaking area in Europe. To this end, we conduct a literature review and conduct a questionnaire survey among payment transaction experts. In addition the advantages and disadvantages are pointed out as well as other applications. Results from the survey suggest that many experts are investigating the new technology, but the efforts made at Austrian, German and Swiss banks are low since there are still many open issues pending. Especially setting up a legal framework for the international treatment of payment transactions based on the blockchain would be an important step.

AB Community detection is an important aspect of social network analysis, but social factors such as user intimacy, influence, and user interaction behavior are often overlooked as important factors. Most of the existing methods are single classification algorithms; multi-classification algorithms that can discover overlapping communities are still incomplete. In former works, we calculated intimacy based on the relationship between users, and divided them into their social communities based on intimacy. However, a malicious user can obtain the other user relationships, thus to infer other users interests, and even pretend to be the another user to cheat others. Therefore the information users concerned about needs to be transferred in the manner of privacy protection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy preserving algorithm to preserve the privacy of information in social networks. First, during expansion of communities on the base of mining seed, in order to prevent others from malicious users, we verify their identities after they send a request. We make use of the recognition and nontampering of the block chain to store the user's public key and bind to the block address, which is used for authentication. At the same time, in order to prevent the honest but curious users from illegal access to other users' information, we do not send plaintext directly after the authentication, but hash the attributes by mixed hash encryption to make sure that users can only calculate the matching degree rather than know specific information of other users. Analysis shows that our protocol would serve well against different types of attacks.

AB Our personal data is now more valuable than ever. The uncontrolled growth of internet-centered services has led us to accept many compromises about how we share it. In the era of Internet of Things, personal data is collected continuously. Now, more than ever, we are in need of privacy-preserving applications where users always retain control of their personal data. In this paper, we present a secure way to control the flow of personal data in the specific case of the recruitment of participants for clinical trials. We take special care to protect the interests of both parties: the individual can keep its data private until an agreement is reached, and the Clinical Research Institute can be assured that it is acquiring useful and authentic data. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and study its performance based on a real-world evaluation.

AB To support dynamic communities of interests in coalition operations, new architectures for efficient sharing of ISR assets are needed. The use of blockchain technology in wired business environments, such as digital currency systems, offers an interesting solution by creating a way to maintain a distributed shared ledger without requiring a single trusted authority. In this paper, we discuss how a blockchain-based system can be modified to provide a solution for dynamic asset sharing amongst coalition members, enabling the creation of a logically centralized asset management system by a seamless policy-compliant federation of different coalition systems. We discuss the use of blockchain for three different types of assets in a coalition context, showing how blockchain can offer a suitable solution for sharing assets in those environments. We also discuss the limitations in the current implementations of blockchain which need to be overcome for the technology to become more effective in a decentralized tactical edge environment.

AB Green transportation such as electric vehicles are emerging as an alternative to the traditional vehicles primarily due to the increasing cost and need of petroleum energy worldwide. These electric vehicle operate by using electric charging and the way to charge an electric car is to use a mobile charger or use a charging infrastructure. Therefore, when a mobile charger is used, a billing system is required through which a user is billed who has charged the electric vehicle. In this paper, we propose a mobile charger billing system that utilizes Blockchain technology. This technology has been applied to achieve more secure online transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. Moreover, we analyze the requirements of mobile charger for billing and propose a lightweight scheme that can overcome the challenge of data size in existing Blockchain.

AB The aims of this paper is to provide a conceptual context for new technologies around smart contracts and blockchain together with Internet of things. Blockchain, smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations have received significant attention recently. In the world of Internet of things, we can build very interesting concepts of use with these new technologies. This paper is focused on related issues for new complex solutions and implementation in enterprise world. In this regard, I first provide a brief overview of the core aspects of these technologies, as well as the smart contracts-based developments for Internet of things. I discuss key issues that must be considered in developing such as blockchain-based technologies in Internet of things context. The result of this effort is to show that future Internet of things application allows the contingency of future events to be more robustly orchestrated through smart contracts.

AB P2P-based M2M application frameworks have several advantages, such as increased flexibility, efficiency and a lack of single point of failure as compared to centralised approaches. However, there are several security drawbacks which need to be addressed in order to provide the user a secure environment for the provision and usage of M2M applications. This publication presents different security issues inside P2Pbased M2M application frameworks and evaluates P2P protocols based on security. In order to avoid different security attacks, the concept of trust and its importance are emphasized. Furthermore, a trust management system with special trust metric parameters is presented which considers the architecture of P2P-based M2M applications. Finally, blockchain principles are integrated for optimising the overall security in the system by improving data storage between peers, avoiding volatility of peers and ensuring correct working M2M applications.

AB Existing distributed ledger implementations - specifically, several blockchain implementations - embody a cacophony of divergent capabilities augmenting innovations of cryptographic hashes, consensus mechanisms, and asymmetric cryptography in a wide variety of applications. Whether specifically designed for cryptocurrency or otherwise, several distributed ledgers rely upon modular mechanisms such as consensus or smart contracts. These components, however, can vary substantially among implementations; differences involving proof-of-work, practical byzantine fault tolerance, and other consensus approaches exemplify distinct distributed ledger variations. Such divergence results in unique combinations of modules, performance, latency, and fault tolerance. As implementations continue to develop rapidly due to the emerging nature of blockchain technologies, this paper encapsulates a snapshot of sensor and internet of things (IoT) specific implementations of blockchain as of the end of 2016. Several technical risks and divergent approaches preclude standardization of a blockchain for sensors and IoT in the foreseeable future; such issues will be assessed alongside the practicality of IoT applications among Hyperledger, Iota, and Ethereum distributed ledger implementations suggested for IoT. This paper contributes a comparison of existing distributed ledger implementations intended for practical sensor and IoT utilization. A baseline for characterizing distributed ledger implementations in the context of IoT and sensors is proposed. Technical approaches and performance are compared considering IoT size, weight, and power limitations. Consensus and smart contracts, if applied, are also analyzed for the respective implementations' practicality and security. Overall, the maturity of distributed ledgers with respect to sensor and IoT applicability will be analyzed for enterprise interoperability.

AB Decentralization, on one hand, brings more transparency and trust to the parties involved in transactions, but on the other hand, it narrows possibilities for central control. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a recent decentralized innovation in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) that acts as self-sustainable ledger for documenting transactions self-protected against counterfeiting and hacker attacks. The aim of the current research paper is to reveal opportunities and barriers for utilization of distributed ledgers in the context of EU digital single market strategy. The main tasks are (1) to analyze functionality dynamics of existing distributed ledgers, (2) to analyze utilization areas of distributed ledgers, (3) to analyze digital trends related to utilization of distributed ledgers within the EU. The current research paper utilizes methods of content analysis, grounded theory, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The research has revealed that half of EU Digital Single Market priorities can be facilitated through distributed ledgers.

DE Video Teaching; Web Lectures; constructive alignment; interactive
   classroom; Curriculum Innovation; Blended Learning
AB Micro-credentialing combined with Blockchain, MOOCs and free online course provide sufficient motivation for Higher Education to critically evaluate its long term role in educating the next generation. A changing student population and the continual technological developments puts pressure on universities to blend, flip and video classes. Many organisations feel the need to follow suit as education lurches from the age old tradition of the "Sage on the stage" to the "Guide on the side". This shift impacts teaching spaces, expectations regarding student approaches to learning, and requires the development of a new didactic approach. Teachers who are used to 'sending' knowledge during traditional lectures to halls filled with students, find themselves appearing in front of green screens, segmenting their classes into short video chunks, and developing more interactive learning sessions. Are these the right choices to follow, based on what empirical evidence and how can we ensure that this process is positive for all involved? A tourism 'model' was segmented into 40 short (58 minute) web lectures (studio recorded videos with power point slides) on a university course. Over six semesters, the content was reverse engineered into the course structure, and 'constructively aligned' with assessment goals. Each course iteration enabled the embedded content to be actively implemented more deeply, through interactive workshops, peer teaching, student generated video clips and student formulated exam questions. Teaching through the video lens resulted in the development of a new didactic approach for the lecturer. Both the on-screen 'Video Teaching' persona, and the new interactive role in class were enabled as a result of the catalyzing possibilities of video and the 'digitization' of the teacher. Student perceptions of this learning approach reveal positive support for this format. The ongoing research into this subject is supporting the transition of lecturers into this new didactic both in The Netherlands and internationally.

AB Cloud federations are a new collaboration paradigm where organizations share data across their private cloud infrastructures. However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by federated organizations' concerns on potential risks of data leakage and data misuse. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose a novel identity and access management system for cloud federations. The system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes to the federated organization owning data. The system also guarantees the integrity of the policy evaluation process by using blockchain technology and Intel SGX trusted hardware. It uses blockchain to ensure that users identity attributes and access control policies cannot be modified by a malicious user, while Intel SGX protects the integrity and confidentiality of the policy enforcement process. We present the access control protocol, the system architecture and discuss future extensions.

AB Cloud federation is an emergent cloud-computing paradigm where partner organisations share data and services hosted on their own cloud platforms.
   In this context, it is crucial to enforce access control policies that satisfy data protection and privacy requirements of partner organisations. However, due to the distributed nature of cloud federations, the access control system alone does not guarantee that its deployed components cannot be circumvented while processing access requests.
   In order to promote accountability and reliability of a distributed access control system, we present a decentralised runtime monitoring architecture based on blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain - the innovation behind Bitcoin - enables people to exchange digital money with complete trust, and seems to be completely transforming the way we think about trust. While blockchain is designed for secured, immutable funds transfer in trustless and decentralized environment, the underlying storage of blockchain is very simple with only limited supports for data access. Moreover, blockchain data are highly compressed before flushing to hard disk, making it harder to have an insight of these valuable data set. In this work, we develop EtherQL, an efficient query layer for Ethereum - the most representative open-source blockchain system. EtherQL provides highly efficient query primitives for analyzing blockchain data, including range queries and top-k queries, which can be integrated with other applications with much flexibility. Moreover, EtherQL is designed to provide different levels of abstraction, which are suitable for data analysts, researchers and application developers.

AB While online services emerge in all areas of life, the voting procedure in many democracies remains paper-based as the security of current online voting technology is highly disputed. We address the issue of trustworthy online voting protocols and recall therefore their security concepts with its trust assumptions. Inspired by the Bitcoin protocol, the prospects of distributed online voting protocols are analysed. No trusted authority is assumed to ensure ballot secrecy. Further, the integrity of the voting is enforced by all voters themselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We introduce a taxonomy of notions of distribution in online voting protocols that we apply on selected online voting protocols. Accordingly, blockchain-based protocols seem to be promising for online voting due to their similarity with paper-based protocols.

AB Bitcoin is an open source payment system with a market capitalization of about 15 G$. During the years several key management solutions have been proposed to enhance bitcoin. The common characteristic of these techniques is that they allow to derive public keys independently of the private keys, and that these keys match. In this paper we overview the historical development of such techniques, specify and compare all major variants proposed or used in practical systems. We show that such techniques can be designed based on 2 distinct ECC arithmetic properties and how to combine both. A major trend in blockchain systems is to use by Stealth Address (SA) techniques to make different payments made to the same payee unlikable. We review all known SA techniques and show that early variants are less secure. Finally we propose a new SA method which is more robust against leakage and against various attacks.

ID AGGREGATION
AB Serious games can be used to push consumers of common-pool resources toward socially responsible consumption patterns. However, gamified interactions can result in privacy leaks and potential misuses of player-provided data. In the Smart Grid ecosystem, a smart metering framework providing some basic cryptographic primitives can enable the implementation of serious games in a privacy-friendly manner. This paper presents a smart metering architecture in which the users have access to their own high-frequency data and can use them as the input data to a multi-party secure protocol. Authenticity and correctness of the data are guaranteed by the usage of a public blockchain. The framework enables a gaming platform to administer a set of team game activities aimed at promoting a more sustainable usage of energy and water. We discuss and assess the performance of a protocol based on Shamir secret sharing scheme, which enables the members of the teams to calculate their overall consumption and to compare it with those of other teams without disclosing individual energy usage data. Additionally, the protocol impedes that the game platform learns the meter readings of the players (either individual or aggregated) and their challenge objectives.

AB Almost all real world activities have been digitized and there are various client server architecture based systems in place to handle them. These are all based on trust on third parties. There is an active attempt to successfully implement blockchain based systems which ensures that the IT systems are immutable, double spending is avoided and cryptographic strength is provided to them. A successful implementation of blockchain as backbone of existing information technology systems is bound to eliminate various types of fraud and ensure quicker delivery of the item on trade. To adapt IT systems to blockchain architecture, an efficient consensus algorithm need to be designed. Blockchain based on proof of work first came up as the backbone of cryptocurrency. After this, several other methods with variety of interesting features have come up. In this paper, we conduct a survey on existing attempts to achieve consensus in block chain. A federated consensus method and a proof of validation method are being compared.

AB Analyzing 242 articles related to the study of blockchain which were published in China and abroad from 2014 to 2016, and from the aspects of literature sources, research subjects, research methods and western countries, the basic frame of blockchain research classification is put forward. Summarize the current blockchain technology progress, research limitations and future development trends. The research shows that the domestic research on the blockchain is more decentralized, non-systematic, and has not reached a certain research depth. What's more, it is lack of quantitative analysis. Digital currency, Internet finance, and the risk of blockchain technology research will be the focus of future research.

ID CHALLENGES; INTERNET; THINGS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as "miner" that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.

AB In order to fully consider the impact of future policies and technologies on the electricity sales market, improve the efficiency of electricity market operation, realize the dual goal of power reform and energy saving and emission reduction, this paper uses multi-level decision theory to put forward the double-layer game model under the consideration of ETS and block chain. We set the maximization of electricity sales profit as upper level objective and establish a game strategy model of electricity purchase; while we set maximization of user satisfaction as lower level objective and build a choice behavior model based on customer satisfaction. This paper applies the strategy to the simulation of a sales company's transaction, and makes a horizontal comparison of the same industry competitors as well as a longitudinal comparison of game strategies considering different factors. The results show that Double-layer game model is reasonable and effective, it can significantly improve the efficiency of the electricity sales companies and user satisfaction, while promoting new energy consumption and achieving energy-saving emission reduction.

DE self-sovereignty; notary; blockchain; privacy; personal data store;
   autonomy
AB In the Big Data era, personal metadata may will become a new type of corporate asset, however there have already been a growing public concern about user's privacy mined from metadata. In this paper we address the problem of implementing the self-sovereignty of personal metadata on the existing OpenPDS/SafeAnswers framework according to the Windhover Principle. In order to do that, we propose a new framework, called BlocakChain-based Personal Data Store (BC-PDS), to realize two basic properties: notary and autonomy. This framework, firstly introduces the BlockChain as a notary, into OpenPDS/ SafeAnswers for secure storage of personal meta-data instead of the original database. Next, we present an AutoNomybased Access Control (ANAC) to improve the SafeAnswers module, where ANAC is a new mechanism that enforces access based on the relationship among all authorized users and metadata's owner. In addition, we also propose General Access Structure (GAS) and threshold secret sharing scheme in BlockChain as an implementation method for our BC-PDS framework.

DE Permissioned Blockchain; Byzantine Fault Tolerance; Reputation Systems
AB A permissioned blockchain (BC) is a secure distributed ledger maintained by a number of trusted validation nodes. However, a validator may become compromised and send inconsistent messages to different nodes. To counter the problem, consensus protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) can be used. The paper presents a permissioned BC system and discusses various design issues including control messages, block size and window size of block creation time. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify those compromised nodes discovered during the consensus protocol. This paper then proposes a reputation system to track the trustworthiness of nodes as it is necessary to distinguish failed nodes from compromised nodes. A compromised node may send inconsistent messages to others or accuse other nodes compromised, and it should be removed as soon as it is identified and confirmed.

AB Business processes are often related to operational processes, contracts, and regulations. Modeling such processes needs to address regulation monitoring and enforcement, and maintain a reliable history of data for evidence. This paper proposes modeling business processes as smart contracts (SCs) on permissioned blockchains (BCs). The challenges with the proposed approach are state synchronizations among distributed nodes (called authnodes), and real-time requirements. This paper separates the executions of SCs from the state managements on multi-BCs, and proposes a pipeline model to verify and create blocks in parallel.

DE Blockchain; IP Rights; Microfilms
AB Intellectual-property (IP) rights refer to the ownership of intellectual achievement. Microfilms are getting popular nowdue to their low production cost. However, their IP rights are often violated as microfilms can be copied and transmitted via mobile devices easily. This paper proposes using blockchain (BC) to develop an IP-protection model for microfilms. Information registered at a BC cannot be changed without being notified, and this provides an ideal setting for IP protection. This paper proposes a BC-based framework for microfilms in China.

AB Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency currently operating with a total marketcap of almost 7 billion USD. This innovation stands strong on the feature of pseudo anonymity and strives on its innovative de-centralized architecture based on the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger that keeps a public record of all the transactions processed on the bitcoin protocol network in full transparency without revealing the identity of the sender and the receiver. Over the course of 2016, cryptocurrencies have shown some instances of abuse by criminals in their activities due to its interesting nature. Darknet marketplaces are increasing the volume of their businesses in illicit and illegal trades but also cryptocurrencies have been used in cases of extortion, ransom and as part of sophisticated malware modus operandi. We tackle these challenges by developing an analytical capability that allows us to map relationships on the blockchain and filter crime instances in order to investigate the abuse in law enforcement local environment. We propose a practical bitcoin analytical process and an analyzing system that stands alone and manages all data on the blockchain in real-time with tracing and visualizing techniques rendering transactions decipherable and useful for law enforcement investigation and training. Our system adopts combination of analyzing methods that provides statistics of address, graphical transaction relation, discovery of paths and clustering of already known addresses. We evaluated our system in the three criminal cases includes marketplace, ransomware and DDoS extortion. These are practical training in law enforcement, then we determined whether our system could help investigation process and training.

TI Research on a New Signature Scheme on Blockchain
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB With the rise of Bitcoin, blockchain which is the core technology of Bitcoin has received increasing attention. Privacy preserving and performance on blockchain are two research points in academia and business, but there are still some unresolved issues in both respects. An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature that supports making signatures on many different messages generated by many different users. Using aggregate signature, the size of the signature could be shortened by compressing multiple signatures into a single signature. In this paper, a new signature scheme for transactions on blockchain based on the aggregate signature was proposed. It was worth noting that elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and bilinear maps played major roles in our signature scheme. And the security properties of our signature scheme were proved. In our signature scheme, the amount will be hidden especially in the transactions which contain multiple inputs and outputs. Additionally, the size of the signature on transaction is constant regardless of the number of inputs and outputs that the transaction contains, which can improve the performance of signature. Finally, we gave an application scenario for our signature scheme which aims to achieve the transactions of big data on blockchain.

AB Blockchain is attracting more and more attentions from many kinds of fields, such as finance, industry, and theory researchers. Rather than viewing blockchain as a novel technology, we should think it as an innovation for managing digital society, which provides fundamental principles to support democratically distributed applications. Based on the design and application of the Energy Internet, this paper analyzes the core architecture of the initial blockchain technology, and combines the security of the public chain with the efficiency of the private chain, solving the poor efficiency problem of the initial blockchain by using the high efficiency of private chain. At the same time, it inherits the security and non-tampering of initial blockchain. This paper designs a new hybrid blockchain storaging mode that is Block Static Storage(BSS, internal structure is N+X hybrid blockchain, following can be referred to as N+X HBC), for purpose that improving the overall efficiency of the Internet running, achieving decentralized supervision, and provoding a credible, safe and efficient performance of the Energy Internet in the storage of its massive data, as well as a huge business system.

AB Rapid advancement in wearable technology has unlocked a tremendous potential of its applications in the medical domain. Among the challenges in making the technology more useful for medical purposes is the lack of confidence in the data thus generated and communicated. Incentives have led to attacks on such systems. We propose a novel lightweight scheme to securely log the data from bodyworn sensing devices by utilizing neighboring devices as witnesses who store the fingerprints of data in Bloom filters to be later used for forensics. Medical data from each sensor is stored at various locations of the system in chronological epoch-level blocks chained together, similar to the blockchain. Besides secure logging, the scheme offers to secure other contextual information such as localization and timestamping. We prove the effectiveness of the scheme through experimental results. We define performance parameters of our scheme and quantify their cost benefit trade-offs through simulation.

DT Article
DE trusted timestamping; blockchain; digital data protection
AB Decentralized trusted timestamping based on blockchains is used to protect a large variety of digital data. At present, in the case of trusted timestamping services, such related information is not included in the OP_RETURN field of a Bitcoin's transaction chain, which has a limited size (40 bytes). When OP RETURN is extended, (e.g., with multiple OP_RETURN fields) the transaction is rejected by the Bitcoin network. We propose storing data in the blockchain by encoding into Bitcoin addresses. The transactions created by the proposed method are similar to the usual transactions; therefore, they will not be rejected. The proposed method expands the storage space to a maximum of N*20 bytes, thereby enabling the storage of additional information (e.g., file names, creator names, and keywords) as well as file hashes. We performed experiments with a picture and its copyright information. We set N = 3, resulting in storage of 60 bytes of data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can timestamp a file in an average of 24 min at a possible cost of 0.24 USD. We believe that the proposed method can prove the existence and integrity of a digital file, which is helpful in copyright protection.

AB There exist many unsolved problems in the traditional digital rights management of network media. For example, in the traditional management system it is hard to guarantee the quality of media works, to protect the copyrights, to find the effective profit model and so on. To solve these problems, we propose in this paper a network media's digital rights management scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that makes use of cryptographic algorithm, hash chains and consensus mechanism to implement consensus, irreversibility and traceability for online data. The proposed scheme can use these functionalities of blockchain to implement the effective production management, copyright management, transaction management and users' behavior management for network media. Furthermore, our proposed scheme can predictively provide an important support for the network media platform to build a sustainable development of benign ecological environment.

AB Blockchain is a technology of recording ledgers in a distributed manner. It uses a consensus mechanism, digital signature and hash chains to realize the reliable storage of ledgers, and provide services such as traceability, integrity and no-repudiation for transactions in ledgers in a decentralized way. These services make blockchain have great application potentiality in the fields of healthcare, Fintech, computational law and so on. Before wide spreading its applications, blockchain must solve problems such as efficiency and privacy. Among these problems the privacy is an important one. Because blocks on blockchain are open, when transactions in blocks involve privacy data, these data can be leaked. Thus, certain security mechanisms must be built to protect privacy data. The core of these mechanisms is the appropriate key management schemes. However, blockchain is a developing technology, and few studies have been done on key management schemes for it. Because healthcare is a big application scenario of blockchain, in this paper, according to the features of health blockchain, we use body sensor network to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery scheme for keys of health blockchain. Analyses show that the scheme has high security and performance, and it can be used to protect privacy messages on health blockchain effectively and to promote the application of health blockchain.

AB We propose a new secure online storage scheme based on an open P2P network without a central server. In the proposed scheme, attackers cannot detect target user data in the online storage because the user data is divided into some parts by the secret sharing, and they are distributed to P2P nodes via the anonymous communication. The proposed scheme can prevent the direct attack on the target user node because metadata for the reconstruction also hidden in the online storage, hence nothing remains in the user node. Even if the state of the P2P network varies over time between the storing and restoring operation, the proposed scheme ensures that the user can identify the target nodes which stored his metadata by utilizing the Blockchain technology with only memorable secure information for user authentication. Furthermore, a malicious node to attack on others can be detected and ruled out by the mutual monitoring among the nodes and the majority decision rule.

AB Throughout history, currencies or money have three different uses: means of exchange, unit of accounting, and store of wealth. People have used different types of currencies at different times throughout history. Commodity currencies represented items which are either mined from the Earth or produced by agriculture such as gold or salt. Fiat currencies are created by decree by a sovereign nation or groups of nations. Complementary currencies have been created by much smaller groups of people to solve problems which cannot be solved by commodity currencies or fiat currencies. For example, in times of economic depression when people attempt to hoard money (store wealth) there is often not enough currency to accommodate a means of exchange. With the advent of blockchains and crypto-currencies, it is now possible to easily create complementary currencies to attempt to solve problems which can not be solved using commodity currencies or fiat currencies. This paper discusses and compares two different architectures which are being used in two independent projects in South Africa to create complementary currencies by using the Ethereum blockchain and crypto-currency in order to encourage corporate excellence. It is important to note that this paper is not about the underlying success or failure of the complementary currencies created by the architectures. The paper is about the architectures themselves.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralised and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. A major difficulty for architects designing applications based on blockchain is that the technology has many configurations and variants. Since blockchains are at an early stage, there is little product data or reliable technology evaluation available to compare different blockchains. In this paper, we propose how to classify and compare blockchains and blockchain-based systems to assist with the design and assessment of their impact on software architectures. Our taxonomy captures major architectural characteristics of blockchains and the impact of their principal design decisions. This taxonomy is intended to help with important architectural considerations about the performance and quality attributes of blockchain-based systems.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for sharing transactional data and computation without using a central trusted third party. It is an architectural choice to use a blockchain instead of traditional databases or protocols, and this creates trade-offs between non-functional requirements such as performance, cost, and security. However, little is known about predicting the behaviour of blockchain-based systems. This paper shows the feasibility of using architectural performance modelling and simulation tools to predict the latency of blockchain-based systems. We use established tools and techniques, but explore new blockchain-specific issues such as the configuration of the number of confirmation blocks and inter-block times. We report on a lab-based experimental study using an incident management system, showing predictions of median system level response time with a relative error mostly under 10%. We discuss how the approach can be used to support architectural decision-making, during the design of blockchain-based systems.

AB Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet very little has been done to study them for blockchain-based systems. We investigate the cost of using blockchain using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. First, we capture the cost models for both alternatives. Second, we implemented and measured the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for an example business process model from the literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost.

DE Blockchain technology; Virtual currency; Bitcoin
AB The potential of blockchain technology has received attention in the area of FinTech the combination of finance and technology. Blockchain technology was first introduced as the technology behind the Bitcoin decentralized virtual currency, but there is the expectation that its characteristics of accurate and irreversible data transfer in a decentralized P2P network could make other applications possible. Although a precise definition of blockchain technology has not yet been given, it is important to consider how to classify different blockchain systems in order to better understand their potential and limitations. The goal of this paper is to add to the discussion on blockchain technology by proposing a classification based on two dimensions external to the system: (1) existence of an authority (without an authority and under an authority) and (2) incentive to participate in the blockchain (market-based and non-market-based). The combination of these elements results in four types of blockchains. We define these dimensions and describe the characteristics of the blockchain systems belonging to each classification.

   Distributed System
AB Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.

AB Access control face big challenges in IoT. Unfortunately, it is hard to implement current access control standards on smart object due to its constrained nature while the introduction of powerful and trusted third party to handle access control logic could harm user privacy. In this work we show how blockchain, the promising technology behind Bitcoin, can be very attractive to face those arising challenges. We therefore propose FairAccess as a new decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that leverages the consistency of blockchain technology to manage access control on behalf of constrained devices.

AB Volunteering is an indispensable cornerstone of our society, covering nearly every part of our life, from social care to emergency management and education. This omnipresence of volunteering led to a plethora of volunteer management systems (VMS), mainly supporting NPOs in scheduling and allocating tasks to volunteers. In contrast to this NPO-centric approach of existing VMS, we focus on volunteers by investigating the following core question: "How can the engagement of volunteers be digitized and exploited in a life-long way". To provide a first step towards answering this question, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, an in-depth study of related approaches is provided identifying shortcomings but also promising concepts. Second, challenges which have to be tackled to deal with the broad spectrum and peculiarities of volunteering are identified and a vision for a next-generation VMS called iVOLUNTEER is pointed out. Third, promising technologies are identified and discussed in detail to lay the basis for the technical architecture of our envisioned iVOLUNTEER-prototype.

TTP and ACS are the common strategies to reach an agreement of valid application list and operations, however, extra entity should be added into the origin network and the reliability of system rely on the trust operation of third party.
   Consider this network computing model, the directly remote controlled security strategy is lacking for terminal users, while the security of user computing applications are controlled by its resources owner like cloud manager which might be not trusted in whole time. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a consortium blockchain based cleanroom security service protocol (CSSP), to track the deployment and usage of the user's software in a secure and tamper-resistant measure, to prevent running of error or illegal software in user computing environment. Unlike the traditional methods, CSSP is a two side protocol: service provider and user computing node, which reduce the redundant safety hazards nodes and its invalidation problem. Consortium Blockchain is an effectively method to reduce the energy consumption and keep the software service protocol between the manager and the user in safety state. The security analysis and evaluation shows that the approach has major potential in trusted network computing system and provide a higher secure level environment for users.

AB With the development of ICT industry, the volume of produced data is experiencing tremendous growth, which motivates more demands of storage capacity. Because of the limited storage capacity of users' terminals, more and more applications prefer to upload data to cloud platforms. However, it is well known that security should not be neglected in existing cloud storage architectures. Motivated by the increasing popularity of emerging blockchain technology, we propose a blockchain-based security architecture for distributed cloud storage. Moreover, we customize a genetic algorithm to solve the file block replica placement problem between multiple users and multiple data centers in the distributed cloud storage environment. Numerical experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud storage architectures in terms of security, with acceptable network transmission delay.

AB As currently understood and used, "smart contracts" are merely a means to execute the terms of a full legal contract. This paper, however, proposes the creation of a semantic legal layer to support blockchain based legal contracts. Some of the primary challenges to such an implementation, including the need to develop robust, jurisdiction-specific legal ontologies, and develop means to preserve the evidentiary character of records leading up and proving contract formation, are considered. Particular attention is given to the particular challenges posed and purposes behind the use of legal language in contract drafting, with consideration of ways to utilize distributed ledger and linked data technology to leverage that specialist language for a broader base of contracting parties.

AB The purpose of this article is to discuss the application of blockchain technology in e-government, particularly in the Chinese context. Chancheng District, part of Foshan City in Guangdong Province, China, has undertaken a project called "The Comprehensive Experimental Area of Big Data in Guangdong Province" since 2016. Promoting the application of blockchain technology in e-government is an essential part of this undertaking, which is the first use of blockchain in government in China. Taking Chancheng's project as a case study, this article analyzes the framework, difficulties and challenges of applying blockchain to e-government at present, and discusses how blockchain technology can contribute to the development of e-government and public services in China. This article considers the practical realities in China and discusses the application of blockchain technology in Chinese e government, finding that blockchain technology can bring the following benefits: (1) improvements in the quality and quantity of government services, (2) greater transparency and accessibility of government information, (3) development of information-sharing across different organizations, and (4) assistance in building an individual credit system in China. However, information security, cost and reliability are still major problems in application. Thus, establishing a general application platform of blockchain technology and developing management standards are crucial for promoting and applying blockchain in e-government. Blockchain provides an effective way of making government services more efficient, but standardizing the management system, processes and responsibility for the application is necessary for its further promotion. This article, by providing an analysis of the practice of blockchain in e government in China, could serve as a foundation for further practical work and theoretical research in government services.

AB The blockchain constitutes a technology-based, rather than social or regulation based, means to lower uncertainty about one another in order to exchange value. However, its use may very well also lead to increased complexity resulting from having to subsume work that displaced intermediary institutions had performed. We present our perspective that smart contracts may be used to mitigate this increased complexity. We further posit that smart contracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can be verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an inter-organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong in an intra-organizational context. We state that smart contracts that implement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially beneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce inter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may ensure effective evaluation and comparison between different infra organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our perspective by describing Intellichain, which implements formal, agent-based simulation model as a smart contract to provide epidemiological decision support.

AB This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. Blockchain, a decentralized transaction and data management technology, is said to be the technology that will have similar impacts as the Internet had on people's lives. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scalability is an often-cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.

AB Blockchain technology realizes unforgeable and decentralized ledger by applying P2P network, cryptography and consensus mechanism over distributed network. Its security relies on all of these technologies. One of fundamental problem of the security of blockchain technology is compromise of underlying cryptographic algorithms. This paper shows the impact of compromise of underlying cryptography and the way to extend the validity of blockchain applying the long-term signature scheme which was standardized in ETSI. The longterm signature scheme assume the existence of centralized PKI and secure time-stamp service. In this paper, we propose a method to apply similar concept and data structure with de-centralized manner. Our scheme avoids hard-fork of original blockchain, in the case of compromise of hash function and provides smooth-fork in the case of compromise of digital signature scheme.

AB While Bitcoin (Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash) INakl solved the double spend problem and provided work with timestamps on a public ledger, it has not to date extended the functionality of a blockchain beyond a transparent and public payment system. Satoshi Nakamoto's original reference client had a decentralized marketplace service which was later taken out due to a lack of resources IDeval. We continued with Nakamoto's vision by creating a set of commercial-grade services supporting a wide variety of business use cases, including a fully developed blockchain-based decentralized marketplace, secure data storage and transfer, and unique user aliases that link the owner to all services controlled by that alias.

AB Manuscript submission systems are a central fixture in scholarly publishing. However, with existing systems, researchers must trust that their yet unpublished findings will not prematurely be disseminated due to technical weaknesses and that anonymous peer reviewers or committee members will not plagiarize unpublished content. To address this limitation, we present CryptSubmit - a system that automatically creates a decentralized, tamperproof, and publicly verifiable timestamp for each submitted manuscript by utilizing the blockchain of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The publicly accessible and tamperproof infrastructure of the blockchain allows researchers to independently verify the validity of the timestamp associated with their manuscript at the time of submission to a conference or journal. Our system supports researchers in protecting their intellectual property even in the face of vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer reviewers. Optionally, the system also generates trusted timestamps for the feedback shared by peer reviewers to increase the traceability of ideas. CryptSubmit integrates these features into the open source conference management system OJS. In the future, the method could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost into other manuscript submission systems, such as EasyChair, ConfTool, or Ambra. The introduced method can also improve electronic pre-print services and storage systems for research data.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that can be utilized to break ground for secure provenance through the use of a centralized-based application. The method of distributed ledger can serve as the trust machine mechanism to prevent the malicious attacks. This paper introduces a novel service to complement some open-source blockchain protocols. A vital point of adopting blockchain technology is to encourage more and more parties to join for higher security and better efficiency. National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) has initiated a service, named NBCP, for rapidly constructing multiple blockchain nodes around Taiwan. With several pros, users can easily construct private blockchain nodes, catering to the need of developing various prototypes of blockchain-based applications.

AB In the past few years, the number of wireless devices connected to the Internet has increased to a number that could reach billions in the next few years. While cloud computing is being seen as the solution to process this data, security challenges could not be addressed solely with this technology. Security problems will continue to increase with such a model, especially for private and sensitive data such as data personal and medical data collected with more and more sophisticated connected devices (forming the IoT). Thus the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems. The blockchain Technology is a promising approach giving the properties it brings to the field. This paper illustrates an architecture based on blockchain technology, and a protocol for data access, using smart contracts and a publisher-subscriber mechanism.

AB The scientific community is facing a crisis of reproducibility: confidence in scientific results is damaged by concerns regarding the integrity of experimental data and the analyses applied to that data. Experimental integrity can be compromised inadvertently when researchers overlook some important component of their experimental procedure, or intentionally by researchers or malicious third-parties who are biased towards ensuring a specific outcome of an experiment. The scientific community has pushed for "open science" to add transparency to the experimental process, asking researchers to publicly register their data sets and experimental procedures. We argue that the software engineering community can leverage its expertise in tracking traceability and provenance of source code and its related artifacts to simplify data management for scientists. Moreover, by leveraging smart contract and blockchain technologies, we believe that it is possible for such a system to guarantee end-to-end integrity of scientific data and results while supporting collaborative research.

AB Asymmetric cryptography algorithms such as RSA are widely used in applications such as blockchain technology and cloud computing to ensure the security and privacy of data. However, the encryption and decryption operations of asymmetric cryptography algorithms involve many computation-intensive multiplications, which require high memory bandwidth and involve large performance and resource overhead. Emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as racetrack memory are regarded to be promising for all levels of memory hierarchy to reduce the area and power overhead due to their high data density and nearly zero leakage. In this paper, we propose an efficient racetrack memory based in-memory design to accelerate the modular multiplication for asymmetric cryptography algorithms. A novel two-stage scalable modular multiplication algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the delay. An efficient architecture is further developed to reduce the number of required adders by half. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme improves the energy efficiency by 45.9%, the area efficiency by 93.6% and achieves 8x of throughput per area compared with the state-of-the-art CMOS-based implementation.

AB Integrative various distributed generation in energy infrastructure have brought great opportunities in recent years. However, this integration has also led to critical challenges in energy management, such as congestion pricing and non-optimality of dispatch. To address these challenges, deregulation and decentralization of electricity market is one of the effective solutions. Although various deregulation schemes have been proposed in recent years, there still remain some serious challenges in achieving resilient management of real-time energy deregulation especially in the presence of disasters. To counter this issue, in this paper, we propose a model for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactive microgrid where prosumers (Producer/ Consumer) can trade local generation with each other via a smart management system. Furthermore, in our proposed model, the energy trading is executed in a decentralized manner by leveraging Blockchain technologies. Among different Blockchain technologies, we adopt the Ethereum Blockchain in our work. The auction models for energy trading are proposed by incorporating a smart contract that is the essential component of the Blockchain. In our simulations, the proposed P2P energy trading model is evaluated.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated deeply into our lives and the number of IoT devices per person is expected to increase substantially over the next few years. Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes. In order to address these privacy issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT applications based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques. Security, privacy, and numerical analyses are presented to validate the proposed model.

AB Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidencebased medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.

AB The Internet of Things is gaining momentum thanks to the provided vision of seamlessly inter-connected devices. However, a unified way to discover and to interact with the surrounding smart environment is missing. As an outcome, we have been assisting to the development of heterogeneous ecosystems, where each service provider adopts its own protocol-thus preventing IoT devices from interacting when belonging to different providers. And, the same is happening again for the blockchain technology which provides a robust and trusted way to accomplish tasks-unfortunately not providing interoperability thus creating the same heterogeneous ecosystems above highlighted.
   In this context, the fundamental research question we address is how do we find things or services in the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose the first IoT discovery approach which provides an answer to the above question by exploiting hierarchical and universal multi-layered blockchains. Our approach does neither define new standards nor force service providers to change their own protocol. On the contrary, it leverages the existing and publicly available information obtained from each single blockchain to have a better knowledge of the surrounding environment. The proposed approach is detailed and discussed with the support of relevant use cases.

ID INTEGRATIVE MODEL
AB In this paper, we consider the issue of trust and trust-related factors in the context of decentralized applications running on public blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. These decentralized applications emphasize a lack of reliance on a trusted third party, and are marketed as applications that cannot be censored or stopped. To determine whether either social trust or technology trust applies in these cases, we examine the extent to which these applications could be considered to be out of the control of a third party, by qualitatively analyzing how developers define the characteristics of decentralization, trustlessness and autonomy. The results show that although decentralized applications' websites make reference to these concepts, they are not defined in the same way. In cases where there is no mention of either of these concepts, it is therefore difficult to say which definitions are assumed. In addition, we also found contradictions in the characterization of the level of developer control. We discuss these findings in the context of research on user trust and propose future research directions.

AB Transactive energy paradigms will enable the exchange of energy from a distributed set of prosumers. While prosumers have access to distributed energy resources, these resources are intermittently available. There is a need for distributed markets to enable the exchange of energy in transactive environments, however, the large number of potential prosumers introduces challenges in the establishment of trust between prosumers. Markets for transactive environments create other challenges, such as establishing clearing prices for energy and exchanging money between prosumers. Blockchains provide a unique technology to address this distributed trust problem through the use of a distributed ledger, cryptocurrencies, and the execution of smart contracts. This paper introduces a smart contract that implements a transactive energy auction that operates without the need for a trusted entitys oversight. The auction mechanism implements a Vickrey second price auction, which guarantees bidders will submit honest bids. The contract is implemented on transactive agents on the WSU campus interacting with a 72kW PV array and the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is then used to execute auctions based on the energy from the the PV array and simulated building loads to demonstrate the auctions operations.

AB Blockchain was first implemented in Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, with the hash-chained blocks of data, hash-based proof-of-work, and a peer-to-peer protocol to reach consensus so as to append new blocks and secure transactions. Most importantly, it prevents double-spending after some confirmation time. However, few countries accept Bitcoin as a legal currency because, in addition to being subject to some security attacks, there are still problems in economics, politics, performance, etc. Many altcoins with different improvements have been proposed, but problems and attacks still remain. Meanwhile, blockchain, as a trust machine, has been applied to many other areas, such as smart contract, creating a new hype, called "the most significant innovation since the Internet." However, there are still similar problems and attacks in those applications. By changing the original consensus design, instead of just providing proof of work, we propose EPoW, i.e. estimable proof-of-work, to estimate how much work is done and a corresponding protocol to reach consensus. EPoW and the protocol can serve as a new instrument such that the problems and attacks mentioned above might be relaxed or solved economically. With EPoW, we believe blockchains and digital currencies can be better customized by companies, organizations or countries for different purposes or policies and be employed by any users.

AB We present Catena, an efficiently-verifiable Bitcoin witnessing scheme. Catena enables any number of thin clients, such as mobile phones, to efficiently agree on a log of application-specific statements managed by an adversarial server. Catena implements a log as an OP_RETURN transaction chain and prevents forks in the log by leveraging Bitcoin's security against double spends. Specifically, if a log server wants to equivocate it has to double spend a Bitcoin transaction output. Thus, Catena logs are as hard to fork as the Bitcoin blockchain: an adversary without a large fraction of the network's computational power cannot fork Bitcoin and thus cannot fork a Catena log either. However, different from previous Bitcoin-based work, Catena decreases the bandwidth requirements of log auditors from 90 GB to only tens of megabytes. More precisely, our clients only need to download all Bitcoin block headers (currently less than 35 MB) and a small, 600-byte proof for each statement in a block. We implement Catena in Java using the bitcoinj library and use it to extend CONIKS, a recent key transparency scheme, to witness its public-key directory in the Bitcoin blockchain where it can be efficiently verified by auditors. We show that Catena can secure many systems today, such as public-key directories, Tor directory servers and software transparency schemes.

AB Despite a great deal of work to improve the TLS PKI, CA misbehavior continues to occur, resulting in unauthorized certificates that can be used to mount man-in-themiddle attacks against HTTPS sites. CAs lack the incentives to invest in higher security, and the manual effort required to report a rogue certificate deters many from contributing to the security of the TLS PKI. In this paper, we present IKP, a platform that automates responses to unauthorized certificates and provides incentives for CAs to behave correctly and for others to report potentially unauthorized certificates. Domains in IKP specify criteria for their certificates, and CAs specify reactions such as financial penalties that execute in case of unauthorized certificate issuance. By leveraging smart contracts and blockchain-based consensus, we can decentralize IKP while still providing automated incentives. We describe a theoretical model for payment flows and implement IKP in Ethereum to show that decentralizing and automating PKIs with financial incentives is both economically sound and technically viable.

AB We present Catena, an efficiently-verifiable Bitcoin witnessing scheme. Catena enables any number of thin clients, such as mobile phones, to efficiently agree on a log of application-specific statements managed by an adversarial server. Catena implements a log as an OP_RETURN transaction chain and prevents forks in the log by leveraging Bitcoin's security against double spends. Specifically, if a log server wants to equivocate it has to double spend a Bitcoin transaction output. Thus, Catena logs are as hard to fork as the Bitcoin blockchain: an adversary without a large fraction of the network's computational power cannot fork Bitcoin and thus cannot fork a Catena log either. However, different from previous Bitcoin-based work, Catena decreases the bandwidth requirements of log auditors from 90 GB to only tens of megabytes. More precisely, our clients only need to download all Bitcoin block headers (currently less than 35 MB) and a small, 600-byte proof for each statement in a block. We implement Catena in Java using the bitcoinj library and use it to extend CONIKS, a recent key transparency scheme, to witness its public-key directory in the Bitcoin blockchain where it can be efficiently verified by auditors. We show that Catena can secure many systems today, such as public-key directories, Tor directory servers and software transparency schemes.

AB Despite a great deal of work to improve the TLS PKI, CA misbehavior continues to occur, resulting in unauthorized certificates that can be used to mount man-in-the-middle attacks against HTTPS sites. CAs lack the incentives to invest in higher security, and the manual effort required to report a rogue certificate deters many from contributing to the security of the TLS PKI. In this paper, we present IKP, a platform that automates responses to unauthorized certificates and provides incentives for CAs to behave correctly and for others to report potentially unauthorized certificates. Domains in IKP specify criteria for their certificates, and CAs specify reactions such as financial penalties that execute in case of unauthorized certificate issuance. By leveraging smart contracts and blockchain-based consensus, we can decentralize IKP while still providing automated incentives. We describe a theoretical model for payment flows and implement IKP in Ethereum to show that decentralizing and automating PKIs with financial incentives is both economically sound and technically viable.

AB Bitcoin is a new form of global digital currency based on peer-to-peer network, enabling a new payment system, and also a completely decentralised cryptocurrency. The P2P network consists of a digital file listing transactions like a ledger, a copy of which is also maintained on every computer on the network, and the transactions are also broadcasted in the public ledger of the Bitcoin network. Anonymity is the core feature that makes Bitcoin popular among people around the world. This feature is attained through the Bitcoin addresses in the public ledger, which represents the users in the Bitcoin network. Because of the illicit use of Bitcoins, the level of anonymity has reduced even though the users are still using the anonymizers like TOR to keep the anonymity stronger to connect to the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyse the complete process of transaction of Bitcoins and the anonymity thatlies in that process. The study also focuses on finding the forensic artefacts and the investigative way of approach towards the Bitcoin using forensic tools. The forensic tools are used to analyse the web browser activities, local drive, hard disk image, cookies, downloads and session data related to Bitcoins. The attacker can relate the transaction of the users and can control the Bitcoin blocks by even delaying the transactions. This research will focus on the methods in which the memory and even mobile devices involved in the transaction could be captured and analysed.

AB The ever-increasing number of IoT devices necessitates a secure and scalable infrastructure to store and process generated data. Blockchain is an ideal choice with its decentralized, trustless architecture. However, low-power IoT end-devices do not possess enough horsepower to run a software client for intensive blockchain calculations. The purpose of this paper is to create a proof of concept to enable low-power, resource-constrained IoT end-devices accessing a blockchain-based infrastructure. To achieve this aim, an IoT gateway is configured as a blockchain node and an event-based messaging mechanism for low-power IoT end-devices is proposed. A demonstration of such a system is realized using LoRa nodes and gateway in a private Ethereum network.

AB Mobile Financial Services (MFS) represent an area of innovation and strategic importance for global initiatives against poverty, and telcos; the World Bank wants financial inclusion of the poor and telcos seek profit. Merely mobile payment services are not sufficient for any of these objectives, and there is a joint interest in enabling mobile credit and saving services. It is widely recognized that successful adoption of mobile saving and credit services is dependent on a digital solution; it requires a transition from current cash based over-the-counter (OTC) solutions to future digital accounts (mobile wallets/mWallets). Firstly, this paper reviews previous research on MFS, secondly it summarizes the global industry picture for MFS today, and thirdly, we provide key learnings from the successful Easypaisa case in Pakistan. MFS can also be characterized as implementations in complex ecosystems with lots of tension and dependent on local circumstances. The unique Easypasia case we present is a further proof of the complex processes and events that moves a MFS implementation from one state to another. It also shows how Easypaisa's significant jump from cash-based to digital mWallet solutions was triggered by a governmental regulation on ID requirements for mobile subscriptions. The ecosystem approach and significance of local conditions is vital to be aware of when the industry turns to new aspects of MFS and when technologies such as blockchain may disrupt the current situation.

AB The blockchain is a perceptive invention - the discovery of a person or group of people. But since its invention, it has evolved into something greater and present opportunities for tempestuous innovation. Blockchain has tried to allure evreryone across different domains like industrial sector, banking, healthcare, land holdings and even the public and private sector. The blockchain is an imperishable digital log of financial transactions that can be scheduled to record not just efficient transactions but practically everything that holds a price. It enables global business transactions with less conflict and more trust. Blockchain has invented an era into technology in which the digital information can be distributed without being imitated. Bitcoin blockchain is the most popular public blockchain network, with around 10K nodes. The other big cryptocurrency blockchain project is Ethereum. Ethereum however wasn't designed to be a form of currency but instead it is intended to enable "smart contracts". Many cryptocurrencies are built on the top of blockchain, with the most popular being Bitcoin. In this paper we are going to present an overview of the blockchain technology with focus on two most widely used cryptocurrencies and their comparative analysis.

AB Achieving efficient and secure resource discovery in the intercloud remains non-trivial. Several peer-to-peer based resource discovery schemes have been proposed by researchers apart from industry bodies such as the Global Inter Cloud Technology Forum (GICTF). The challenges with these distributed schemes include peer-selection, trust/reputation management, transaction record management and financial settlements besides handling failures. We propose a P2P-based resource discovery framework using blockchain which addresses several of the key shortcomings of existing approaches. The proposed framework scores over existing schemes on several functional and performance parameters. It is the first instance of applying the blockchain concept to the intercloud resource discovery process circumventing the need of a trusted third-party or broker between participating Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency based on cryptographic algorithms. All the transactions of this currency are recorded and stored in a publically available database called blockchain. Since, these transactions are available to everyone, bitcoins must be stored in a secured wallet. These bitcoin wallets can be opened only by its secret key. And if once the secret key of the wallet is lost, it cannot be recovered because of the irreversible nature of bitcoin transaction. To root out this problem, Goldfeder et al. [4] proposed a solution of threshold signature scheme compatible with bitcoins signature by using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) providing security policy of shared control of a wallet in which each player gets only a single share. Considering an important point of priority/weightage of players, Dikshit and Singh [12] first proposed a scheme in which each player is given one or more shares of the secret key according to his weightage/priority. This scheme has a drawback of managing and handling many keys by each player. Suppose a player has weightage w, then he possesses w different shares of secret key. This problem is resolved in the proposed scheme in this paper. We propose a scheme in which all the players get single share and can accomplish the requirements of concept of weightage. We extend the weighted threshold ECDSA scheme in order to realize efficient weighted threshold ECDSA scheme.

AB In this work, we propose a blockchain verification protocol as a method for enabling and securing spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The spectrum-sharing mechanism is used as a medium access protocol for accessing wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. We introduce a virtual currency, called "Specoins", for payment to access spectrum. An auction mechanism based on a first-come-first-served queue is used, with the price for the spectrum advertised by each primary user in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain protocol facilitates the transactions between primary and secondary users, and is used to validate and save each user's virtual wallet. The blockchain also serves as a distributed database that is visible by all participating parties and any node can volunteer to update the blockchain. The volunteer nodes are called miners and they are awarded with Specoins. We propose diverse methods to exchange the Specoins in order to make leasing possible even by cognitive radios that are not miners. We show the improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional Aloha medium access protocol in terms of spectrum usage.

AB Why is the educational industry so slow in adopting crowd content opportunities? This contrasts with transaction streams observed in other industries such as advertising, music, encyclopedias and travel. To answer this question, and informed by a literature review, we develop a model of transaction streams in the MOOCs industry and prove that MOOCs pricing, optimal design and best-price search are NP-complete problems. The proof suggests computational complexity is what prevents aggregation services and provides additional insights into what should be pricing policies that foster transaction streams in digital learning. In particular, it suggests three business models to develop the full value creation potential of transaction streams in education: first, one open to aggregation at no cost (very open or open source software model); second a model centrally controlled by one academic institution (flat fee or Spotify model); finally, we propose a class of simplified pricing models (and introduce on of them, MOOCIX) to enable a third route (legal programming or blockchain model) that would enable business models with financial sustainability for the MOOC industry by creating a blockchain-based "Internet of Value" around the learning industry. We contend existing models such as Open Courseware and CCX are timid approaches that do not fall in any of the three categories above and, thus cannot explode because of computational complexity constraints. To overcome these hurdles we recommend Open Courseware, for example, could change its licensing to allow for-profit revenue from improvements (i.e. a-la-GNU-GPLx), and CCX could evolve into a Spotify-type "flat" model. We conclude reviewing briefly possible avenues of future research.

AB Up2U its a recent European project that focuses on a specific learning context and very formative period represented by secondary schools that in most European countries provide education to secondary students.
   The aim is to develop an innovative 'solution based on a ecosystem that facilitates more open, effective and efficient co-design, co-creation and use of digital content, tools and services specially adapted for personalized, collaborative or experimental learning for students preparing for university.
   The project entails the provision of educational applications, project-based and peer-to-peer learning scenarios and the facilitation of international interaction for secondary schools in Europe.
   We believe on creative teachers that will be placed on the process to encouraged others to provide and innovative experience to others and expect their inputs and ideas for implementation.
   We are inspired by organic educational initiatives, such as Google for Education, Khan Academy and the like, Up2U creates a flipped virtual ecosystem where students can learn at their own pace supported by social interactions, federated access and are able to exchange documents and other project-related multimedia content in a trusted and privacy-protected environment.
   The initial phase of Up2U will focus on the adoption and customization of a learning management system that will implement basic functionalities and standard Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) interfaces.
   During the first year the new platform is expected to create an environment for creative student projects across Europe whose results will be shared with other schools and made publicly available. Personalized learning analytic's, peer reviews and community-driven digital recognition systems - using Open Badges and block chain technology - will also be investigated.
   Some educational experiences will be performed with some groups of teachers from some schools on the pilot countries. Teachers will be encouraged to change the process and promote distributed learning initiatives as, for example, lecture recordings, and learning activities mediated by technology.

AB A blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger, a disruptive technology that creates new possibilities for digital ecosystems. The blockchain ecosystem maintains an immutable transaction record to support many types of digital services. This paper compares the performance and scalability of a web-based groupware communication application using both non-blockchain and blockchain technologies. Scalability is measured where message load is synthesized over two typical communication topologies. The first is 1 to n network - a typical client-server or star-topology with a central vertex (server) receiving all messages from the remaining n - 1 vertices (clients). The second is a more naturally occurring scale-free network topology, where multiple communication hubs are distributed throughout the network. System performance is tested with both blockchain and non-blockchain solutions using multiple cloud computing configurations. We analyze the empirical results from each configuration to identify the costs and overhead of blockchain technology.

DE Bitcoin; Lightning Network; audit trail
AB The limited size of a block in the Bitcoin blockchain produces a scaling bottleneck. The transaction scalability problem can be addressed by performing smaller transactions off-chain and periodically reporting the results to the Bitcoin blockchain. One such solution is the Lightning Network.
   Bitcoin is employed by lawful users and criminals. This requires crimes against lawful users as well as the use of Bitcoin for nefarious purposes to be investigated. However, unlike Bitcoin, the Lightning Network enables collusion attacks involving intermediate nodes and recipients. In such an attack, regardless of a sender's actions, money is received by an intermediate node that colludes with a dishonest recipient. Since the dishonest recipient does not "actually" receive the money, it does not provide the goods/service to the sender. Thus, the sender pays for the unprovided goods/service, but the recipient can prove that the payment was not received.
   This chapter discusses the forensic implications of collusion attacks with regard to lawful users because no discernible traces of attacks remain, as well as for law enforcement, where the attacks can target parties as a form of forfeiture, analogous to law enforcement "sting" operations. This chapter also discusses the potential of the Lightning Network to be used for money laundering activities.

DE TLS Handshake Protocol; Certificate transparency; Ethereum blockchain;
   Smart contract; Game Theory
AB Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the main standard designed for secure connections over the Internet. Security of TLS connections against active Man-in-the-Middle attacks relies on correctly validating public-key certificates during TLS handshake authentication. Although Certificate Transparency (CT) and further improved CT system-IKP mitigated the certificate authentication issues from the perspective of monitoring CA misbehavior, less attentions have been paid to consider the misbehavior of domain in using certificates during TLS handshake authentication. One misusing case is that domains refuse to use the certificates in Certificate Transparency Log for their own profits, the other is that a malicious domain impersonates the real one to deceive clients. In order to defend against domain's misbehaviors in using certificates, we propose ETDA system based on IKP and CT aiming to enhance the security of TLS protocol from a novel perspective. ETDA is a blockchain-based system enforcing the automatic punishments in response to domain misbehavior and compensations to the client during TLS handshake authentication. The decentralized nature and incentives mechanism of ETDA provide an effective approach to prevent domains from sending invalid certificates to clients. We implement this system through Ethereum platform and Game Theory, which proved to be both technically and economically feasible.

DE Bitcoin; cryptocurrencies; blockchain protocols; consensus problems
AB As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin [1] has ignited much excitement, not only for its novel realization of a central bank-free financial instrument, but also as an alternative approach to classical distributed computing problems, such as reaching agreement distributedly in the presence of misbehaving parties, as well as to numerous other applications. contracts, reputation systems, name services, etc. The soundness and security of these applications, however, hinges on the thorough understanding of the fundamental properties of its underlying blockchain data structure, which parties ("miners") maintain and try to extend by generating "proofs of work" (POW, aka "cryptographic puzzle").
   In this talk we follow the approach introduced in [2], formulating such fundamental properties of the blockchain, and then showing how applications such as consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built "on top'' of them. The properties are as follows, assuming the adversary's hashing power (our analysis holds against arbitrary attacks) is strictly less than 1/2 and high network synchrony:
   Common prefix: The blockchains maintained by the honest parties possess a large common prefix. More specifically, if two honest parties "prune" (i.e., cut off) k blocks from the end of their local chains, the probability that the resulting pruned chains will not be mutual prefixes of each other drops exponentially in the that parameter.
   Chain quality: We show a bound on the ratio of blocks in the chain of any honest party contributed by malicious parties. In particular, as the adversary's hashing power approaches 1/2, we show that blockchains are only guaranteed to have few, but still some, blocks contributed by honest parties.
   Chain growth: We quantify the number of blocks that are added to the blockchain during any given number of rounds during the execution of the protocol. (N.B.: This property, which in [2] was proven and used directly in the form of a lemma, was explicitly introduced in [3]. Identifying it as a separate property enables modular proofs of applications' properties.)
   The above properties hold assuming that all parties. honest and adversarial-"wake up" and start computing at the same time, or, alternatively, that they compute on a common random string (the "genesis" block) only made available at the exact time when the protocol execution is to begin. In this talk we also consider the question of whether such a trusted setup/behavioral assumption is necessary, answering it in the negative by presenting a Bitcoinlike blockchain protocol that is provably secure without trusted setup, and, further, overcomes such lack in a scalable way. i.e., with running time independent of the number of parties [4].
   A direct consequence of our construction above is that consensus can be solved directly by a blockchain protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power).

   System architecture
AB Current blockchain platforms, especially the recent permissioned systems, have architectural limitations: smart contracts run sequentially, all node executes all smart contracts, consensus protocols are hard-coded, the trust model is static and not flexible, and non-determinism in smart-contract execution poses serious problems. Overcoming these limitations is critical for improving both functional properties of blockchains, such as confidentiality and consistency, as well as their non-functional properties, such as performance and scalability.
   We discuss these limitations in the context of permissioned blockchains, including an early version of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform, and how a re-design of Hyperledger Fabric's architecture addresses them.

DE Scalability; privacy; Private Blockchain; Hyperledger
AB The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool that has the potential to positively impact the way we design a number of online applications today. In many ways, the blockchain technology is, however, still not mature enough to cater for industrial standards. Namely, existing Byzantine tolerant permission-based blockchain deployments can only scale to a limited number of nodes. These systems typically require that all transactions (and their order of execution) are publicly available to all nodes in the system, which comes at odds with common data sharing practices in the industry, and prevents a centralized regulator from overseeing the full blockchain system.
   In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture devised specifically to meet industrial standards. Our proposal leverages the notion of satellite chains that can privately run different consensus protocols in parallel-thereby considerably boosting the scalability premises of the system. Our solution also accounts for a "hands-off" regulator that oversees the entire network, enforces specific policies by means of smart contracts, etc. We implemented our solution and integrated it with Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 [2].

AB Blockchain is a novel way to construct fully distributed systems and has the potential to disrupt many businesses including Uber and Airbnb within the sharing economy. Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.

DE blockchain; anonymization; privacy
AB User privacy is an important issue in a blockchain based transaction system. Bitcoin, being one of the most widely used blockchain based transaction system, fails to provide enough protection on users' privacy. Many subsequent studies focus on establishing a system that hides the linkage between the identities (pseudonyms) of users and the transactions they carry out in order to provide a high level of anonymity. Examples include Zerocoin, Zerocash and so on. It thus becomes an interesting question whether such new transaction systems do provide enough protection on users' privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for de-anonymizing these transaction systems by leveraging information in the system that is not directly related, including the number of transactions made by each identity and time stamp of sending and receiving. Combining probability studies with optimization tools, we establish a model which allows us to determine, among all possible ways of linking between transactions and identities, the one that is most likely to be true. Subsequent transaction graph analysis could then be carried out, leading to the de-anonymization of the system. To solve the model, we provide exact algorithms based on mixed integer linear programming.
   Our research also establishes interesting relationships between the de-anonymization problem and other problems studied in the literature of theoretical computer science, e.g., the graph matching problem and scheduling problem.

DE Double Financing; distributed trust; blockchain
AB Factoring is an important financial instrument for SMEs to solve liquidity problems, where the invoice is cashed to avoid late buyer payments. Unfortunately, this business model is risky as it relies on human interaction and involved actors (factors in particular) suffer from information asymmetry. One of the risks involved is 'double-financing': the event that an SME extracts funds from multiple factors. To reduce this asymmetry and increase the scalability of this important instrument, we propose a framework, DecReg, based on blockchain technology. We provide the protocols designed for this framework and present performance analysis. This framework will be deployed in practice as of February 2017 in the Netherlands.

AB The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in use today on the Internet to secure communications has several drawbacks arising from its centralised and non-transparent design. In the past there has been instances of certificate authorities publishing rogue certificates for targeted attacks, and this has been difficult to immediately detect as certificate authorities are not transparent about the certificates they issue. Furthermore, the centralised selection of trusted certificate authorities by operating system and browser vendors means that it is not practical to untrust certificate authorities that have issued rogue certificates, as this would disrupt the TLS process for many other hosts.
   SCPKI is an alternative PKI system based on a decentralised and transparent design using a web-of-trust model and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, to make it easily possible for rogue certificates to be detected when they are published. The web-of-trust model is designed such that an entity or authority in the system can verify (or vouch for) fine-grained attributes of another entity's identity (such as company name or domain name), as an alternative to the centralised certificate authority identity verification model.

DE Built Environment; Syndication; Microservices; Federation
AB Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms which restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.

DE SALT; Blockchain; Decentralized; ACID; BASE; Transaction Processing
AB Traditional ACID transactions, typically supported by relational database management systems, emphasize database consistency. BASE provides a model that trades some consistency for availability, and is typically favored by cloud systems and NoSQL data stores. With the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, another alternative to both ACID and BASE is introduced: SALT. In this keynote paper, we present SALT as a model to explain blockchains and their use in application architecture. We take both, a transaction and a transaction processing systems perspective on the SALT model. From a transactions perspective, SALT is about Sequential, Agreed-on, Ledgered, and Tamper-resistant transaction processing. From a systems perspective, SALT is about decentralized transaction processing systems being Symmetric, Admin-free, Ledgered and Time-consensual. We discuss the importance of these dual perspectives, both, when comparing SALT with ACID and BASE, and when engineering blockchain-based applications. We expect the next-generation of decentralized transactional applications to leverage combinations of all three transaction models.

AB Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols have been actively researched for the past five years. PoS finds direct applicability in open blockchain platforms and has been seen as a strong candidate to replace the largely inefficient Proof of Work mechanism that is currently plugged in most existing open blockchains. Although a number of PoS variants have been proposed, these protocols suffer from a number of security shortcomings; for instance, most existing PoS variants suffer from the nothing at stake and the long range attacks which considerably degrade security in the blockchain.
   In this paper, we address these problems and we propose two PoS protocols that allow validators to generate at most one block at any given "height"-thus alleviating the problem of nothing at stake and preventing attackers from compromising accounts to mount long range attacks. Our first protocol leverages a dedicated digital signature scheme that reveals the identity of the validator if the validator attempts to work on multiple blocks at the same height. On the other hand, our second protocol leverages existing pervasive Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to limit the block generation requests by any given validator to a maximum of one at a given height. We analyze the security of our proposals and evaluate their performance by means of implementation; our evaluation results show that our proposals introduce tolerable overhead in the block generation and validation process when compared to existing PoS protocols.

AB We present atomic trade protocols for Bitcoin and Ethereum that can bind two parties to swap coins in the event that two blockchains emerge from a single "pre-fork" blockchain. This work is motivated by a bet between two members of the Bitcoin community, Loaded and Roger Ver, to trade 60,000 bitcoins in the event that Bitcoin Unlimited's planned hardfork occurs and the blockchain splits into two distinct forks. Additionally we study several ways to provide replay protection in the event of hardfork alongside a novel mechanism called migration inputs. We provide a detailed survey and history of previous softforks and hardforks in Ethereum and Bitcoin.

AB Program code stored on the Ethereum blockchain is considered immutable, but this does not imply that its control flow cannot be modified. This bears the risk of loopholes whenever parties encode binding agreements in smart contracts. In order to quantify the issue, we define a heuristic indicator of control flow immutability, evaluate it based on a call graph of all smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, and find that two out of five smart contracts require trust in at least one third party. Besides, the analysis reveals that significant parts of the Ethereum blockchain are interspersed with debris from past attacks against the platform. We leverage the call graph to develop a method for data cleanup, which allows for less biased statistics of Ethereum use in practice.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a ledger (or "blockchain") to keep track of the transactions made between its users. Because it is a fully decentralized system and anyone can join, every transaction is by necessity public. Thus, to preserve some semblance of privacy, users in the system are represented not by their real-world identities but by pseudonyms. While pseudonyms are acceptable for a standalone cryptocurrency, the emergence of other potential blockchain-based applications - e.g., using them to administer benefits and pensions - poses a need to associate certain attributes with the users of the system. In this paper, we address the question of how to register identities and attributes in a system built on globally visible ledgers. We propose a variety of possible solutions and in each case, we analyze the tradeoff our solution provides between privacy (ensuring that no one can associate the user's real-world identity with the pseudonym or other attributes they use on the ledger), usability (ensuring that verification of their attributes poses the lowest possible burden to users), and integrity (ensuring that no one can impersonate a user). We also present an implementation of one of our solution using Ethereum.

Moreover, we take advantage of Bitcoin's decentralized nature to facilitate a shared control between users and identity providers, allowing users to directly manage their own identities, fluidly coordinating identities from different providers, even as identity providers can revoke identities and impose controls.

AB The Bitcoin whitepaper [1] states that security of the system is guaranteed as long as honest miners control more than half of the current total computational power. The whitepaper assumes a static difficulty, thus it is equally hard to solve a cryptographic proof-of-work puzzle for any given moment of system history. However, the real Bitcoin network is using an adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism.
   In this paper we introduce and analyze a new kind of attack on the mining difficulty retargeting function used in Bitcoin which we call "coin-hopping". In a coin-hopping attack, a malicious miner increases his mining profits while at the same time increasing the average delay between blocks.
   We propose an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm in order to reduce the incentive to perform a coin-hopping attack, and also decrease inter-block delays. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach and show how its novel algorithm performs better than the original algorithm of Bitcoin.

AB Concert tickets "are" nowadays unique identifiers that are printed on paper as barcodes, and scanned at the entrance gate. While this system is convenient and secure for the concert organizer, it bears risks and inconveniences for the ticket owner.
   We developed a prototype system in which concert tickets are managed as assets on a blockchain. The system prevents ticket theft as well as fraud such as selling invalid tickets, or selling multiple copies of a ticket, by leveraging the consistency features of the blockchain.
   We implemented the system based on Hyperledger Fabric V1. We developed a smart contract that manages the tickets as assets on the blockchain. We also developed a client application that runs on a smart phone and allows to seamlessly transfer tickets between two users using their phones, as well as the control at the entrance gate.

AB New digital technologies such as Blockchain and smart contracting are rapidly changing the face of value exchange, and present exciting new opportunities for designers. This one-day workshop will explore the implications of emerging and future technologies using the lens of Distributed Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). DAOs introduce the principle that products and services may soon be owned and managed collectively and not by one person or authority, thus challenging traditional concepts of user communities, ownership and power. The HCI community has recently explored issues related to finance, money and collaborative practice; however, the implications of these emerging but rapidly ascending distributed organisations has not been examined. This one-day participatory workshop will combine presentations, case studies and group work sessions to understand, develop and critique these new forms of distributed power and ownership, and to practically explore how to design interactive products and services which enable, challenge or disrupt these emerging models.

AB Complexity of electric/electronics (E/E) in automobiles increases tremendously due to more connectivity and real-time data processing. Hence, huge volatility of E/E artifacts is the consequence. In order to keep track of all changes made from early systems engineering to late after sales, a permeable traceability in data management systems has to be achieved. Therefore, this elaboration adapts the blockchain technology to achieve traceability of E/E development artifacts from early model-based systems engineering (MBSE) till after sales. By this, MBSE is linked to product data management and the automobile's configuration is known at each instant of time. The Digital Twin, a digital, domain-specific representation of the physical vehicle in one front end tool, makes the complexity still feasible to handle and is empowered by the blockchain. Hence, traceability of E/E artifacts over an automobile's lifecycle including MBSE is fostered in a manageable manner.

AB Bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies employ a consensus protocol called Nakamoto consensus which rewards miners for maintaining a public blockchain. In this paper, we study the security of this protocol with respect to rational miners and show how a minority of the computation power can incentivize the rest of the network to accept a blockchain of the minority's choice. By deviating from the mining protocol, a mining pool which controls at least 38.2% of the network's total computational power can, with modest financial capacity, gain mining advantage over honest mining. Such an attack creates a longer valid blockchain by forking the honest blockchain, and the attacker's blockchain need not disrupt any "legitimate" non-mining transactions present on the honest blockchain. By subverting the consensus protocol, the attacking pool can double-spend money or simply create a blockchain that pays mining rewards to the attacker's pool. We show that our attacks are easy to encode in any Nakamoto-consensus-based cryptocurrency which supports a scripting language that is sufficiently expressive to encode its own mining puzzles.

DE Bitcoin; blockchain
AB The aim of this article is to analyze possible areas of use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency systems. The emergence of this technology is linked to the emergence of the Bitcoin system in 2008. Blockchain is a special type of a database, into which are chronologically recorded the transactions, which are executed in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In this article, we will examine three areas of use. The first is the possibility of replacing the conventional "fiat" money with cryptocurrencies. The second area is to use cryptocurrencies as a store of value. The latest area of interest is the use of blockchain technology as a very secure and effective form of transaction records, with potential for use in various, even non-financial, areas.

AB The IoT is pervading our daily activities and lives with devices scattered all over our cities, transport systems, buildings, homes and bodies. This invasion of devices with sensors and communication capabilities brings big concerns, mainly about the privacy and confidentiality of the collected information. These concerns hinder the wide adoption of the IoT. To overcome them, in this work, we present an Blockchain-based architecture for IoT access authorizations. Following the IoT tendency requirements, our architecture is user transparent, user friendly, fully decentralized, scalable, fault tolerant and compatible with a wide range of today's access control models used in the IoT. Finally, our architecture also has a secure way to establish relationships between users, devices and group of both, allowing the assignment of attributes for these relationships and their use in the access control authorization.

AB This article examines contract as a focal point of modern society both in terms of the way that it is used to classify relationships and the way in which it is used to order relationships. I look at how contractual structures and relationships across a variety of speciman scenarios (private sector supply contracts and public service delivery contracts) can be explained using the work of Ian Macneil. He gives us an account of how the socialising contexts of contract relationships evolve and change. Smart contracts offer a new way of constructing relationships. Their advocates suggest that they have the potential to revolutionise the practice of exchange. I consider smart contracts from Macneil's perspective and work through whether his account of relationality will be able to encompass this new practise.

DE Consensus; Blockchain; Liquidation system
AB Blockchain serving as an unalterable ledger, has received widespread attentions recently, which allows carrying out transactions with a decentralized matter. Applications with blockchain technology are springing up. However, financial applications especially in bank liquidation system are still facing big challenges. This paper first presents a consensus combined delegated-proof-of-stake protocol and BFT algorithm together. At the same time, using parallel idea and redesigned blockchain structure make the system more efficiency.

AB Sites for online classified ads selling sex are widely used by human traffickers to support their pernicious business. The sheer quantity of ads makes manual exploration and analysis unscalable. In addition, discerning whether an ad is advertising a trafficked victim or an independent sex worker is a very difficult task. Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads definitively known to be posted by a trafficker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Specifically, we develop a machine learning classifier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. different authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially find human traffickers.

TI What Diplomacy in the Ancient Near East Can Tell Us About Blockchain
   Technology
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
ID SIGNALING THEORY
AB A blockchain is an institutional technology-a protocol-that allows for economic coordination between agents separated by boundaries of possible mistrust. Blockchains are not the only technology in history to have these characteristics. The paper looks at the role of the diplomatic protocol at the very beginning of human civilisation in the ancient near east. These two protocols-diplomatic and blockchain-have significant similarities. They were created to address to similar economic problems using similar mechanisms: a permanent record of past dealings, public and ritualistic verification of transactions, and game-theoretic mechanisms of reciprocity. The development of the diplomatic protocol allowed for the creation of the first international community and facilitated patterns of peaceful trade and exchange. Some questions about a generalised 'protocol economics' are drawn.

AB Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain systems have evolved immensely in terms of performance and usability. There is a massive focus on building enterprise blockchain solutions, with providers such as IBM and Microsoft already providing Blockchainas-a Service (BaaS). To facilitate the adoption of blockchain technologies across various business verticals, we argue that middleware plays an integral role in accelerating the development of automated business processes (i.e., smart contracts). We argue that decentralized messaging is a key requirement of many distributed applications and should be provided as a reusable blockchain middle-ware. Our system, called HyperPubSub, provides decentralized publish/subscribe messaging for a multi-federated, permissioned, environment. HyperPubSub provides secure and privacy-preserving messaging, which is audited using blockchains for validation and monetization purposes. We demonstrate our implementation using Kafka and Hyperledger.

AB Following the success of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger, blockchains are now gaining widespread adoption in a wide variety of applications, using a diversity of distributed ledger systems with varying characteristics. Yet, beyond the original bitcoin protocol, the safety and reliability properties of such systems are not sufficiently analyzed. To better understand the behavior of these systems, we propose VIBES: a configurable blockchain simulator for large scale peer-to-peer networks. With VIBES, users can explore important characteristics and metrics of the network, reason about interactions between nodes, and compare different scenarios in an intuitive way. VIBES differentiates itself from previous works in its ability to simulate blockchain systems beyond bitcoin and its support for large-scale simulations with thousands of nodes.

AB Blockchain is one of the hottest topics in the discussion of technologies lately. As the enabling technology for Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, blockchain is an append only distributed ledger that is virtually impossible to attack given sufficient scale of participants. Hence, blockchain holds great promises as the fundamental technology to enable Internet-based electronic voting. However, Internet-based voting has additional requirements than monetary transactions. In this paper, we analyze these requirements, review existing proposed solutions, and outline possible improvements. Specifically, we propose to use live biometrics of the voter to perform secure and highly reliable remote authentication. We also propose a scheme to protect the secrecy of the ballots and eliminate the influence of votes already cast. Finally, we propose to impose a hierarchy to the voting infrastructure that aligns naturally with traditional voting, which enables parallel processing of multiple blockchains, to overcome the intrinsic scalability limitation of the blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain technology is becoming widely used in various areas. While we wanted to gain experience with blockchain technology, we felt that the best way to do that would be to redevelop a project that we were familiar with. A project of this nature needed to be something we had developed that would use the interesting capabilities of blockchain technology and yet would be small enough to be accomplished fairly easily. To this end we chose a homework submission system that we routinely use for our classes. While this project was perhaps not the best fit for the blockchain technology, it none-the-less exercised all the capabilities that we found interesting in a way that made sense from a blockchain point of view. Our experiences have expanded the list of potential problems for which blockchain might be appropriate.

AB The Intelligent vehicle (IV) is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from many security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication. The major issues in IV communication are trust, data accuracy and reliability of communication data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Communication. In this paper, we introduce an Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. The IVs comm unicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed IV-TP. This IV-TP mechanism introduced in the paper provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. The introduced reward-based system is an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication.

AB For the sake of protecting users' privacy from the malicious data which is shared by other people and leasing the pressure of the clouds, an approach of verification based on the Blockchain is put forward in our article. By using the Blockchain to record the hash value and other necessary information of data sharing by other people, we can guarantee that the data user received from a third-party source (such as a cloud storage platform) is the original uploaded data indeed. After taking some experiments on the following method. We confirm that it can be easily distinguished whether a data has been modified by malicious people through our Blockchain-based approach. This Blockchain-based approach of verification can effectively help users find out if the data received is the one exactly he wants. In addition, our approach will imply that the data is not the original one and that data cannot be opened or executed.

AB Blockchain is a technology that is based on Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It is a technology for decentralizing transaction and managing data. Immense research and deep thinking has gone into conceptualizing blockchain since the time it was first showcased by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The growing interest among researchers and technologists is the central attribute of blockchain that provides a high level of security, anonymity and data integrity without any intervention from third party who is in control of the transactions. Here in this study we have carried out through a well-defined study with the sole aim of collecting all relevant research areas and technologies on Blockchain Technology. With Blockchain becoming future in transactions in financial sector, it also comes with its own burden of risks. But since it has the potential to revolutionize the existing technology, it feels right to take the plunge[1].

AB As a decentralized and distributed secure storage technology, the notion of blockchain is now widely used for electronic trading in finance, for issuing digital certificates, for copyrights management, and for many other security-critical applications. With applications in so many domains with high-assurance requirements, the formalization and verification of safety and security properties of blockchain becomes essential, and the aim of the present paper. We present the model-based formalization, simulation and verification of a blockchain protocol by using the SDL formalism of Telelogic Tau. We consider the hierarchical and modular SDL model of the blockchain protocol and exercise a methodology to formally simulate and verify it. This way, we show how to effectively increase the security and safety of blockchain in order to meet high assurance requirements demanded by its application domains. Our work also provides effective support for assessing different network consensus algorithms, which are key components in blockchain protocols, as well as on the topology of blockchain networks. In conclusion, our approach contributes to setting up a verification methodology for future blockchain standards in digital trading.

DE Bitcoin; Visual Analytics; Analysis Tool
AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a peer-to-peer payment system, where transactions directly take place between pseudo-anonymous users, without any centralised authority. Since the block-chain (i.e., the public ledger where transactions are registered) is an example of Big Data, a straightforward visualisation is not very informative. For this reason, we employ techniques from Visual Analytics to filter out undesired information in order to obtain a tool to visually analyse the transactions and help its analysis. For instance, different views can highlight miners, or sources and leaves of bitcoin flows, together with the balance of each address and transaction. Moreover, the main view sees transactions as grouped into disconnected "islands", making it possible to focus on only one of them at once.

DE supply chains; blockchain; semantic matchmaking; object discovery
AB Supply chains can be seen as cyber-physical networks grounded on object identification and tracking. Conventional trust models featuring centralized information management architectures and simplistic things classification lend two of the most relevant limitations to current solutions. Blockchain introduces novel and a valuable trust approaches while semantic technologies better permit a things description. This paper introduces a semantic-enhanced blockchain platform allowing a flexible object discovery. It is based on validation by consensus of smart contracts and adopt a semantic matchmaking between queries and object annotations expressed w.r.t. ontology models. Early experiments assess the good behaviour of the proposed framework.

AB Current trade is being heavily influenced by emerging technologies. Despite many technological advances, logistics management is at a standstill about the improvements communication systems. Updating information during the whole process is an essential element in such systems but trust in that information is even more important. For this reason, providing a mechanism that can be verified and that allows increasing the level of trust of the stakeholders could contribute to the improvement of the logistic process. The main aim of this paper is to show an analysis of the current state of blockchain technology and its possibilities regarding the development of decentralized and self-verifiable applications focusing on their integrity. Besides, a new concept of program is defined thanks to the use of a set of smart contracts which should be deployed over the Ethereum blockchain.

AB in the year 2009, a new virtual currency called Bitcoin was introduced to the world. Bitcoin generation and transactions are based on hashes and asymmetric encryption algorithms. Bitcoin is the first attempt at creating a decentralized virtual currency with no central bank or financial entity controlling it and is very attractive to different demographies of users. A lot of misunderstanding and doubt surrounds Bitcoin. Based on studying the few years of Bitcoin's circulation and usage, we presented the strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin and analyzed what opportunities and threats it faces in the current financial environment. We summarized the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Bitcoin in an SWOT analysis. We concluded that the most important factors to influence the future of Bitcoin circulation and price are technological advances and people's openness to Bitcoin, the intervention of governments and financial powers by creating laws around cryptocurrencies and external events that are closely tied to the Bitcoin community.

AB Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.
   Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics.
   This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.
   Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three concurrent threads.

DE Distributed consensus; blockchains; fairness; Nash equilibrium
AB Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting-anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents "sybil attacks" (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. "moderately hard functions") introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto' 92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt' 15) and Pass et al (manuscript, 2016) demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a) honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network, b) the puzzle-hardness is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay and the total computational power of the network, and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. Assuming honest participation, however, is a strong assumption, especially in a setting where honest players are expected to perform a lot of work (to solve the computational puzzles). In Nakamoto's Bitcoin application of the blockchain protocol, players are incentivized to solve these puzzles by receiving rewards for every "block" (of transactions) they contribute to the blockchain. An elegant work by Eyal and Sirer (FinancialCrypt' 14), strengthening and formalizing an earlier attack discussed on the Bitcoin forum, demonstrates that a coalition controlling even a minority fraction of the computational power in the network can gain (close to) 2 times its "fair share" of the rewards (and transaction fees) by deviating from the protocol instructions. In contrast, in a fair protocol, one would expect that players controlling a phi fraction of the computational resources to reap a phi fraction of the rewards.
   We present a newblockchain protocol-the FruitChain protocol-which satisfies the same consistency and liveness properties as Nakamoto's protocol (assuming an honest majority of the computing power), and additionally is delta-approximately fair: with overwhelming probability, any honest set of players controlling a. fraction of computational power is guaranteed to get at least a fraction (1 - delta)phi of the blocks (and thus rewards) in any Omega(kappa/delta) length segment of the chain (where. is the security parameter). Consequently, if this blockchain protocol is used as the ledger underlying a cryptocurrency system, where rewards and transaction fees are evenly distributed among the miners of blocks in a length. segment of the chain, no coalition controlling less than a majority of the computing power can gain more than a factor (1 + 3 delta) by deviating from the protocol (i.e., honest participation is an n/2-coalition-safe 3 delta-Nash equilibrium). Finally, the FruitChain protocol enables decreasing the variance of mining rewards and as such significantly lessens (or even obliterates) the need for mining pools.

AB Blockchain and Internet of things are the most promising and upcoming technologies. Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.

AB Military operations enabled using networks involves generation, transmission, collection and analysis of mission critical data to enable better decision making capabilities to commanders at all levels to achieve the objectives. This data is generated by variety of heterogeneous elements like humans and equipment in the battlefield. It is of utmost importance to ensure high level of integrity, confidentiality and availability of this data in such an environment and to ensure its sustainability in hostile environments. This paper presents scope and detailed analysis of the idea of utilizing Blockchain technology as a viable solution for ensuring integrity and provenance of data to suit military operations using networks and maintaining sustainability of these networks. The core concepts of Blockchain are presented in a comprehensive manner along with its variations. Military operations enabled using networks are modeled using Network Enabled Military Operations (NEMO) model. The viable framework and architecture for incorporating Blockchain technology to suit security requirements has been analyzed using three case studies relevant in today's scenario.

AB Privacy audit logs are used to capture the actions of participants in a data sharing environment in order for auditors to check compliance with privacy policies. However, collusion may occur between the auditors and participants to obfuscate actions that should be recorded in the audit logs. In this paper, we propose a Linked Data based method of utilizing blockchain technology to create tamper-proof audit logs that provide proof of log manipulation and non-repudiation. We also provide experimental validation of the scalability of our solution using an existing Linked Data privacy audit log model.

AB The potential for blockchains to fundamentally transform how organizations produce and capture value is huge and very real. Practical applications dealing with nearly any type of digital asset demonstrate this capacity. Blockchain-based application architectures benefit from a set of unique properties including immutability and transparency of cryptographically-secured and peer-recorded transactions, which have been agreed upon by network consensus. Blockchain-based applications, however, may also suffer from high computational and storage expenses, negatively impacting overall performance and scalability. In this paper, we report on lessons learned and insights gained from a set of experimental blockchain projects, focusing on off-chaining: How to move computation and data off-the-chain, without compromising the properties introduced and benefits gained by using blockchains in the first place.

DE Consensus mechanism; Blockchain scalability; Quick query
AB Currently, most digital infrastructures for educational certificate management cannot guarantee data security and system trust. Using blockchain can solve this problem. However, there are still some defects with the existing blockchains that cannot be applied. Most of them are dependent on tokens, and limited by throughput and latency, moreover, no one can support certificate query with precise and high efficiency. In order to solve these problems, this paper presents educational certificate blockchain (ECBC) which can support low latency and high throughput, and provide a method to speed up queries. To reduce latency and increase throughput, consensus mechanism of ECBC uses the cooperation of peers to create blocks in place of the competition. ECBC builds a tree structure (MPT-Chain) which can not only provide an efficient query for a transaction, but also support historical transactions query of an account. MPT-Chain only needs short time to update and can speed up block verification. In addition, ECBC is designed with transaction format to protect user's privacy. The experiment shows that ECBC has better performance of throughput and latency, supporting quick query.

AB We present the results of our eighth annual horizon scan of emerging issues likely to affect global biological diversity, the environment, and conservation efforts in the future. The potential effects of these novel issues might not yet be fully recognized or understood by the global conservation community, and the issues can be regarded as both opportunities and risks. A diverse international team with collective expertise in horizon scanning, science communication, and conservation research, practice, and policy reviewed 100 potential issues and identified 15 that qualified as emerging, with potential substantial global effects. These issues include new developments in energy storage and fuel production, sand extraction, potential solutions to combat coral bleaching and invasive marine species, and blockchain technology.

TI Blockchain application and outlook in the banking industry
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION

DT Review
DE Blockchain; Decentralization; Banking industry transformation
AB Blockchain technology is a core, underlying technology with promising application prospects in the banking industry. On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of "multi-center, weakly intermediated" scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a "regulatory sandbox" and the development of industry standards.

AB Background: Bitcoin system, when more than 51% computing power is controlled by a single node, the block chain can be distorted maliciously. This is called 51% attack which is a well-known potential risk that could destroy the Bitcoin system.
   Method: The paper proves that under the current proof-of-work mechanism, computing power eventually will be centralized at a single node if miners are rational enough.
   Result: The paper propose a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralization and reduces the risk of 51% attack without increasing the risk of Sybil attack.
   Concusions: This new mechanism introduces a series of principles such as Career open to all talents, without distinction of birth, Distribution according to labor and All Men are created equal.

AB Blockchain has become a new frontier of venture capitals that has attracted the attention of banks, governments, and other business corporations. The recent blockchain related attempts included legal blockchains by Fadada. com and Microsoft and pork tracking blockchains by Walmart and IBM. Blockchain is poised to become the most exciting invention after the Internet; while the latter connects the world to enable new business models based on online business processes, the former will help resolve the trust issue more efficiently via network computing. In this paper, we give an overview on blockchain research and development as well as introduce the papers in this special issue. We show that while blockchain has enabled Bitcoin, the most successful digital currency, its widespread adoption in finance and other business sectors will lead to many business innovations as well as many research opportunities.

AB Bitcoin (BTC) is often cited as Libertarian. However, the technology underpinning Bitcoin, blockchain, has properties that make it ideally suited to Socialist paradigms. Current literature supports the Libertarian viewpoint by focusing on the ability of Bitcoin to bypass central authority and provide anonymity; rarely is there an examination of blockchain technology's capacity for decentralised transparency and auditability in support of a Socialist model. This paper conducts a review of the blockchain, Libertarianism, and Socialist philosophies. It then explores Socialist models of public ownership and looks at the unique cooperative properties of blockchain that make the technology ideal for supporting Socialist societies. In summary, this paper argues that blockchain technologies are not just a Libertarian tool, they also enhance Socialist forms of governance.

TI Securities, intermediation and the blockchain: an inevitable choice
   between liquidity and legal certainty?
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The practice of securities holding, transfer, and collateral has changed significantly over the past 200 years-moving from paper certificates and issuer registers, to an intermediated environment, and from there to computerization and globalization. These changes have made transacting more efficient and thus rendered markets more liquid. However, the law has lagged behind and is now itself an obstacle to efficiency because international securities transactions are subject to considerable legal uncertainty. The latest global market development, a cryptographic transfer process commonly called the blockchain, is the most recent efficiency-enhancing change. It offers a unique possibility to create a consistent legal framework for securities from scratch, on the basis of a legal concept that, to some extent, resembles bearer securities. This article shows what the new international legal framework could look like in the light of experience gained from earlier developments.

TI Fraud detections for online businesses: a perspective from blockchain

SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; Fraud detection; Rating fraud; Reputation systems
ID REPUTATION MECHANISMS; SYSTEM; REVIEWS; TRUST
AB Background: The reputation system has been designed as an effective mechanism to reduce risks associated with online shopping for customers. However, it is vulnerable to rating fraud. Some raters may inject unfairly high or low ratings to the system so as to promote their own products or demote their competitors.
   Method: This study explores the rating fraud by differentiating the subjective fraud from objective fraud. Then it discusses the effectiveness of blockchain technology in objective fraud and its limitation in subjective fraud, especially the rating fraud. Lastly, it systematically analyzes the robustness of blockchain-based reputation systems in each type of rating fraud.
   Results: The detection of fraudulent raters is not easy since they can behave strategically to camouflage themselves. We explore the potential strengths and limitations of blockchain-based reputation systems under two attack goals: ballot-stuffing and bad-mouthing, and various attack models including constant attack, camouflage attack, whitewashing attack and sybil attack. Blockchain-based reputation systems are more robust against bad-mouthing than ballot-stuffing fraud.
   Conclusions: Blockchain technology provides new opportunities for redesigning the reputation system. Blockchain systems are very effective in preventing objective information fraud, such as loan application fraud, where fraudulent information is fact-based. However, their effectiveness is limited in subjective information fraud, such as rating fraud, where the ground-truth is not easily validated. Blockchain systems are effective in preventing bad mouthing and whitewashing attack, but they are limited in detecting ballot-stuffing under sybil attack, constant attacks and camouflage attack.

AB Background: The notion of smart city has grown popular over the past few years. It embraces several dimensions depending on the meaning of the word "smart" and benefits from innovative applications of new kinds of information and communications technology to support communal sharing.
   Methods: By relying on prior literature, this paper proposes a conceptual framework with three dimensions: (1) human, (2) technology, and (3) organization, and explores a set of fundamental factors that make a city smart from a sharing economy perspective.
   Results: Using this triangle framework, we discuss what emerging blockchain technology may contribute to these factors and how its elements can help smart cities develop sharing services.
   Conclusions: This study discusses how blockchain-based sharing services can contribute to smart cities based on a conceptual framework. We hope it can stimulate interest in theory and practice to foster discussions in this area.

AB Equity crowdfunding via the Internet is a new channel of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.

AB Security and privacy are huge challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, but unfortunately, the harmonization of the IoT-related standards and protocols is hardly and slowly widespread. In this paper, we propose a new framework for access control in IoT based on the blockchain technology. Our first contribution consists in providing a reference model for our proposed framework within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanism specification in IoT. In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager. Unlike financial bitcoin transactions, FairAccess introduces new types of transactions that are used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access. As a proof of concept, we establish an initial implementation with a Raspberry PI device and local blockchain. Finally, we discuss some limitations and propose further opportunities.

ID DISCHARGE CONTROL-SYSTEM; FRAMEWORK
AB The ASDEX Upgrade Discharge Control System (DCS) is a distributed real-time control system executing complex control and monitoring tasks. Up to now, DCS control algorithms have been implemented by coding dedicated application processes with the C++ programming language. Algorithm changes required code modification, compilation and commissioning which only experienced programmers could perform. This was a significant constraint of flexibility for both control system operation and design.
   The new approach extends DCS with the capability of configuration-defined control algorithms. These are composed of chains of small, configurable standard function blocks providing general purpose functions like algebraic operations, filters, feedback controllers, output limiters and decision logic. In a later phase a graphical editor could help to compose and modify such configuration in a Simulink-like fashion.
   Building algorithms from standard functions can result in a high number of elements. In order to achieve a similar performance as with C++ coding, it is essential to avoid administrative bottlenecks by design. As a consequence, DCS executes a function block chain in the context of a single real-time thread of an application process. No concurrency issues as in a multi-threaded context need to be considered resulting in strongly simplified signal handling and zero performance overhead for inter-block communication. Instead of signal-driven synchronization, a block scheduler derives the execution sequence automatically from the block dependencies as defined in the configuration. All blocks and connecting signals are instantiated dynamically, based on definitions in a configuration file. Algorithms thus are not defined in the code but only in the configuration.
   The concept has been developed in view of Simulink block libraries and MARTe General Application Modules (GAM) but extends these with the DCS virtues of distributed computing and multi-threading.
   With growing diversity of general-purpose blocks the DCS framework will reach an unprecedented degree of universality and flexibility. Configuration-defined algorithms will gradually replace many existing DCS applications. Finally, the concept might also become of interest for the upcoming ITER plasma control system.

AB The formation mechanisms of worm-like vesicles were determined by the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly of an amphiphilic poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid) diblock copolymer, PMAA-b-P(MMA-r-MAA). The photopolymerization-induced self-assembly was performed by the nitroxde-mediated photo-controlled/living radical polymerization in an aqueous methanol solution using a PMAA end-capped with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. The polymerization retained its living nature during the self-assembly. The copolymer during the early stage of the polymerization produced cup-like vesicles that had some holes in the surface and were comprised of a thin and flexible bilayer. As the hydrophobic P(MMA-r-MAA) block chain was extended by the polymerization progress, the cup-like vesicles were transformed into spherical vesicles, accompanied by decreases in the number of holes and their size. Further extension of the hydrophobic block chain enhanced the intervesicular aggregation to provide worm-like vesicles. These morphological changes were accounted for by variation in the critical packing shape of the copolymer by expansion of the hydrophobic chain volume.

TI Modeling and Simulation of the Economics of Mining in the Bitcoin Market
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB In January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto gave rise to the "Bitcoin Blockchain", creating the first block of the chain hashing on his computer's central processing unit (CPU). Since then, the hash calculations to mine Bitcoin have been getting more and more complex, and consequently the mining hardware evolved to adapt to this increasing difficulty. Three generations of mining hardware have followed the CPU's generation. They are GPU's, FPGA's and ASIC's generations. This work presents an agent-based artificial market model of the Bitcoin mining process and of the Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this work is to model the economy of the mining process, starting from GPU's generation, the first with economic significance. The model reproduces some "stylized facts" found in real-time price series and some core aspects of the mining business. In particular, the computational experiments performed can reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering of Bitcoin price series. In addition, under proper assumptions, they can reproduce the generation of Bitcoins, the hashing capability, the power consumption, and the mining hardware and electrical energy expenditures of the Bitcoin network.

TI Where Is Current Research on Blockchain Technology?-A Systematic Review
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
AB Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations. In this research, we have conducted a systematic mapping study with the goal of collecting all relevant research on Blockchain technology. Our objective is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding Blockchain technology from the technical perspective. We have extracted 41 primary papers from scientific databases. The results show that focus in over 80% of the papers is on Bitcoin system and less than 20% deals with other Blockchain applications including e.g. smart contracts and licensing. The majority of research is focusing on revealing and improving limitations of Blockchain from privacy and security perspectives, but many of the proposed solutions lack concrete evaluation on their effectiveness. Many other Blockchain scalability related challenges including throughput and latency have been left unstudied. On the basis of this study, recommendations on future research directions are provided for researchers.

AB In the context of the 'selfish-mine' strategy proposed by Eyal and Sirer, we study the effect of communication delay on the evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain. First, we use a simplified Markov model that tracks the contrasting states of belief about the blockchain of a small pool of dishonest miners and the 'rest of the community' to establish that the use of block-hiding strategies, such as selfish-mine, causes the rate of production of orphan blocks to increase. Then we use a spatial Poisson process model to study values of Eyal and Sirer's parameter gamma, which denotes the proportion of the honest community that mines on a previously-secret block released by the pool in response to the mining of a block by the honest community. Finally, we use discrete-event simulation to study the behaviour of a network of Bitcoin miners, a proportion of which is colluding in using the selfish-mine strategy, under the assumption that there is a delay in the communication of information between miners. The models indicate that both the dishonest and the honest miners were worse off than they would have been if no dishonest mining were present, and that it is possible for the mining community to detect block-hiding behaviour, such as that used in selfish-mine, by monitoring the rate of production of orphan blocks.

AB Healthcare data are a valuable source of healthcare intelligence. Sharing of healthcare data is one essential step to make healthcare system smarter and improve the quality of healthcare service. Healthcare data, one personal asset of patient, should be owned and controlled by patient, instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems, which prevents data sharing and puts patient privacy at risks. Blockchain is demonstrated in the financial field that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we proposed an App (called Healthcare Data Gateway (HGD)) architecture based on blockchain to enable patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating privacy, which provides a new potential way to improve the intelligence of healthcare systems while keeping patient data private. Our proposed purpose-centric access model ensures patient own and control their healthcare data; simple unified Indicator-Centric Schema (ICS) makes it possible to organize all kinds of personal healthcare data practically and easily. We also point out that MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computing) is one promising solution to enable untrusted third-party to conduct computation over patient data without violating privacy.

AB Unlike conventional one-way power flow, smart grid system is of intelligent power grid, based on interaction between power supplier and buyer. In this interactive environment, for example, power user that has its own power production facility can re-sell electricity produced in the self-production facility to other users. A control center supplies and re-sells electricity as key operator. However, the supply of electricity comes to halt when the server of the key operator suddenly fails. Although smart grid can be an alternative to prevent blackout in this case, it is useless if power is not smoothly supplied to power grid even in a normal condition except blackout. In this respect, the present study was aimed to propose P2P energy loan service using block chain-based P2P loan process. Therefore, the proposed power grid system is efficient and can secure reliability by verifying the details of each energy transaction in a server. In addition, block chain technology proposed in this study does not require additional installation of infrastructure such as server and instead users can use existing resources in operating power grid system. This study confirmed that the encryption and security elements of the proposed system are safe from man-in-the-middle attack, replay attack, and masquerading attack. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed P2P energy loan design can be applied to smart grid environment.

AB An article in The Economist in October 2015 stated that land registries across much of the world are "badly kept, mismanaged and/or corrupt". This causes insecurity and injustice. It also means that it can be difficult for citizens to use their property as collateral for a mortgage, which hampers economic development. Building good and reliable land administration systems, however, can be a complicated and expensive activity. Now, a secure mechanism called blockchain, originally developed to handle and store transactions in the bitcoin digital currency, offers a chance for land administration by providing trust by definition.

AB Over the past year, the international property rights sector has been abuzz with the potential for blockchain technology to fundamentally transform the approach to land administration. Even Peruvian economist and expert on property rights Hernando de Soto himself became part of this discussion in June 2015 while on Richard Branson's private island, brainstorming as to how blockchain might be applicable to the land sector. However, the initial frenzy has waned as the implementation of blockchain has demonstrated that the technology is not simply a wholesale 'fix' of the land sector, but rather should be applied realistically and piloted at a reasonable scale.

ID TRUST
AB Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform.

AB The 2,2-biphenyl-4,4-dicarboxylate (H(2)bpy-4,4-dc) and 2,2-Bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-biphenyl (bipb) have been selected as the bridging ligands. One zinc(II) MOF, [Zn(bpy-4,4-dc)(bipb)](n) has been successfully obtained by hydrothermal reaction and synthesis. The molecular structure has been elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complex possesses of 1D block chain [(bpy-4,4-dc)(2)(bibp)(2)Zn-4]. Taking advantage of the tetrahedral coordination preference of the Zn metal centers, the connected chains adopt a folding conformation to form a two-dimensional architecture. The complex was further characterized by IR spectroscopy, PXRD pattern, fluorescent spectra, and thermal stability measurements.

DT Article
AB This article provides insight into how Blockchains work. A block chain or Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records that are hardened against tampering and revision, even by operators of the data store's nodes. One can view a Blockchain as a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to previous blocks forming a chain. Importantly, blocks are added to the Blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each miner gets a copy of the Blockchain when joining the Bitcoin network. The Blockchain they receive has complete and accurate information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.

ID COMPUTATION
AB Graph databases have become a common infrastructure component. Yet existing systems either operate on offline snapshots, provide weak consistency guarantees, or use expensive concurrency control techniques that limit performance. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph database, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable ACID transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain. info, and achieves 10 : 9x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.

AB We investigate the self-assembly and aggregation behaviors of nanoparticles in hybrid assemblies made from amphiphilic block copolymer tethered nanoparticles using the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)) approach. By varying the arm number of the tethered amphiphilic block copolymers, hydrophobic block chain length, and interaction parameter between nanoparticle and hydrophobic block, different morphelogical hybrid aggregates are obtained, including branching rod-like micelles, ring-like disk-like micelles, and vesicles. Most importantly, the nanoparticles aggregate in the various micelles and form nanowires, nanorings, and nanoclusters. Only using amphiphilic block copolymer tethered nanoparticles, hybrid vesicles induding patchy vesicles-and heterogeneous vesicles are obtained. Moreover, nanodusters with distinct-number of nanoparticles in hybrid disk-like micelles and vesicles are fabricated through controlling the interaction parameter between nanoparticle and hydrophobic block.

DT Article
AB This paper presents the first generalized reputation system that can be applied to multiple networks that is based on the blockchain. We first discuss current reputation systems, conducting a critical analysis of their current security vulnerabilities, before looking at how new blockchain-based technologies are used. We propose an innovative new reputation system that is based on blockchain technologies and which aims to solve many unanswered questions in the current generation of reputation systems, as well as blockchain systems in general. We then consider the limitations of such a system, before using simulations and analyses to demonstrate methods of overcoming these limitations, and in doing so, provide a possible solution to a fundamental issue in blockchain-based networks; scalability. We conclude by suggesting areas for future studies, and summarizing our findings.

TI A Composition Method of Logical Function Block Chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
DE SDN; ForCES; Logical Function Block; Composition
AB ForCES is a new open programmable architecture, it separates control and forwarding, it also abstracts resources of Forwarding Elements (FE) into some Logical Function Blocks (LFB), Control Element (CE) can reconfigure the forwarding function of FEs by recomposing their LFB chains. Firstly, A SDN architecture based on ForCES is proposed. Then, based on the formalization of the concept of LFB and the traditional I/O matching algorithm, an LFB chain composition method is proposed. This method can combine a series of LFBs to an LFB chain according to special application request. Based on the LFB chain composition algorithm, an improved algorithm is proposed, which can improve the composition efficiency. At last, an example is provided to illustrate how this method works, and a simulation is given to compare the efficiency of the base algorithm and the improved algorithm.

AB In this explorative study, we examine the economy and transaction network of the decentralized digital currency Bitcoin during the first four years of its existence. The objective is to develop insights into the evolution of the Bitcoin economy during this period. For this, we establish and analyze a novel integrated dataset that enriches data from the Bitcoin blockchain with off-network data such as business categories and geo-locations. Our analyses reveal the major Bitcoin businesses and markets. Our results also give insights on the business distribution by countries and how businesses evolve over time. We also show that there is a gambling network that features many very small transactions. Furthermore, regional differences in the adoption and business distribution could be found. In the network analysis, the small world phenomenon is investigated and confirmed for several subgraphs of the Bitcoin network.

AB Crypto-currencies like Bitcoin have recently attracted a lot of interest. A crucial ingredient into such systems is the "mining" of a Nakamoto blockchain. We model mining as a Poisson process with time-dependent intensity and use this model to derive predictions about block times for various hash-rate scenarios (exponentially rising hash rate being the most important). We also analyse Bitcoin's method to update the "network difficulty" as a mechanism to keep block times stable. Since it yields systematically too fast blocks for exponential hash-rate growth, we propose a new method to update difficulty. Our proposed method performs much better at ensuring stable average block times over longer periods of time, which we verify both in simulations of artificial growth scenarios and with real-world data. Besides Bitcoin itself, this has practical benefits particularly for systems like Namecoin. It can be used to make name expiration times more predictable, preventing accidental loss of names.

We propose a temporal "rolling" blockchain which solves the problem of its current exponential growth, instead replacing it with a constant fixed-size blockchain. We conduct a thorough analysis of related work and present a formal analysis of the new rolling blockchain, comparing the results to a traditional blockchain model to demonstrate that the deletion of data from the blockchain does not impact on the security of the proposed blockchain model before concluding our work and presenting future work to be conducted.

AB Blockchain is a decentralized ledger used to securely exchange digital currency, perform deals and transactions. Each member of the network has access to the latest copy of encrypted ledger so that they can validate a new transaction.
   Blockchain ledger is a collection of all Bitcoin transactions executed in the past. Basically, it's a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing tamper proof data structure blocks which holds batches of individual transactions. The completed blocks are added in a linear and chronological order. Each block contains a timestamp and information link which points to a previous block. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer permission-less network which allows every user to connect to the network and send new transaction to verify and create new blocks.
   Satoshi Nakamoto described design of Bitcoin digital currency in his research paper posted to cryptography listsery in 2008. Nakamoto's suggestion has solved long pending problem of cryptographers and laid the foundation stone for digital currency.
   This paper explains the concept, characteristics, need of Blockchain and how Bitcoin works. It attempts to highlights role of Blockchain in shaping the future of banking, financial institutions and adoption of Internet of Things(IoT).

DE Blockchain; Bitcoin; Sharding; Distributed hash table
AB To preserve the Bitcoin ledger's integrity, a node that joins the system must download a full copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain if it wants to verify newly created blocks.
   At the time of writing, the blockchain weights 79 GiB and takes hours of processing on high-end machines. Owners of low-resource devices (known as thin nodes), such as smartphones, avoid that cost by either opting for minimum verification or by depending on full nodes, which weakens their security model.
   In this work, we propose to harden the security model of thin nodes by enabling them to verify blocks in an adaptive manner, with regards to the level of targeted confidence, with low storage requirements and a short bootstrap time. Our approach exploits sharding within adistributed hash table (DHT) to distribute the storage load, and a few additional hashes to prevent attacks on this new system.

AB Financial transaction networks are some of the largest networks in existence. A relatively new type of financial networks is the digital (crypto) currency network, e.g., Bitcoin. Namecoin is an alternative crypto currency, based on Bitcoin, with additional features such as DNS. Namecoin network has more than 2 million nodes and almost 17 million edges. The analysis of such a crypto currency network can help us model or predict the future growth of the transaction networks. In order to analyze the transaction network graph over time, we analyzed the Namecoin blockchain data in 7 six months intervals. Our findings suggest different user behavior and developing pattern compared to Bitcoin.

AB Bitcoin is a digital payment system empowered by a distributed database called blockchain. The blockchain is an open ledger containing records of every transaction within Bitcoin system maintained by Bitcoin nodes all over the world. Because of its availability and robustness, the blockchain could be utilized as a record-keeping tool for information not related to any Bitcoin transactions. We propose a method of utilizing the blockchain of Bitcoin system to publish information by embedding an arbitrary size of data into Bitcoin transactions. By publishing information using the blockchain, the information also carries the characteristics of Bitcoin transaction: anonymous, decentralized, and permanent. The proposed protocol could be used to extend the functionality of asset management systems which are limited to a maximum of 80 bytes data. The proposed method also offers an efficiency of the transaction fee by 18 percent compared to Bitcoin Messaging protocol.

ID BODY
AB Modern technologies of mobile computing and wireless sensing prompt the concept of pervasive social network (PSN)-based healthcare. To realize the concept, the core problem is how a PSN node can securely share health data with other nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a secure system for PSN-based healthcare. Two protocols are designed for the system. The first one is an improved version of the IEEE 802.15.6 display authenticated association. It establishes secure links with unbalanced computational requirements for mobile devices and resource-limited sensor nodes. The second protocol uses blockchain technique to share health data among PSN nodes. We realize a protocol suite to study protocol runtime and other factors. In addition, human body channels are proposed for PSN nodes in some use cases. The proposed system illustrates a potential method of using blockchain for PSN-based applications.

AB Low cost, high performance and on-demand access of cloud infrastructure facilitates individuals and organizations to outsource their high volume of data to cloud storage system. With continuously increasing demand of cloud storage, security of users' data in cloud is becoming a great challenge. One of the security concerns is ensuring integrity of the data stored in the cloud, and trusted third-party based public auditing is a standard technique for cloud data authentication. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an auditing scheme for cloud data without requiring a third party. We exploit the block-chain data structure of Bitcoins to propose an auditing mechanism whereby any user can perform the validation of selected files efficiently. In case a user does not possess the required computational resource for verification, or a user is reluctant to do the verification, our scheme provides the option for third party verification as well, without any additional overhead of data structure, computation or storage.

AB Even if the core technologies for the semantic web are in place, it still lacks some layers that prevent it from being a fully implemented system. One of these layers is the trustworthiness one. In this paper we propose a way to implement trust by the usage of the technology that stays behind the cryptocurrencies. After an analysis of the existing blockchains, an example is built on top of Openchain in order to demonstrate our approach.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB To accommodate the trend toward mass customization launched by intelligent manufacturing, the paper proposes the adoption of model-integrated computing (MIC) paradigm in the motion control system development process for enhancing flexibility and robustness. Hierarchical structural and behavioral diversities in motion control system are considered during the implementation of MIC paradigm. For design-phase implementation, a motion-control-domain-specific modeling language is developed, and formal semantics are integrated. With regard to execution-phase implementation, a real-time runtime framework compliant with the IEC 61499 standard is proposed. Extensions of function block chain and priority-based event propagation are proposed. Dynamically extendable FB types library for motion control domain is constructed. A prototype three-axis motion control system is modeled using the proposed modelling language and is then deployed to the implemented framework to prove the feasibility of the adoption of the MIC paradigm in motion control domain.

AB A Keyless Signing Infrastructure (KSI) provides users with a means to timestamp documents on a per-second basis. The KSI consists of a global infrastructure with several server layers and by using Merkle hash trees, the root hash can be used to verify the integrity and timestamp of a document. Regular publication of root hashes, e.g., once per month, allows a document to be verified without support of the servers, but the previously proposed publication channels have several limitations. In this paper we address these limitations and show how a blockchain can be used as an additional publication layer on top of a KSI. Using the scripting capabilities in transactions, new features are introduced to the publication of root hashes. This includes faster publication, proof of origin for the publisher and the possibility for third parties to explicitly verify root hashes before they are published. These improvements will allow the verification of documents to be simpler, more flexible and more secure.

AB We sequenced several cannabis genomes in 2011 of June and the first and the longest contigs to emerge were the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. Having been a contributor to the Human Genome Project and an eye-witness to the real benefits of immediate data release, I have first hand experience with the potential mal-investment of millions of dollars of tax payer money narrowly averted due to the adopted global rapid data release policy. The policy was vital in reducing duplication of effort and economic waste. As a result, we felt obligated to publish the Cannabis genome data in a similar spirit and placed them immediately on a cloud based Amazon server in August of 2011. While these rapid data release practices were heralded by many in the media, we still find some authors fail to find or reference said work and hope to compel the readership that this omission has more pervasive repercussions than bruised egos and is a regression for our community.

AB The personal cloud, a virtual compute instance controlled by an individual, is becoming inevitable. We believe that the current interoperability and communications evolution will drive the adoption of personal clouds. In order to provide personal cloud interoperability, we propose an end to end authentication mechanism based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and the blockchain. JWTs are a standardized container format to encode personal cloud and client related information in a secure way using "claims". The distributed, undeletable, immutable, and irreversible nature of the blockchain has appropriate attributes for distributed credential storage and decentralized identity management.

AB Recently, Wi-Fi hotspots are installed at several places. However most communications are not encrypted and the illegal can use it maliciously, therefore effective breakthrough are required.
   We propose a solution of these problems using a new method derived from Bitcoin. This method uses Blockchain and logs of user access are saved to it. The administrators can identify illegal person and collect user's statistics. Bitcoin address can be used as encryption keys for communications.
   The Blockchain also provides a platform of regional applications. Furthermore, systems can cooperate with others at different places.

AB The use of digital applications is on the rise nowadays. So the processing of those data is done by a tool calledMapReduce. MapReduce has its own structure which cannot be modified. While processing those data, skew will occur in both map and reduce the phase. Map skew is easy to reduce but in case of reduced phase it may take time to reduce it. So a methodology is being created to reduce the Reducer side skew and time being compared between the new method and MapReduce to find their efficiency.

AB After the global financial crisis 2008, the world has been putting more effort in tightening banking and financial activities with stricter regulations. However, the effectiveness of this policy has remained controversial as many people believe that policy makers should promote freedom and transparency by empowering the public to directly interfere and change the system for public interest. This article attempts to synthesize and analyze available information with a focus on the role of blockchain, a financial tool that can potentially play an important role in the sustainable development of the global economy. The new technology is expected to bring massive benefits to consumers, to current banking system and to the whole society in general.

AB Blockchain technology has emerged as a solution to consistency problems in peer to peer networks. By now, it has matured as a solution to a range of use cases in which it can effectively provide the notion of third party trust without the need for a trusted (physical) third party, which makes it an attractive coordination mechanism for distributed systems. To promote the wide adoption of this technology, we yet lack mechanisms that make the specification and interpretation of smart contracts accessible to a broader audience. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that supports the semi-automated translation of human-readable contract representations into computational equivalents in order to enable the codification of laws into verifiable and enforceable computational structures that reside within a public blockchain. We identify smart contract components that correspond to real world institutions, and propose a mapping that we operationalize using a domain-specific language in order to support the contract modeling process. We explore this capability based on selected examples and plot out directions for future research on smart contracts.

ID CONSENSUS
AB Blockchain is a distributed timestamp server technology introduced for realization of Bitcoin, a digital cash system. It has been attracting much attention especially in the areas of financial and legal applications. But such applications would fail if they are designed without knowledge of the fundamental differences in blockchain from existing technology.
   We show that blockchain is a probabilistic state machine in which participants can never commit on decisions; we also show that this probabilistic nature is necessarily deduced from the condition where the number of participants remains unknown. This work provides useful abstractions to think about blockchain, and raises discussion for promoting the better use of the technology.

AB BITCOIN is a novel decentralized cryptocurrency system which has recently received a great attention from a wider audience. An interesting and unique feature of this system is that the complete list of all the transactions occurred from its inception is publicly available. This enables the investigation of funds movements to uncover interesting properties of the BITCOIN economy. In this paper we present a set of analyses of the user graph, i.e. the graph obtained by an heuristic clustering of the graph of BITCOIN transactions. Our analyses consider an up-to-date BITCOIN blockchain, as in December 2015, after the exponential explosion of the number of transactions occurred in the last two years. The set of analyses we defined includes, among others, the analysis of the time evolution of BITCOIN network, the verification of the "rich get richer" conjecture and the detection of the nodes which are critical for the network connectivity.

AB Blockchain technology has shown its considerable adaptability in recent years as a variety of market sectors sought ways of incorporating its abilities into their operations. While so far most of the focus has been on the financial services industry, several projects in other service related areas such as healthcare show this is beginning to change. Numerous starting points for Blockchain technology in the healthcare industry are the focus of this report. With examples for public healthcare management, user-oriented medical research and drug counterfeiting in the pharmaceutical sector, this report aims to illustrate possible influences, goals and potentials connected to this disruptive technology.

AB We present (DNS)-N-3, a system to replace the current top level DNS system and certificate authorities, offering increased scalability, security and robustness.
   (DNS)-N-3 is based on a distributed hash table and utilizes a domain name ownership system based on the Bitcoin blockchain. It addresses previous criticism that a DHT would not suffice as a DNS replacement.
   (DNS)-N-3 provides solutions to current DNS vulnerabilities such as DDOS attacks, DNS spoofing and censorship by local governments. (DNS)-N-3 eliminates the need for certificate authorities by providing a decentralized authenticated record of domain name ownership. Unlike previous DNS replacement proposals, (DNS)-N-3 is reverse compatible with DNS and allows for incremental implementation within the current system.

AB There have been many speculations on how a post-human world would look like: the speculations regarded the fact that we would need eternal life, on the one hand, and on the other hand that artificial intelligence would exceed human intelligence, etc. What we do not know yet - but we can speculate on it regards the role of the economy in the post-human society. Does the economy exist in such a society? We believe it does, and we also believe that the economy will not lose its status along with the transition from a society to another. Considering that in the post-human era the individual will live in a virtual space, having a virtual family and virtual friends, behind this space there will be the so-called (human or nonhuman) workers who will take care of the maintenance of these virtual spaces, ensuring the eternal life.
   We are witnessing an emulation regarding the possible types of economy, something like a hyper-technique, which is capable to interact with the economic and social mechanisms.
   At the same time, these new features are continuously supported by humans; in fact, a new kind of human. The block chain is considered a form of information technology, provided by intelligent agents.
   In order to make a connection with the, Brave new world" of A. Huxley[3], we believe that a modern version of soft slavery is also possible; within it, the post-human individuals will overpower the inferior individuals by means of genetic engineering techniques and not only.
   The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of the economy within a post-human society. Within our approach we will present aspects related to genetic engineering, trans-humanism, human enhancement and immortality in order to outline the fact that we cannot give up the economy even though we achieve eternal life.

AB Blockchain represents a technology for establishing a shared, immutable version of the truth between a network of participants that do not trust one another, and therefore has the potential to disrupt any financial or other industries that rely on third-parties to establish trust. In order to better understand the current ecosystem of Blockchain applications, a scalable proof-of- concept pipeline for analysis of multiple streams of semi-structured data posted on social media is demonstrated, based on open source components. Deep Web as well as conventional social media are considered. Preliminary analysis suggests that data found in the Deep Web is complimentary to that available on the conventional web. Future work is described that will scale the system to cloud-based, real-time, analysis of multiple data streams, with Information Extraction (IE) (ex. sentiment analysis) and Machine Learning capability.

AB Recent work introduced the concept of NRGcoin [1] - a decentralized digital currency for renewable energy, based on Blockchain technology. In this abstract we summarize the concept and outline how this currency benefits each stakeholder in the smart grid and the renewable energy economy as a whole.
   The NRGcoin concept is visualized in Figure 1. When a prosumer generates energy and injects it in the grid (1), she receives information from the grid operator (2) on the balance of supply and demand in the micro-grid (or district). This information is then used by the smart meter at that agent's home to securely create (3) (also issue, or " mint"), new digital units (or NRGcoins) for that prosumer. For every 1kWh of renewable energy that the prosumer injects in the grid, her smart meter creates 1 NRGcoin. At any time, the prosumer can offer to sell her coins (4) on the NRGcoin currency market -a FOREXtype currency exchange. Consumers join the NRGcoin market and buy NRGcoins (5) using fiat currency, e.g. Euro, Dollar, Pound, etc. When consumers use green energy from the grid (6), their smart meter automatically pays for that consumption using NRGcoins (7), instead of traditional currency. 1 kWh green energy consumption from the grid costs 1 NRGcoin, regardless of the current retail cost of energy. Nevertheless, since NRGcoin is linked to energy, which in turn is linked to money, NRGcoin is indirectly linked to the monetary value of energy, unlike other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, which are not linked to any particular value. Thus it is expected that NRGcoin will always fluctuate closely around the retail value of electricity. All digital transactions of NRGcoins, including their creation, are governed by the decentralized NRGcoin protocol -a piece of software running on the peer-to-peer network of smart meters. This protocol is based on the Blockchain technology [2].
   Thus the NRGcoin concept offers a number of benefits to each stakeholder in the smart grid. It serves as:
   a subsidy scheme for renewable installations with lower risk against policy change for prosumers. The issuance of the currency is governed by a decentralized protocol that can only be changed by a majority vote and thus not by individual market actors.
   a currency that offers consumers an alternative payment choice and cheaper green energy. High NRGcoin supply on the currency exchange market will drive NRGcoin price down, resulting in lower cost of green energy.
   a financial tool offering faster cash flow and profit to retailers and grid operators. As a peer-to-peer currency, NRGcoin can process micro- payments, e. g. payments for energy every 15 minutes, at virtually zero overhead costs.
   a mechanism that reduces the need for government support schemes, since prosumers are generating their own money, thus saving on budget.
   an asset from which investors profit when electricity prices increase. Buying the currency at the current retail price of energy and selling at a later point will generate profits, asit has been estimated that electricity prices tend to increase, rather than decrease [4].

AB Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.

ID UNIVERSAL ACCUMULATORS
AB Cryptographic accumulators are a tool for compact set representation and secure set membership proofs. When an element is added to a set by means of an accumulator, a membership witness is generated. This witness can later be used to prove the membership of the element. Typically, the membership witness has to be synchronized with the accumulator value: it has to be updated every time another element is added to the accumulator, and it cannot be used with outdated accumulator values. However, in many distributed applications (such as blockchain-based public key infrastructures), requiring strict synchronization is prohibitive. We define low update frequency, which means that a witness only needs to be updated a small number of times, and old-accumulator compatibility, which means that a witness can be used with outdated accumulator values. Finally, we propose an accumulator that achieves both of those properties.

DE Ethereum; Paxos anomaly; smart contract
ID TIME
AB Most popular blockchain solutions rely on proof-of-work to guarantee that participants reach consensus on a unique block per index of the chain. As consensus is impossible in the general case, it seems that these blockchain systems require messages are delivered fast and no participant mines faster than the crowd. To date, no experimental settings have however been proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis.
   In this paper, we identify conditions under which these blockchain systems fail to ensure consensus and present a reproducible execution on our Ethereum private chain. To this end, we introduce the Blockchain Anomaly, the impossibility for the blockchain to guarantee that a committed transaction is not abortable. This anomaly may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of proof-of-work blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like "Bob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice" impossible and may lead to double spending. We also explain how the anomaly differs from a 51-percent attack and how one could avoid it by adapting the Ethereum implementation or by exploiting smart contracts.

AB Decentralized cryptocurrency systems offer a medium of exchange secured by cryptography, without the need of a centralized banking authority. Among others, Bitcoin is considered as the most mature one. Its popularity lies on the introduction of the concept of the blockchain, a public distributed ledger shared by all participants of the system. Double spending attacks and blockchain forks are two main issues in blockchain-based protocols. The first one refers to the ability of an adversary to use the very same bitcoin more than once, while blockchain forks cause transient inconsistencies in the blockchain. We show through probabilistic analysis that the reliability of recent solutions that exclusively rely on a particular type of Bitcoin actors, called miners, to guarantee the consistency of Bitcoin operations, drastically decreases with the size of the blockchain.

AB Blockchain is a radical innovation that has a significant impact on payments, stock exchanges, cybersecurity, and computational law. However, it has significant limitations regarding uncertainty for a transaction to be confirmed. This paper proposes a new system for exact confirmation of transactions in a block. Replacing original signature, a new Interactive Incontestable Signature (IIS) scheme is used between dealer and owner to confirm a transaction. By this signature, the dealer can assure the owner that a transaction will be included into blockchain in a non-repudiation way. The scheme is proved to be secure for owner's unforgeability and dealer's incontestability.

AB Existing security mechanisms for managing the Internet infrastructural resources like IP addresses, AS numbers, BGP advertisements and DNS mappings rely on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that can be potentially compromised by state actors and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers.
   In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.

AB Context Integrity Measurement Architecture (CIMA) was inspired by risk assessments used by credit card companies. These assessments flag excursions from "normal" or "typical" behavior. If an excursion exceeds some threshold level, the card companies require additional proof of identity before allowing a transaction to proceed. CIMA generalizes this idea to measure excursions from physical and/or logical conditions relevant to mobile security. The CIMA concept encompasses identity management, measurement of context integrity, contextbased encryption, mutual authentication, measurement of contextual proximity, and calculation of security risk scores. CIMA uses context as a shared secret between the mobile device and the enterprise, enabling very efficient setup of one-time session encryption keys and mutual authentication. The architecture can measure the proximity of current context to historical contexts without exposing raw sensor details-a privacy-preserving feature. The architecture obfuscates sensor data by hashing it, and retains only hashes at the enterprise level. CIMA assigns weights-either manually or automatically-to the value of sensor data. The architecture can be implemented with a lightweight engine on the mobile device, and with a searchable and auditable context ledger at the enterprise or cloud level. Peer-to-peer applications may need to sacrifice the auditable context ledger due to processing constraints.

AB Herein it is proposed a simple algorithm for automatic hopping among mining pools in the Bitcoin network. The hopping ceases to occur when the best pool to be mined is found. The choice of the best pool is based on statistical data generated and collected during the operation of the Bitcoin network. Experiments for validation and performance analysis are based on mining networks built specifically for this purpose. The major results show for instance that the bitcoin generation increases at 46.0% comparing to when the mining is carried out in only one isolated pool. Additionally, it is evaluated the possibility of implementing a distributed application making use of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, general conclusions and possible avenues for future works are highlighted at the end of this article.

AB Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptocurrency since its appearance back in 2009. However, its main drawback to become a truly global payment system is its low capacity in transaction throughput. At present time, some ideas have been proposed to increase the transaction throughput, with different impact on the scalability of the system. Some of these ideas propose to decouple standard transactions from the blockchain core and to manage them through a parallel payment network, relegating the usage of the bitcoin blockchain only to transactions which consolidate multiple of those off-chain movements. Such mechanisms generate new actors in the bitcoin payment scenario, the Payment Service Providers, and new privacy issues arise regarding bitcoin users. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the most relevant scalability solutions proposed for the bitcoin network and we outline its impact on users' privacy based on the early stage proposals published so far.

DE Decentralized autonomous organizations; E-governance; Smart contract;
   Open cloud ecosystem; Service orientation
AB The emergence of blockchain 2.0 technology enables novel agile business networking collaborations for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Smart contracts are enactable by service-oriented cloud computing and blockchain technology for governing DAOs that engage in business collaborations. The distributed governance infrastructure (DGI) for such governance involves an ecosystem of agents, policies, services, and so on. To the best of our knowledge, a formal investigation of the lifecycle for establishing such a DGI has not been explored so far. This paper fills the gap by establishing a formalized DGI intended for the enactment of smart contracts for electronic communities of DAOs. The evaluation of the DGI-lifecycle is performed by means of model checking and discussing what pre-existing systems and also by means of discussing what pre-existing solutions exist for an application-system implementation.

DE Accountability; Blockchain; p2p; Arbitration
AB Cloud computing has provided an attractive model for business service delivery. However, accountability aspects, mainly the monitoring of the execution of a service contract, liability assignment and dispute arbitration are still lacking. On the one hand, the traditional centralized monitoring and the trusted-third party (TTP) based arbitration solutions are not suitable for the distributed cloud environment. On the other hand, a decentralized solution also faces challenges in guaranteeing fairness, accuracy and sustainability. To address this issue, this paper firstly proposes an innovative service contract management scheme that facilitates the monitoring of the execution of a service contract in a peer-to-peer environment, inspired by the concept of blockchain in Bitcoin. Secondly, on top of the scheme it presents a novel dispute resolution protocol based on the Byzantine agreement and the commitment scheme. Thirdly, it identifies the optimal settings of the key parameters of the protocol through a set of experiments and scenario analysis, aiming to strike the balance of fairness, accuracy, incentive maximization for the honest arbiters and cost minimization for the overall arbitration process. With this approach, service participants can be held accountable in a truly distributed environment without the presence of a central authority, which increases businesses confidence on adopting cloud services.

ID MAJORITY
AB Bitcoin provides two incentives for miners: block rewards and transaction fees. The former accounts for the vast majority of miner revenues at the beginning of the system, but it is expected to transition to the latter as the block rewards dwindle. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the block chain.
   We show that this is not the case. Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a "wealthy" block to "steal" the rewards therein. We show that this results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin's security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances. We also revisit selfish mining and show that it can be made profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, and who is arbitrarily poorly connected within the network. Our results are derived from theoretical analysis and confirmed by a new Bitcoin mining simulator that may be of independent interest.
   We discuss the troubling implications of our results for Bitcoin's future security and draw lessons for the design of new cryptocurrencies.

DE Authenticated Data Feeds; Smart Contracts; Trusted Hardware; Intel SGX;
   Ethereum; Bitcoin
AB Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.
   We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source -authenticated data to relying smart contracts.
   TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources.
   We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications.
   We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.

AB "Bitcoin is a rare case where practice seems to be ahead of theory." Joseph Bonneau et al. [3]
   This tutorial aims to further close the gap between IT security research and the area of cryptographic currencies and block chains. We will describe and refer to Bitcoin as an example throughout the tutorial, as it is the most prominent representative of such a system. It also is a good reference to discuss the underlying block chain mechanics which are the foundation of various altcoins and other derived systems. In this tutorial, the topic of cryptographic currencies is solely addressed from a technical IT security point-of-view. Therefore we do not cover any legal, sociological, financial or economical aspects.
   The tutorial is designed for participants with a solid IT security background but will not assume any prior knowledge on cryptographic currencies. Thus, we will quickly advance our discussion into core aspects of this field.
   This tutorial is a modified version of the tutorial held at WWW2016 [9]. It incorporates received feedback and customized content.

DE Bitcoin; Blockchain; Smart contracts; Blind signatures; Anonymity
AB Although Bitcoin is often perceived to be an anonymous currency, research has shown that a user's Bitcoin transactions can be linked to compromise the user's anonymity. We present solutions to the anonymity problem for both transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain and off the blockchain (in so called micropayment channel networks). We use an untrusted third party to issue anonymous vouchers which users redeem for Bitcoin. Blind signatures and Bitcoin transaction contracts (aka smart contracts) ensure the anonymity and fairness during the bitcoin. voucher exchange. Our schemes are practical, secure and anonymous.

AB In the setting of blockchain based transaction ledgers we study the problem of "simplified payment verification" (SPV) which refers to the setting of a transaction verifier that wishes to examine the last k blocks of the blockchain (e.g., for the purpose of verification of a certain transaction) using as only advice the genesis block (or some "checkpoint" block that is known to it).
   The straightforward solution to this task requires the delivery of the blockchain, the verification of the proof of work it contains, and subsequently the examination of the last k blocks. It follows that the communication required to complete this task is linear in the length of the chain.
   At first thought the above seems the best one can hope: a sublinear in the length of the chain solution to the problem will be susceptible to an attacker that, using precomputation, can fool the verifier.
   Contrary to this intuition, we show that with a suitable modification to the current Bitcoin blockchain protocol (that incurs a single hash expansion in each block and gives rise to the notion of an interconnected blockchain) we can produce proofs of proof of work with sublinear complexity in the length of the chain hence enabling SPV to be performed much more efficiently.

AB This paper presents an extension to Bitcoin's script language enabling covenants, a primitive that allows transactions to restrict how the value they transfer is used in the future. Covenants expand the set of financial instruments expressible in Bitcoin, and enable new powerful and novel use cases. We illustrate two novel security constructs built using covenants.
   The first, vaults, focuses on improving the security of private cryptographic keys. Historically, maintaining these keys securely and reliably has been a critical vulnerability for Bitcoin users. We show how covenants enable vaults, which disincentivize key theft by preventing an attacker from gaining full access to stolen funds.
   The second construct, poison transactions, is a generally useful mechanism for penalizing double-spending attacks. Bitcoin-NG, a protocol that has been recently proposed to improve Bitcoin's throughput, latency and overall scalability, requires this feature. We show how covenants enable poison transactions, and detail how Bitcoin-NG can be implemented progressively as an overlay on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

AB Several applications require robust and tamper-proof logging systems, e.g. electronic voting or bank information systems. At Scytl we use a technology, called immutable logs, that we deploy in our electronic voting solutions. This technology ensures the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of the generated logs, thus in case of any event the auditors can use them to investigate the issue. As a security recommendation it is advisable to store and/or replicate the information logged in a location where the logger has no writing or modification permissions. Otherwise, if the logger gets compromised, the data previously generated could be truncated or altered using the same private keys. This approach is costly and does not protect against collusion between the logger and the entities that hold the replicated data. In order to tackle these issues, in this article we present a proposal and implementation to immutabilize integrity proofs of the secure logs within the Bitcoin's blockchain. Due to the properties of the proposal, the integrity of the immutabilized logs is guaranteed without performing log data replication and even in case the logger gets latterly compromised.

AB The 'blockchain' is the core mechanism for the Bitcoin digital payment system. It embraces a set of inter-related technologies: the blockchain itself as a distributed record of digital events, the distributed consensus method to agree whether a new block is legitimate, automated smart contracts, and the data structure associated with each block. We propose a permanent distributed record of intellectual effort and associated reputational reward, based on the blockchain that instantiates and democratises educational reputation beyond the academic community. We are undertaking initial trials of a private blockchain or storing educational records, drawing also on our previous research into reputation management for educational systems.

CT 21st European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS)

AB One of the most promising innovations offered by the cryptographic currencies (like Bitcoin) are the so-called smart contracts, which can be viewed as financial agreements between mutually distrusting participants. Their execution is enforced by the mechanics of the currency, and typically has monetary consequences for the parties. The rules of these contracts are written in the form of so-called "scripts", which are pieces of code in some "scripting language". Although smart contracts are believed to have a huge potential, for the moment they are not widely used in practice. In particular, most of Bitcoin miners allow only to post standard transactions (i.e.: those without the non-trivial scripts) on the blockchain. As a result, it is currently very hard to create non-trivial smart contracts in Bitcoin.
   Motivated by this, we address the following question: "is it possible to create non-trivial efficient smart contracts using the standard transactions only?" We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing efficient Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment protocol for a large class of NP-relations. This includes the relations for which efficient sigma protocols exist. In particular, our protocol can be used to sell a factorization (p,q) of an RSA modulus n = pq, which is an example that we implemented and tested its efficiency in practice.
   As another example of the "smart contract without scripts" we show how our techniques can be used to implement the contract called "trading across chains".

AB Often, we wish to let parties alter or undo a contract that has been made. Toward this end, contract law has developed a set of traditional tools for altering and undoing contracts. Unfortunately, these tools often fail when applied to smart contracts. It is therefore necessary to define a new set of standards for the altering and undoing of smart contracts. These standards might ensure that the tools we use to alter and undo smart contracts achieve their original (contract law) goals when applied to this new technology. This paper develops such a set of standards and, then, to prove their worth as a framework, applies to them to an existing smart contract platform (Ethereum).

AB While procedural languages are commonly used to program smart contracts in blockchain systems, logic-based languages may be interesting alternatives. In this paper, we inspect what are the possible legal and technical (dis) advantages of logic-based smart contracts in light of common activities featuring ordinary contracts, then we provide insights on how to use such logic-based smart contracts in combination with blockchain systems. These insights lead us to emphasize a fundamental challenge - algorithms for logic approaches have to be efficient, but they also need to be literally cheap as measured within the environment where they are deployed and according to its economic rules. We illustrate this with different algorithms from defeasible logic-based frameworks.

AB Shared ledger technologies, as exemplified by Blockchain, provide a new framework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having a high-reliability, shared, trusted, privacy-preserving, nonrepudiable data repository that includes programmable logic in the form of "smart contracts". The framework has the potential to dramatically transform business collaboration across numerous industry sectors, including finance, supply chain, food production, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. Widespread adoption of this technology will be accelerated by the development of business-level languages for specifying smart contracts. This paper proposes that data-aware business processes, and in particular the Business Artifact paradigm, can provide a robust basis for a shared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL). The fundamental rationale for adopting data-aware processes is that shared ledgers focus on both data and process in equal measure. The paper examines potential advantages of the artifact-based approach from two perspectives: conceptual modeling, and opportunities for formal reasoning (verification). Broad research challenges for the development, understanding, and usage of a shared ledger BCL are highlighted.

AB Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, is a permissionless distributed database which allows distributed storage and computation over a large network of nodes. This technology has been applied recently to many other fields besides e-currencies (Bitcoin 2.0 projects). In this paper we present Betfunding: a blockchain-based decentralized crowdfunding platform. On the contrary of regular crowdfunding platforms, our system does not require a central and reliable organization. In Betfutding users bet whether the project will or will not be implemented in a given time frame, increasing the bounty and incentive for potential developers to carry it out.

AB Data sharing presents extensive opportunities and challenges in domains such as the public sector, health care and financial services. This paper introduces the concept of "trusted data marketplaces" as a mechanism for enabling trusted sharing of data. It takes credit scoring an essential mechanism of the entire world-economic environment, determining access for companies and individuals to credit and the terms under which credit is provisioned as an example for the realization of the trusted data marketplaces concept. This paper looks at credit scoring from a data perspective, analyzing current shortcomings in the use and sharing of data for credit scoring, and outlining a conceptual framework in terms of a trusted data marketplace to overcome the identified shortcomings. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) identify and discuss the core data issues that hinder innovation in credit scoring; (2) propose a conceptual architecture for trusted data marketplaces for credit scoring in order to serve as a reference architecture for the implementation of future credit scoring systems. The architecture is generic and can be adopted in other domains where data sharing is of high relevance.

AB The states of the United States operate parallel registration systems under the rules of the Uniform Commercial Code to provide notice of existing security interests in collateral to lenders. The current system is primarily a paper-based system more suited to the 19th than the 21st century. While the states have implemented varying degrees of computerization and modernization, dealing with fifty separate registration databases has made it difficult for banks and their attorneys to automate their processes, leading to errors and loss. The system could be modernized by storing the records for all 50 states in a single shared database with external electronic access. In this paper, we propose an implementation of a distributed, replicated database utilizing a variation on the Bitcoin blockchain for data storage and validation.

AB Client puzzles have been proposed as a mechanism for proving legitimate intentions by providing "proofs of work", which can be applied to discourage malicious usage of resources. A typical problem of puzzle constructions is the difference in expected solving time on different computing platforms. We call puzzles which can be solved independently of client computing resources fair client puzzles.
   We propose a construction for client puzzles requiring widely distributed computational effort for their solution. These puzzles can be solved using the mining process of Bitcoin, or similar cryptocurrencies. Adapting existing definitions, we show that our puzzle construction satisfies formal requirements of client puzzles under reasonable assumptions. We describe a way of transforming our client puzzles for use in denial of service scenarios and demonstrate a practical construction.

AB A new mechanism is proposed for securing a blockchain applied to contracts management such as digital rights management. This mechanism includes a new consensus method using a credibility score and creates a hybrid blockchain by alternately using this new method and proof-of-stake. This makes it possible to prevent an attacker from monopolizing resources and to keep securing blockchains.

AB We study the strategic considerations of miners participating in the bitcoin's protocol. We formulate and study the stochastic game that underlies these strategic considerations. The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.

AB The morphological changes in giant spherical vesicles comprised of amphilhilic poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid), PMAA-b-P(MMA-r-MAA), by incorporation of the 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SpMA) into the hydrophilic PMAA block chains were investigated. The vesicles were reduced in size as the SpMA ratio increased due to the variation in the critical packing shape by the expansion of the hydrophilic surface area by the incorporation of the more hydrophilic ionic segments. The increase in the SpMA ratio also delayed the transition from the spherical vesicles to a film-like bilayer. The giant vesicles containing the SpMA segments were disrupted into a nonspecific form by the electrostatic interaction with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) at a 2.5 M ratio of the unit for the allylamine hydrochloride (AH) to the SpMA. A large excess of the AH/SpMA above 5.0 caused no disruption, but partial fusion of the vesicles accompanied by a decrease in size.

DE Block chain; Credit rating; Credit model
AB Credit rating refers to the debtor's ability and willingness to repay debt. The scheduled principal and interest are evaluated by any independent third-party credit rating agency with a set of simple rating symbols indicating the risk of default and the loss severity. The exact credit rating and the widely recognized credit rating indices are important for all investors, issuers, national regulatory authorities, and even the national economy. For example, the credit ratings of Standard &Poor, Moody's, and Fitch are significan tand sufficient to dominate the stock markets worldwide.
   The reliance of Standard & Poor, Moody's, and Fitch (the three leading credit rating agencies or" the Big Three") on the inherent advantages of the Wall Street financial markets and their sustained fair ratings for over a hundred years has built their credibility in the field. However, credibility does not guarantee absolute fairness of their credit ratings. During financial crises, any improper credit rating by the Big Three may greatly cause a negative effect on investors and the economy. The current model and process of credit rating require effective supervision and substantial improvement.
   In this article, a new credit rating process is proposed on the basis of the block chain technology. This new mode of operation is mainly applied through block chain encryption and some unalterable properties to abolish the credit intermediary functions of rating agencies. Using data encryption technology, the business data privacy being evaluated, the rating models, and the rating agencies' methods can be effectively protected. Furthermore, based on the mechanism of multiple copies of accounting books and public voting, these data may not be arbitrarily tampered. Thus, an open and transparent rating process is ensured, and the emergence of improper ratings due to the exchange of interests between the rating agencies and the units being rated or to be rated is avoided.
