TI Applying Modern, Disruptive Technologies to Improve the Effectiveness of
   Tax Treaty Dispute Resolution: Part 2
SO INTERTAX
LA English
DT Article
AB In Part 1 of this article, the authors analysed the main drawbacks of the existing tax treaty dispute resolution process and considered the fundamental features of the main types of disruptive technology. keeping in mind how they could improve this process.
   In this part. the authors make some specific suggestions as to how the analysed technologies tan be used to improve the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) and supplementary solutions. This will include the use of video conferencing to cut costs and speed up resolution (section 2); electronic filing and checking of the MAP request with respect to documentation requirements (section 3); automatic notification as regards the deadline before arbitration is triggered and automatic forwarding of the request and any supplementary information to the other competent authority(ies): automatic notification of the taxpayer of each material step taken in the resolution of the case (without providing access to secure data); communication and exchange of information between competent authorities via secure electronic means in real time; and information storage in secure shared-data platforms (i.e. controlled aims) allowing access to competent authorities and even to the arbitral panel, where required (section 3); the use of data analytics to cluster cases by type, allowing for easier center dot inventory management. and to generate risk profiles that could help in both the prevention of MAP cases and the speedier resolution thereof (section 4): the use of artificial intelligence to review past eases, thereby allowing easier assignment to case workers, depending on their schedule, and thus, easier and more timely solutions based on precedents (maim 5); and the use of blockchain to validate transactions and information and to remove the need for trust, thus allowing for an easier and quicker resolution, especially in multilateral cases (section 6).
   Finally, the author's proposal posits that due to communication requirements, costs and security considerations, the implementation of technology solutions requires a global, coordinated approach, which should be spearheaded and managed by international organizations such as the OECD and the UN. The implementation could be completed in several stages and be subject to peer reviews.

TI A Blockchain-Based Contractual Routing Protocol for the Internet of
   Things Using Smart Contracts
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
ID SECURE; PROOF
AB In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based contractual routing (BCR) protocol for a network of untrusted IoT devices. In contrast to conventional secure routing protocols in which a central authority (CA) is required to facilitate the identification and authentication of each device, the BCR protocol operates in a distributed manner with no CA. The BCR protocol utilizes smart contracts to discover a route to a destination or data gateway within heterogeneous IoT networks. Any intermediary device can guarantee a route from a source IoT device to a destination device or gateway. We compare the performance of BCR with that of the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in a network of 14 devices. The results show that the routing overhead of the BCR protocol is 5 times lower compared to AODV at the cost of a slightly lower packet delivery ratio. BCR is fairly resistant to both Blackhole and (keyhole attacks. The results show that the BCR protocol enables distributed routing in heterogeneous IoT networks.

AB Blockchain, a distributed secure digital ledger technology, is a relatively recent development with potentially transformational implications for economy and society. Its specific characteristics enable new decentralized models of distributed and trusted transactions. This position paper explores the implications of blockchain for collaborative networked organizations. In particular we aim at understanding the implications for companies in various economic sectors, and how new forms of networked organizations and new business models will be enabled. We also will focus on enablers of blockchain innovations, in particular with respect to governance of blockchain-based platforms and business networks. The paper results in a discussion of research challenges in the field of blockchain-enabled collaborative networked organizations.

DE world economy; financial system; Bitcoin; sustainable development
AB Structural changes in the world economy require a constant increase in investment flows. The main factor that determines the presence or absence of resources to finance investment processes is the amount of money in circulation. In this regard, in recent decades, the world financial system has been increasingly faced with the issue of the money supply increase. The process of increasing the currency in circulation should not get out of control; it has to satisfy the needs of world economy sustainable development and at the same time ensure the stability of the international financial markets functioning. Thus, today the issue of finding an international payment facility that would ensure the sustainable development of the world economy on the basis of a controlled growth of the money supply in circulation is an acute one. The way to solve the problem of the money in circulation optimization can be found in so-called cryptographic currencies, the leader among which nowadays is Bitcoin.
   The purpose of this study is to find the answer to the question: "Can Bitcoin's usage as an international means of payment be a way to solve the issue of the money in circulation optimization in order to maintain sustainable development of the world economy?" The study is based on an analysis of the statistical data available at The World Bank, Blockchain Luxembourg SA, MS Brokers Europe Limited. The methodology of the analysis is based on the use of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, comparative and trend analysis elements.

DE Augmented Reality; Internet of Things; Smart Education; Serious Gaming
AB Technology advancements nowadays like the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Cloud Technology, Mobile Internet, 3/4D printing, etc. have the potential to add significant business value and make daily life more convenient and enriching. Talking about the future of the society with imagination, innovation, inspiration, interaction, interconnection and improvement, this is a new paradigm pushing from the pillars of education that needs to be agreed and adapted to the reality of each environment, preventing breaks and digital divides in access to knowledge and technologies that impoverish citizens and therefore to society. A smart city is an urban development vision to integrate multiple information and communication technology and Internet of Things solutions in a secure fashion to manage a city's assets. The smart education is one of the main segments with biggest impact in the smart environment. To cover this high tech new scenario there is a huge demand of new research, profiles and skills. The future framework for smart digital education, leave permanently redefined from the impact of new technologies, experiences and case studies from a more interconnected perspective. AR is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike VR, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR enhanced by IoT Data uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. This new technology blurs the line between what is real and what is computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell. The present paper aims to present the current state of the art of AR used in smart digital education, the most relevant opportunities and technical limitations as well as the challenges of building AR applications enhanced by the IoT Data and AI features with the risks and rewards. A considerable amount of research has been focused on AR usage in education. However, the educational advantages and related utilities of AR have only recently been explored in detail. Therefore, a review of advantages and challenges reported in research studies on AR technology in education can usefully suggest both best practices and areas in which to invest future research and development, so that this technology may be employed to its maximum capacity. The paper is structured as follows. After a short introduction into the concepts of smart education and AR, Section 2 presents in brief the methodology used. Section 3 discusses converging of the mixed reality technology with the IoT. Section 4 outlines the main findings of the global AR in education market research analysis, where the analysts predict the CAGR growth of more than 82% by 2021. Section 5 outlines the top three trends in AR that impact education in terms of AR textbooks, AR gaming and student-centric smart digital environments. Section 6 is focused on advantages, disadvantages and challenges of using the augmented reality for education. In Conclusions are drawn future research directions.

AB The network-centric world of the 21st century and explosive growth of the internet related technologies brought modern cybersecurity culture with complex threat landscape in the Higher Education environment. Cybersecurity landscape is always changing and education providers often do not have remit or in fact the means and capacity to cover the range of activities learners engage with, which attest their achievements, knowledge, and skills. Currently the awarding and validation of qualifications occurs exclusively under centralised management of an education institution or an employer take more ownership of the learning experience and its outcomes without compromising on safety, security, and accessibility. The centralised model of the present awarding and validation is no longer sustainable because learning happens increasingly on online platforms, and learning is far more international than it used to be. Key higher educational providers introduced degree apprenticeships which are new way to 'do both' higher level skills and provide progression routes to improve their employability prospects.
   The 'Blockchain' (BC) facilitates digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It embraces a set of inter-related technologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for transform centralised model of awarding and validation in to decentralized ledger of secured database. This database is shared, replicated, and synchronized for validation among the universities, partner institutions, professionals, statutory or regulatory bodies and industry bodies across the internet. The architecture offers secured collaborative validating system by qualification exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology.

TI THE DISTRIBUTED LIABILITY OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS: LEGAL RISKS OF
   BLOCKCHAIN
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTRACTS; LAW
AB The transformative potential of distributed ledger technology ("DLT"), especially in the financial sector, is attracting enormous interest. Many financial institutions are investing heavily in proof-of-concept demonstrations and the rollout of pilot applications of DLT technology. Part of the attraction of distributed ledger systems such as Blockchain lies in transcending law and regulation. From a technological perspective, DLT is generally seen as offering unbreakable security, immutability, and unparalleled transparency, making law and regulation unnecessary. Yet while the law may be dull and the technology exciting, the impact of the law cannot be simply wished away. With data distributed among many ledgers, legal risk remains. DLT projects may well be found by courts to constitute joint ventures, with liability spread across all owners and operators of systems serving as distributed ledgers. Instead of being subject to law nowhere, organizers may instead be subject to the law wherever there are system users. Regulators seeking to support appropriate approaches to twenty-first century financial infrastructure must focus on these legal consequences.

AB We are living in the era of information technology. Our day to day life is heavily dependent on it and hence it's safe and secure functioning become very crucial and important. Every minute, there are thousands of cyber-attacks taking place around the world. Attackers are continuously evolving sophisticated and stealthy techniques to target the victim. They takes all the precautionary measures to remove attack traces such as system logs and related information on the victim systems so that they cannot be traced back. Attackers intentionally spread their activities over longer period of time to evade detection. To understand and identify such complex attack, it is required to maintain a secure log records over extended time period. However, preserving the log records for longer time is challenging issue. The system should also ensure the integrity of log files and logging process. In order to overcome these issues, in this paper we are proposing a secure log storage using Blockchain on Cloud platform. Blockchain technology will help to create tamper-proof audit logs. It provides proof of log manipulation and non-repudiation. Cloud platform makes the overall system scalable and support for deep analysis.

AB Blockchain uses the idea of storing transaction data in the form of a distributed ledger wherein each node in the network stores a current copy of the sequence of transactions (ledger) in the form of a hash chain. Storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks. In this work we use secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to design a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of each transaction thereby reducing storage cost to a fraction of the original. When further using dynamic zone allocation, we show the coding scheme can also improve the data integrity.

ID KEY MANAGEMENT SCHEME
AB Data explosion has raised a scalability challenge to cloud storage management, while spinning disk capacity growth rates will continue to slow down. Major data holders such as cloud storage providers with a heavy reliance on disk as a storage medium will need to orchestrate multiple kinds of storage to better manage their relentless data growth.
   In this paper, we first explore the scenario that multiple clouds are driven by interests to make the storage resources efficiently allocated without requiring a trusted third party, and then propose a novel model, called CloudShare, to enable multi-clouds to carry out a transparent encrypted data deduplication among cross-users via blockchain. Our scheme significantly reduces the storage costs of each cloud, and saves the upload bandwidth of users, while ensuring data confidentiality and consistency. We demonstrate via simulations on a realistic datasets that CloudShare achieves both the effectiveness and the efficiency.

DE blockchain; food chain management; institutional economics
AB Blockchain became known as the technology underlying the cryptocurrency bitcoin. While here this technology has received quite controversial attention, its proponents expect much more promising applications in other fields. One of these concerns food-chain management, where it is said to have the potential to revolutionise it. This paper looks at this case from an institutional economic perspective. For this, it first clarifies how a straight application of this technology matches basic microeconomic thinking, as restricted to private goods and prices, and thus also the market optimism associated with it. The paper then analyses the role of institutions in the food system as it has so far been organised and how this institutional setting might be changed in order to incorporate this new technology while safeguarding the objective of an overall economic optimum. In order to sketch out some ways in which these conceptual considerations might actually be put to the test, a cursory introduction is given to some options relating to the situation in Romania. Some orientation might thereby be provided for further work.

DE International North-South Transportation Corridor; Digital Technologies;
   India; Russia; Azerbaijan; Iran
AB At present, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is being widely discussed among policy makers and academia as on the ground progress is fast taking shape. The project has primarily remained an initiative of four major participating states - i.e. India, Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia that are territorially located along the route of the corridor. Private businesses, whether local companies or multinational corporations, have not been very interested to jointly develop the project, mostly out of their concerns for assured returns on investments. The study builds a comprehensive case for the participating states to actively engage the private companies for developing the mega-connectivity project. The latter holds an advantage over advanced digital technologies in the global markets. Hence, public-private partnerships will bring about application of advanced digital technologies, like IoT, Blockchain technology, etc., which will efficiently serve the needs of different activities happening along the entire length of the corridor. This, in turn, will increase the overall strength and utility of the corridor. thereby ensuring its lasting success.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted increasing attention in recent years. One reason for this new trend is the introduction of on-chain smart contracts enabling the implementation of decentralized applications in trust-less environments. Along with its adoption, attacks exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities are inevitably growing. To counter these attacks and avoid breaches, several approaches have been explored such as documenting vulnerabilities or model checking using formal verification. However, these approaches fail to capture the blockchain and users behavior properties. In this paper, we propose a novel formal modeling approach to verify a smart contract behavior in its execution environment. We apply this formalism on a concrete smart contract example and analyze its breaches with a statistical model checking approach.

AB One of the most popular platform based on blockchain technology is Ethereum. Internal activity on this public blockchain is analyzed both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. In a first part, it is shown that the creation of the Ethereum Alliance consortium has been a game changer in the use of the technology. In a second part, the network robustness against attacks is investigated from a graph point of view, as well as the distribution of internal activity among users. Addresses of great influence were identified, and allowed to formulate conjectures on the current usage of this technology.

AB Nowadays, vehicles odometer fraud is becoming a growing problem internationally, and is costing European consumers between (sic)5.6 to (sic)9.6 billion per year. This is partly due to the lack of unified vehicles life-cycle management, and to the fact that vehicles data are currently spread across multiple stakeholders that do not trust each other or collaborate together. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-backed Vehicles Data and Processes Ledger framework to streamline the management of vehicles life-cycle and data history, and hence to provide more transparency and collaborations between the involved stakeholders. The architecture and lessons learned from the first implementation phase are discussed, followed by future research challenges.

AB Blockchain technology and the application of smart contracts allow for automation of verifiable digital processes between any number of parties. The Internet of Things (loT) has seen great potential in the past decade to revolutionise our day-to-day lives with the aim of automating physical processes by incorporating Internet-connected devices into commodities. By integrating the IoT with blockchain systems and smart contracts it is passible to provide verifiable automation of physical processes involving different parties. The challenge lies in that due to resource constraints, many of the computational devices used within the IoT are not capable of directly interacting with blockchain implementations. In this paper, we describe and give a reference design and implementation of a split-virtual machine, AlkylVM, which allows for resource constrained loT devices to interact with blockchain systems.

AB As proof-of-work blockchains are inherently energy greedy and offer probabilistic guarantees, blockchains based on Byzantine consensus appear as a promising technology to track billions of connected devices. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of prominent blockchains that solve the classic Byzantine consensus problem. Our results show that while offering reasonable throughput their performance usually do not scale to tens of devices and drops dramatically as the number of devices increases. This study motivates the need for solutions that solves the Blockchain consensus problem, a scalable variant of the classic Byzantine consensus problem but dedicated to blockchains.

AB This paper aims at showing a conceptual approach for security and traceability of shared information in the process of transportation of dangerous goods. Concerning the transport of dangerous goods, the process generates particular information, which is necessary to share with the stakeholders involved in this process. This information is considered sensitive, because it may contain the timestamp of movement of goods, information related to the goods, contractual business details, etc., and unauthorized parties should not access them. At any level, the process should remain transparent between stakeholders', with immutable properties on data sharing and the whole process should be auditable. We examine a general procedure for contractual issues for transportation of dangerous goods between stakeholders and its conceptual implementation by blockchain based on smart contracts.

AB Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (CITS) enables inter-networking of vehicles for alerts exchanging in order to improve road safety. While this technology is about to enter the market in the upcoming years, critical questions related to the communication security continue to be challenging research concerns. Current solutions to secure inter-vehicle communication depend mainly on the use of digital certificates for authentication. However, such an approach imposes significant overhead on vehicles since it is computationally demanding and requires validation of the certificate within a limited period. In addition, relying on a central node for deciding on issuing and revoking certificates introduces a single point of failure and could even risk the safety of motorists. In this paper, we propose the use of Blockchain to keep track of the certificate of each vehicle (valid or revoked) in distributed and immutable records. In essence we replace certificate verification with a lightweight blockchain-based authentication approach. In addition, we propose a fully distributed vehicle admission/revocation scheme. We show that our scheme could alleviate the computation overhead and enhance the response time while improving the overall system security.

DE Blockchain; Archiving documents; Regulatory compliance; Protocol
AB Blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and their respective P2P networks have seen significant adoption in many sectors in the past few years. All these technologies that use the Blockchain pattern show that it is possible to rebuild any transactional system with better performance without relying on any trusted parties to manage transactions between peers. This insight has lead many companies to invest millions to understand the technology and to find a way to migrate from centralized to decentralized solutions.
   These solutions need to store large amounts of data in a secure and confidential way. Many distributed storage systems now exist using Blockchain technology. But none of the tools proposed are able to manage the document life cycle nor archive documents based on regulatory compliance.
   In this paper, we describe our protocol named NFB (Notarizing Files over the Blockchain). This protocol ensures the communication between two systems: a permissive Blockchain and a secured centralized archiving document management system. The method described is used to allow users to archive, control, analyze and validate their transactions in a system that offers confidentiality, security and distribution features.

DE Blockchain; bitcoin; light nodes; block summarization
AB Blockchains have revolutionized the storage of data in an immutable, transparent and non-centralized way. However, public blockchain systems like the Bitcoin system face a problem of scalability, primarily due to the significant and growing size of its blockchain. This paper introduces a method, termed block summarization, which reduces blockchain storage overhead for systems having transferable transactions. The proposed method allows resource-restricted light nodes to store a form of the blockchain such that it can validate the transactions independently which ultimately reduce dependency on full nodes. This way, we can achieve a middle ground between Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes which can only verify the membership of a transaction in the blockchain, and full nodes with pruning enabled which can only support pruning provided they have an infrastructure of full nodes. We implemented our algorithm for a custom blockchain using Bitcoin blocks and were able to achieve a compression ratio of 0.54.

AB In this work we propose a compression method for smart contracts deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. By taking advantage of the repetition of sections of bytecode among multiple smart contracts previously deployed in the Ethereum blockchain we propose a new pseudo opcode that acts as a pointer that will allow smart contracts to reuse previously deployed code.
   We show that our proposed algorithm achieves space savings of up to 75% in a dataset of deployed Ethereum smart contracts bytecode, on par with other state of the art compression algorithms while remaining compatible with other methods currently in use for space reduction.

AB We design a distributed platform with blockchain as a system service for supporting transaction execution in insurance processes. The insurance industry is heavily dependent on multiple processes between transacting parties for initiating, maintaining and closing diverse kind of policies. Transaction processing time, payment settlement time and security protection of the process execution are major concerns. Blockchain technology, originally conceived as an immutable distributed ledger for detecting double spending of cryptocurrencies, is now increasingly used in different FinTech systems to address productivity and security requirements. The application of blockchain in FinTech processing requires a deep understanding of the underlying business processes. It supports automated interactions between the blockchain and existing transaction systems through the notion of smart contracts. In this paper, we focus on the design of an efficient approach for processing insurance related transactions based on a blockchain-enabled platform. An experimental prototype is developed on Hyperledger fabric, an open source permissioned blockchain design framework. We discuss the main design requirements, corresponding design propositions, and encode various insurance processes as smart contracts. Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze performance of our framework and security of the proposed design.

AB Enterprises have paid attention to blockchain (BC), recently permissioned BC characterized with smart-contract, where business transactions among inter-authorized companies (forming consortium) can automatically be executed based on distributed consensus protocol over user-defined business logics pre-built with program codes. A single BC system will be built across multiple management domains having different operational policies, e.g., datacenter of each organization; this will trigger a problem that its system operations (e.g., backup) will become time-consuming and costly due to the difficulty in unifying and/or adjusting operational policy, schedule, etc. Toward solving the problem, we propose an operations execution method for BC systems; a primary idea is to define operations as smart-contract so that unified and synchronized cross-organizational operations can be executed effectively by using BC-native features. We design the proposed method as hybrid architecture including in-BC consensus establishment and out-BC event-based instruction execution, in order to be adaptable to the recent heterogeneous BC architecture. Performance evaluation using a prototype with Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 shows that the proposed method can start executing operations within 5 seconds. Furthermore, cost evaluation using model-based estimation shows that the total yearly cost of monthly operations on a 5-organizational BC system could be reduced by 61 percent compared to a conventional manual method.

AB Real-world smart contracts which preserve the privacy of both, their users and their data, have barely been proposed theoretically, let alone been implemented practically. In this paper, we are the first to implement a privacy-preserving protocol from the energy domain as a smart contract in Ethereum. We elaborate on and present our implementation as well as our practical findings, including more or less subtle traps and pitfalls. Despite major optimizations to our implementation, we find that while it is currently possible, it is not feasible to implement a privacy-preserving protocol of modest complexity in the Ethereum blockchain due to the high cost of operation and the lack of privacy by design.

AB Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrency systems, especially Ethereum. It permits complex financial transactions or rules through scripts, which is called smart contracts. Since Ethereum smart contracts hold millions of dollars, their execution correctness is crucial against attacks which aim at stealing the assets. In this paper, we proposed a security assurance method for smart contract source code to find potential security risks. It contains two main functions, the first is syntax topological analysis of smart contract invocation relationship, to help developers to understand their code structure clearly; the second is logic risk (which may lead to vulnerabilities) detection and location, and label results on topology diagram. For developers' convenience, we have built a static analysis tool called SASC to generate topology diagram of invocation relationship and to find potential logic risks. We have made an evaluation on 2,952 smart contracts, experiment results proved that our method is intuitive and effective.

AB Chemical companies must find new paths to success in a changing environment. In particular, this will involve exploiting the potential of digital technologies. However, the full integration and intelligent interconnection of systems and processes is only making slow progress. This contribution aims to encourage the more comprehensive use of digitization in the process industry based on smart sensors, actuators, and communications, and informs about current technical possibilities such as the "one-network paradigm", ad-hoc connections, edge computing, FPGAs, virtual machines and blockchain. These offer a new scope for smart sensors, actuators, and communications.

AB Blockchain is a data structure of data blocks arranged in chronological order. It is featured by decentralization, trustworthiness, data sharing, security, etc. It has been widely used in digital currency, smart contract, credit encryption and other fields. With the development of the Internet technology, online education, a novel education mode, has been greatly popularized. However, this education mode still faces many problems in course credibility, credit and certificate certification, student privacy, and course sharing. Through literature review and case analysis, this paper discusses the basic technical principles and application features of blockchain technology, and proposes a solution to the problems of online education based on blockchain technology. The blockchain technology can store learning records in a trusted, distributed manner, provide credible digital certificates, realize learning resource sharing with smart contract, and protect intellectual property through data encryption. The research shows that the integration of blockchain technology is a promising trend in the development of online education.

AB Cash-less payment via a variety of credit, debit or prepaid cards is pervasive in our interconnected society, but not so ubiquitous in remote rural regions where network connectivity is intermittent. We proposed a cash-less payment scheme for remote villages based on blockchains that allow maintaining a record of verifiable transactions in a distributed manner. We overcome the limitations of intermittent network connectivity by solely relying on blockchain mining nodes in the village for transaction processing and verification. The bank joins as a peer and monitors node behaviors, rewards miners and processes currency exchanges whenever the connectivity is available. We take advantage of the Ethereum network to develop our solution and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system on off-the-shelf computing devices. We emulate a remote village scenario with intermittent network connectivity and show the robustness and reliability of the proposed system.

DE Blockchain; Data privacy; Smart contract; Data consent
AB Current methods for obtaining data consent from legal guardians are limited to paper forms and human data entry. While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing 'smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party after-school intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts. These data consent signatures allow researchers the ability to design targeted inventions, meeting the needs of the community.

AB Contracts, a set of legally negotiated rules between the transacting parties are often the prime cause of legal as well as business disputes. Due to this discord, they are generally viewed with contempt. The need to revolutionize contracts has been much felt by the attorneys and the business professionals, so as to avoid these daedal contract conflicts. This resulted in the advent of smart contracts that was led by Blockchain technology. It is a blend of legalese from lawyers and computer code. A smart contract is a versatile system capable of facilitating, automating and enforcing an agreement (i.e. contract). In this paper, we preview as well as analyze smart contract based on blockchain technology for a decentralized system.

TI MONEY LAUNDERING AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY IN HONG KONG
SO HONG KONG LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Distributed ledger technology (DLT) or "blockchain" has received enormous attention from the finance industry. In general, DLT is a decentralised platform that enables transactions or information to be sent over the Internet from one party to another without the involvement of a central authority. It allows users to securely transact without knowing or trusting their counterparty. While commercially ground breaking, DLT challenges conventional regulation of money laundering and terrorist financing. Recently, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a whitepaper on DLT. The whitepaper states that the anonymity of users and the decentralisation of distributed ledgers could raise the risk of money laundering. It also states that these issues might be effectively addressed through a permissioned distributed ledger where participants are identified and authorised. This article expands on HKMA's suggestion by arguing a "consortium-based" approach because it achieves some of the money-laundering protections required under Hong Kong statutory frameworks, while retaining some of the technology's disruptive characteristics.

AB Privacy-preserving outsourcing algorithms for feature extraction not only reduce users' storage and computation overhead but also preserve the image privacy. However, the existing schemes still suffer from deficiencies induced by security, applications, efficiency and storage. To solve the problems, we implement a consortium chain-based outsourcing feature extraction scheme over encrypted images by using the smart contract, distributed autonomous corporation (DAC), sharding technique, and device to device (D2D) communication, which is secure, widely applied, highly efficient, and has less storage overhead. First, the effectiveness, security, and performance of our scheme are analyzed. Then, the efficiency and storage overhead of our scheme are presented by conducting experimental results.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention in both academia and capital market. However, overwhelming speculations on thousands of available cryptocurrencies and numerous initial coin offering scams have also brought notorious debates on this emerging technology. This paper traces the development of blockchain systems to reveal the importance of decentralized applications (dApps) and the future value of blockchain. We survey the state-of-the-art dApps and discuss the direction of blockchain development to fulfill the desirable characteristics of dApps. The readers will gain an overview of dApp research and get familiar with recent developments in the blockchain.

DE Blockchain; design comparison; DSO requirements; energy community
AB Energy communities and peer-to-peer energy exchanges are expected to play an important role in the energy transition. In this context, the blockchain approach can be employed to foster this decentralized energy market. Our goal is to determine the design that should allow a Distribution System Operator (DSO) to accept peer-to-peer energy exchanges based on a distributed ledger supported by the blockchain technology. To this end, we will evaluate several designs based on criteria such as acceptance of the wholesale/retail market, the resilience of the consensus to approve a block, the accuracy, traceability, privacy and security of the proposed schemes.

AB The two major roadblocks for state of the art Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure like smart buildings, smart cities, etc. are lack of trust between various entities of system and single point of failure which is a vulnerability causing extreme damage to the whole system. This paper proposes a blockchain based IoT security solution where, trust is established through the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain. The distributed nature of blockchain makes the system more robust and immune to single point of failure. We propose a mechanism to establish continuous security in the system by evaluating legitimate presence of user in valid IoT-Zone continuously without user intervention. Every user interaction in an IoT environment is stored in blockchain as a transaction and series of these transactions represent a user's IoT-trail. A unique digital crypto-token is required for a user interaction to be legitimate. This token is used as an access control mechanism to prevent any unauthorized access to the system. Tokens are pre-generated using a prediction model based on user's IoT-trail in the blockchain. By using blockchain as an underlying framework in IoT environment and through the method of continuous security, we made the system more secure, robust and interoperable.

AB Future smart vehicles will employ automotive over-the-air updates to update the soft ware in the embedded electronic control units. The update process can affect the safety of the involved users, thus requires a comprehensive and elaborate security architecture ensuring the confidentiality and the integrity of the exchanged data, as well as protecting the privacy of the involved users. In this paper, we propose an automotive security architecture employing Blockchain to tackle the implicated security and privacy challenges. We describe our proof-of-concept implementation of a Blockchain-based software update system, use it to show the applicability of our architecture for automotive systems, and evaluate different aspects of our architecture.

AB Increasingly, digital platforms are built into the value chain, acting as an intermediary between the manufacturer and the consumer. The paper presents tendencies and features of business model transformation in connection with management of the new digital technologies. The limitations of traditional business models and the capabilities of business models based on digital platforms and self-organization were revealed. In the study, the viability of the new business model for the dental industry was confirmed and the new concept of the branch self-organizing control system based on the information platform, blockchain, cryptocurrency and reward of target consumer is offered, including mechanisms that make the model attractive for both the consumer and the service provider.

TI Applying Modern, Disruptive Technologies to Improve the Effectiveness of
   Tax Treaty Dispute Resolution: Part 1
SO INTERTAX
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK
AB This comprehensive two-part article addresses how modern, disruptive technologies can be used to improve the effectiveness of tax treaty dispute resolution.
   It is clear that international tax dispute resolution needs improvement. The OECD, the European Union and the United Nations have all recently taken measures to this effect by promoting the prevention and timely resolution of treaty-related disputes. However, none of these recommendations considers technology.
   In this context, this article examines whether the emergence of new and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, shared-data platforms, cloud-based solutions and blockchain could complement the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) and supplementary arbitration and render them more effective by speeding up the resolution, reducing costs and establishing trust between tax administrations and taxpayers.
   To answer this question, in Part 1 of this article, the authors briefly analyse the main drawbacks of the existing tax treaty dispute resolution process from the perspective of various stakeholders. Next, the article focuses on the fundamental features of a few significant types of technology and analyses how they could improve this process.
   In Part 2 of this article, the authors will use the analysis from Part 1 to make some specific suggestions as to how the technologies discussed can be used to improve the MAP and supplementary solutions, with an aim to encourage the above-mentioned policy organizations to consider the potential of disruptive technologies in their work.

AB The MicroGrid, as the need for renewable energy emerges, are becoming essential, renewable energy trading platforms are being developed and established in the microgrid. With the proliferation of technologies such as Smart home based of Internet of Things, interconnected networks, and Blockchain, microgrid has introduced a variety of applications and innovative solutions for efficient system maintenance. This paper, in a blockchain-based smart home, it is impossible to forge data called transaction generated by using blockchain. With this unforgeable transactions, home miner that centrally processes all the transactions generated in smart home know information about energy. Based on this information, we proposes renewable energy trading platform using ethereum's smart contract to ensure secure energy trading run automatically without the third party intervention in a microgrid.

DE advertising; blockchain; marketing; campaign analytics
AB Internet advertising is facing increasing challenges, whichforces companies and brands to raise awareness of the importance of the userexperience. Aggravating advertising circumstances are represented by omnipresent fraudulent campaign execution reports, high consumer disapproval for current internet advertising models, various types of hacker attacks through internet ads, and the like. All this entails distrust of the company by the quality, reach and influence of advertising on the internet.
   This paper will show the way of online marketing analytics presentation that was conducted in one Slavonian informative internet portal. In addition, it will show the issues arising from creating an analytics of running campaign that would be more transparent, clearer and simpler to measure.
   The research methodology consists of: (1) analysing the collected transactional data from an ad server, and (2) analysing the amount of data transferred regarding the displayed ads. This analysis is designed to study the proportion of useful content for a user with respect to marketing related content and the content that reduces the quality of overall user experience.
   Conclusion of data analysis shows that the current technology on which the advertising industry is based, faces increasing problems. Tosolve these problems, it is necessary to significantly change the way the user perceives advertising and to take advantage of other technologies and manage user attention.
   Keeping in mind the problems mentioned above, the vision and opportunities of online marketing will be highlighted with an emphasis on blockchain technology. Blockchain, a new technology known as the basis for the development of crypto currencies, also offers many other innovative solutions and services with added value in all industries, including marketing. Blockchain has the technological potential to decentralize existing advertising patterns, from which users (consumers), publishers (authors, content creators, influencers) and advertisers (brands) can benefit.
   The paper will show the effects of blockchain technology on online advertising processes and the expected models of further development of advertising and marketing industries based on distributed applications and innovative solutions offered by this technology.

AB Blockchain, the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is gaining so much attention from different industry stakeholders, governments and research communities. Its application is extending beyond cryptocurrencies and has been exploited in different domains such as finance, E-commerce, Internet of Things (MT), healthcare, and governance. Some key attributes of the technology are decentralization, immutability, security and transparency. This paper aims to describe how permissioned Blockchain can be applied to a specific educational use case - decentralized verification of academic credentials. The proposed Blockchain-based solution, named 'CredenceLedger', is a system that stores compact data proofs of digital academic credentials in Blockchain ledger that are easily verifiable for education stakeholders and interested third party organizations.

AB Distributed Ledger (DL) has gained huge attention in the last years and will shift the conduction of business in the future. Until today, because of the great dynamics in the field a systematic approach to structure and define the field of DL does not exist. This led to a heterogeneous landscape of DL definitions and thus, misleading discussions.
   This paper gives a systematic overview of principles relevant to understand and structure the DL field. Furthermore, based on this it describes DL concepts and shows examples of protocols. The result can then be used for further research but also as a basis for successful collaborations in the field of DL.

AB Within "Industrie 4.0" approach 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB Albeit the primary usage of Bitcoin is to exchange currency, its blockchain and consensus mechanism can also be exploited to securely execute some forms of smart contracts. These are agreements among mutually distrusting parties, which can be automatically enforced without resorting to a trusted intermediary. Over the last few years a variety of smart contracts for Bitcoin have been proposed, both by the academic community and by that of developers. However, the heterogeneity in their treatment, the informal (often incomplete or imprecise) descriptions, and the use of poorly documented Bitcoin features, pose obstacles to the research. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of smart contracts on Bitcoin, in a uniform framework. Our treatment is based on a new formal specification language for smart contracts, which also helps us to highlight some subtleties in existing informal descriptions, making a step towards automatic verification. We discuss some obstacles to the diffusion of smart contracts on Bitcoin, and we identify the most promising open research challenges.

AB Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed.
   In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.

AB Blockchain-based distributed computing platforms enable the trusted execution of computation-defined in the form of smart contracts-without trusted agents. Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design nonfixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality.

AB The trend in the energy market has led in the last few years the increase in demand (eg the spread of electric vehicles) and an increase in volatile renewable energy sources (PV, Wind, etc.), a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, that destabilize the grid leading to black outs.
   The electricity grid is developing in a distributed network, so the connected energy markets are moving towards a new decentralized structure, where renewable sources and storage facilities (EVs), will have a significant penetration and adoption by energy customers, with the intent to provide sustainable solutions.[1]
   Balancing the demand and supply of electricity, in a system dominated by random elements, such as solar and wind production that depend on weather conditions, combined with the highly variable demand from domestic users, must lead to a new model of consumers and producers at the same time that is the so-called Prosumer and will be a challenge of great importance.
   With this paper we want to verify how the smart communities, made up of Prosumers, within smart cities, are the key to the new electricity distribution, based on ICT, IoT and smart metering. A significant contribution will be provided by the Blockchain to make the energy networks and related economic transactions secure and reliable.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, it has gained a significant popularity around the world. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data structure named the block-chain. Based on a fully decentralized network, the blockchain is maintained by a community of participants. In Bitcoin system, mining is the fundamental concept. In this paper, we design a new Bitcoin mining scheme based on the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model. To effectively implement the peer-to-peer relationship of Bitcoin system agents, we assume that mining pool operators are leaders and mining participating users are followers in our Stackelberg game. By using the dynamics of feedback-based repeated process, leaders, and followers can be interacting with one another and make their decisions in a way to reach an efficient system solution. Without the influence of any central authorities and organizations, the proposed method is practically applied to a distributed Bitcoin system. Through system level simulations, we show that our game approach outperforms the existing Bitcoin schemes in providing a better fair-efficient system performance.

AB We develop a generic game platform that can be used to model various real-world systems with multiple intelligent cloud-computing pools and parallel-queues for resources-competing users. Inside the platform, the software structure is modelled as Blockchain. All the users are associated with Big Data arrival streams whose random dynamics is modelled by triply stochastic renewal reward processes (TSRRPs). Each user may be served simultaneously by multiple pools while each pool with parallel-servers may also serve multi-users at the same time via smart policies in the Blockchain, e.g. a Nash equilibrium point myopically at each fixed time to a game-theoretic scheduling problem. To illustrate the effectiveness of our game platform, we model the performance measures of its internal data flow dynamics (queue length and workload processes) as reflecting diffusion with regime-switchings (RDRSs) under our scheduling policies. By RDRS models, we can prove our myopic game-theoretic policy to be an asymptotic Pareto minimal-dual-cost Nash equilibrium one globally over the whole time horizon to a randomly evolving dynamic game problem. Iterative schemes for simulating our multi-dimensional RDRS models are also developed with the support of numerical comparisons.

TI Performance Analysis of Hyperledger Fabric Platforms
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain is a key technology that has the potential to decentralize the way we store, share, and manage information and data. One of the more recent blockchain platforms that has emerged is Hyperledger Fabric, an open source, permissioned blockchain that was introduced by IBM, first as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, and then more recently, in 2017, IBM released Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. Although there are many blockchain platforms, there is no clear methodology for evaluating and assessing the different blockchain platforms in terms of their various aspects, such as performance, security, and scalability. In addition, the new version of Hyperledger Fabric was never evaluated against any other blockchain platform. In this paper, we will first conduct a performance analysis of the two versions of Hyperledger Fabric, v0.6 and v1.0. 'I he performance evaluation of the two platforms will be assessed in terms of execution time, latency, and throughput, by varying the workload in each platform up to 10,000 transactions. Second, we will analyze the scalability of the two platforms by varying the number of nodes up to 20 nodes in each platform. Overall, the performance analysis results across all evaluation metrics, scalability, throughput, execution time, and latency, demonstrate that Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 consistently outperforms Hyperledger Fabric v0.6. However, Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platform performance did not reach the performance level in current traditional database systems under high workload scenarios.

AB The explosion of the phenomenon of the Internet of Things and the increasing diffusion of smart living technologies in all the layers of our society - from houses to hospitals, from cities to critical infrastructures such as energy grids - clearly demonstrates the viability and the advantages of a fully interconnected vision of a smart world. Technological advances such as the use of open data, big data, blockchain and sensor development in the Internet of Everything are rapidly changing the societal landscape, raising the question of how to guarantee, in a homogeneous way, the preservation of privacy and other human rights in a completely heterogeneous and cross-sectoral world, without impairing the potentialities of the new smart technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data. The 2017 IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management was dedicated to the exploration of technical, legal and societal issues relating to the smart revolution. This chapter provides an introduction to the exciting work presented at the summer school.

AB With the widespread of E-commerce, the need of a trusted system to ensure the delivery of traded items is crucial. Current proof of delivery (PoD) systems lacks transparency, traceability, and credibility. These systems are mostly centralized and rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to complete the delivery between sellers and buyers. TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process. In this paper, we show how we implemented, verified, and tested the proper functionality of our PoD solution. We also provide security analysis and give estimates of the cost consumption in ether gas. We made the full code of the Ethereum smart contracts publicly available at Github.

AB Fog and edge architectures provide a link between centralised clouds and the world of IoT and sensors. The architectures consist of devices of different sizes that coordinate the communication with sensors and cloud services, and that process data from or for the sensors and the cloud locally. In dynamic settings that allow resources to be created, placed, used and removed at any time, advanced orchestration techniques are needed for the activities. Often, these architectures cross organisational boundaries, which causes trust concerns. The origin of data and the identity of sensors or actuators needs to be identified. Additionally, data needs to be stored securely. Orchestration activities across boundaries are subject to a contractual perspective. We present here an architecture pattern that supports trusted orchestration for edge clouds. The W3C Provenance standard is the conceptual foundation of the pattern. Permissioned blockchain technology serves as the platform to implement the provenance framework.

AB Money is a recognised factor in creating sustainable, affluent societies. Yet, the neoclassical orthodoxy that prevails in our economic thinking remains as a contested area, its supporters claiming their results to be objectively true while many economists outside of the neoclassical domain claim the whole system to stand on clay feet. Of late, the increased activity around complementary currencies suggest that the fiat money zeitgeist might be giving away to more variety in monetary system. New technologies, including blockchain and smart ledger technology, are able to support the use of shared and "open" financial accounting, to individuals and institutions alike. The transparency of financial data could lead the public towards greater understanding of the financial systems, thereby empowering them in their financial decision making. Alongside of specialists and decision makers' capabilities, our project most pressingly calls for engaging the public into the process early on. Multidisciplinary competencies and academic collaboration are needed to take relevant action to investigate, imagine, and to foster novel ways for value creation. For this, we are forming the Aalto Observatory on Digital Valuation Systems, and proposing a series of empirical experiments, entailing a search for deeper understandings of functions in monetary systems.

TI A Peer-to-Peer Architecture for Distributed Data Monetization in Fog
   Computing Scenarios
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).

ID PROVENANCE
AB Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant adoption in the past few years and show promise to design applications without any centralized reliance on third parties. In this paper, we present Endolith, an auditing framework for verifying file integrity and tracking file history without third party reliance using a smart contract-based blockchain. Annotated files are continuously monitored and metadata about changes including file hashes are stored tamper-proof on the blockchain. Based on this, Endolith can prove that a file stored a long time ago has not been changed without authorization or, if it did, track when it has changed, by whom. Endolith implementation is based on Ethereum and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Our evaluation on a public blockchain network shows that Endolith is efficient for files that are infrequently modified but often accessed, which are common characteristics of data archives.

TI Mchain: A Blockchain-Based VM Measurements Secure Storage Approach in
   IaaS Cloud With Enhanced Integrity and Controllability
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE VM measurements; secure storage; blockchain; IaaS cloud; integrity
AB Virtual machine (VM) measurements data in IaaS cloud play a crucial role in integrity evaluation and decision making. Hence, the secure storage for these data has attracted more attention recently. This paper proposes a novel approach, named Mchain, to enhance the integrity and controllability of the secure storage. Especially, to enhance the integrity, a two-layer blockchain network is introduced. In the first layer, after the production, the data packages are first verified by leveraging a correspondence between a package and a policy, and a one-to-one relation among a VM, a user, and a node. After that, we propose a consensus achievement algorithm to construct a semi-finished block on a candidate block arranged by data packages. Meanwhile, the semi-finished block is distributed to all nodes, which can provide a certain integrity. In the second-layer, tamper-resistant metadata is generated by performing PoW tasks on the semi-finished block, resulting in strong integrity. Further, to enhance the controllability, a revisable user-defined policy-based encryption method with KP-ABE is proposed. It helps to flexibly control the scope of authorized verifiers. The experimental results on six scenarios with simulated data set show that the proposed approach is appealing in integrity and controllability, and the time overhead of data storage.

TI BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and
   Homomorphic Computation
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE IoT; blockchain; secret sharing; secure multi-party computing
AB Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies are experiencing exponential growth in academia and industry. Generally, IoT is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of IoT. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold IoT service system: BeeKeeper. In the BeeKeeper system, servers can process a user's data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader's server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, BeeKeeper's performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, BeeKeeper is fault tolerant since a user's BeeKeeper protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy BeeKeeper on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of BeeKeeper mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.

AB Due to the centralization of authority in the management of data generated by IoT devices, there is a lack of transparency in how user data is being shared among third party entities. With the popularity of adoption of blockchain technology, which provide decentralized management of assets such as currency as seen in Bitcoin, we propose a decentralized system of data management for IoT devices where all data access permission is enforced using smart contracts and the audit trail of data access is stored in the blockchain. With smart contracts applications, multiple parties can specify rules to govern their interactions which is independently enforced in the blockchain without the need for a centralized system. We provide a framework that store the hash of the data in the blockchain and store the raw data in a secure storage platform using trusted execution environment (TEE). In particular, we consider Intel SGX as a part of TEE that ensure data security and privacy for sensitive part of the application (code and data).

TI SBLWT: A Secure Blockchain Lightweight Wallet Based on Trustzone

AB Due to the increasing total value of the digital currency, the security of encryption wallet is becoming more and more important. The hardware-based wallet is safe, but it is inconvenient because users need to carry an additional physical device, the software-based wallet is convenient, but the safety cannot be guaranteed. All these wallets need to synchronize the blockchain, while most current mobile devices do not have the capability to store all blocks. To solve these problems, mobile devices can use simplified payment verification (SPV). Nevertheless, in existing methods, there is no good way to protect the verification process of the transaction. In this paper, we design a secure blockchain lightweight wallet based on Trustzone to protect SPV. It is more portable compared with the hardware wallet, and safer than the software wallet. Through the isolation, it can also protect the private key and the wallet's address from being stolen by the attackers no matter whether the Rich OS is malicious or not. Meanwhile, it can protect the verification process by verifying transactions in the secure execution environment (SEE), and keep the local block headers unreadable directly from the Rich OS through encryption. We deploy it on the RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B development board. The result of the experiment shows that it has little impact on the system.

This article focuses on blockchain technology as the key to a trusted publishing platform, with blockchains in Mining, Block, Hash, Digital Signature, and Private Key Other aspects of the composition of the publishing platform as the main basic technology. From the author to the publisher and publishers to the authors to discuss the structure and function distribution of the platform, and to explore it, to provide room for the future development of publishing houses.

AB Current digital certification revocation systems are insufficient in the application scenario of multiple certification authorities (CAs), and it leads to a lack of mutual trust, access stability, and timeliness of data synchronization between CAs. We propose a decentralized digital certificate revocation system based on consortium blockchain technology with a secret sharing scheme. It can invalidate the digital certificate in special cases to protect the user's information and property security. Based on the characteristics of the decentralized consensus mechanism, consortium blockchain technology is the core technology of the system. The scheme achieves collaborative management of digital certificate revocation lists (CRLs) by multiple CAs, and introduces secret sharing scheme, further safeguarding the reliability of the maintenance process, and then the online certificate status protocol (OCSP) can be developed based on this system. This system is security, effective, and cannot be tampered. Compared with the traditional revocation scheme, it achieves trusted and reliable CRL system above multiple CAs, which can provide new ideas for the way of digital certificate revocation and expand the application range of blockchain technology.

AB Bitcoin is the most widely known distributed, peer-to-peer payment network without existence of a central authority. In Bitcoin, users do not use real names; instead, pseudonyms are used. Managing and verifying transactions and issuing of bitcoins are performed collectively by peers in the network. Since pseudonyms are used without providing any identity, it is perceived that Bitcoin provides anonymity. However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin-like digital cash systems. We examine the studies in the literature/Web in two major categories: 1) analyses of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin and 2) extensions and alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. We list and describe methods and outcomes for both categories and group studies according to these methods and outcomes. We also present relationships between outcomes of analyses and the improvement methods. We compare performances of the methods and show relationships between the proposals. Moreover, we present guidelines for designing an anonymity/privacy improvement and discuss future research directions.

DE New retail; POS system; Blockchain; Edge computing
AB New Retail has recently become one of the hottest concepts in the world, particularly in China. Many Internet technologies like Cloud Computing have been employed to address the limitations of the traditional retail industry, and significant progress has been made towards this direction. Despite these achievements, an intractable issue faced by the existing cloud-based retail POS systems is that they cannot provide continuous services when the Internet connections are interrupted. Towards this issue, in this paper, we leverage two new technologies, Blockchain and Edge Computing, to design and develop a new robust retail POS system. More specifically, this type of POS systems deployed in a retail store can use blockchain networking, trustworthiness, and security. We take all cash registers as nodes to build a POS blockchain network and store transaction records in the blockchain network to deal with unexpected network interruptions. Once the Internet connection recovers, a node in the blockchain network will be selected as a POS edge computing server to synchronize data with the POS cloud and resume regular communication between them. The advantages of the robust retail POS system over traditional POS systems include less dependency on the Internet in case of sudden interruptions and little or no hands-on intervention required for changes in our POS system caused by external changes.

AB The exponential growth of wireless services with diversity of devices and applications has inspired the research community to come up with novel concepts to improve the efficiency of resource use. It is cost efficient and practical to be able to evaluate and analyze expected value of use cases before actual implementation of the solution. This paper presents blockchain network slice brokering use case value analysis and results in the industrial automation application scenario. The use case value was assessed applying resource configuration framework against blockchain and smart contracts characteristics and capabilities. According to the findings, expected value of blockchain network slice brokering use case was proven and in general feasibility of blockchain technology for novel resource configurations use cases for various network functions was stated. The use case enables industrial automation processes and related manufacturing equipment to autonomously and dynamically acquire the slice needed for most efficient operations. The resource configuration framework provides a dynamic framework for analyzing and developing the blockchain enabled novel use cases and business models.

TI Ownership at stake (once again): housing, digital contents, animals and
   robots
SO JOURNAL OF PROPERTY PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
DE Ownership; Housing; Robots; Tenures; Animals; Digital contents
AB Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the questioning around the current suitability of ownership both for accessing to certain property (housing, to be more specific) and chattels (digital contents, animals and autonomous robots) that have recently flourished, favored by technological advances and the change in the values of the millennials' in a context of crisis.
   Design/methodology/approach - The process of substitution (e.g. through alternative housing tenures, such as intermediate tenures and collaborative housing, licensing digital contents) or erosion/elimination (e.g. owning animals and robots, tokenization through blockchain) of ownership through key types of property and chattels.
   Findings - Ownership, both of land and goods, is again at the stake. Technological advances and/or new values of millennials in a context of crisis have led to questioning the suitability of ownership to favor universal access to housing, of holding music and other digital contents, have limited the faculties of animals' and pets' owners and are favoring the evolution of autonomous robots into subjects of law rather than mere objects.
   Research limitations/implications - Only key property (housing) and chattels are studied (digital contents, animals, robots). There is no broad study of the global current situation of ownership.
   Practical implications - It is discussed how the changes of values and technological advances in a context of crisis have impacted in the strength and reliability of ownership to allow access to property and chattels.
   Social implications - These changes in ownership change how we can access to property (housing) and to chattels (digital media) and even to changes in what is considered "object" such as what is happening in Europe with animals and robots.
   Originality/value - This is a new approach to consequences of the crisis in the field of housing (fractioning of ownership -temporal and shared ownership-, collaborative economy) and a change of values in the new millennial generation (animals) in this context and owing to the advance of the new technologies (robots). Is ownership again at the stake?

AB Designing a secure permissionless distributed ledger (blockchain) that performs on par with centralized payment processors, such as Visa, is a challenging task. Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves long-term security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient crossshard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency "trust-butverify" validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.

AB Patients over 65 years old with chronic pathologies, polymedicated and who receive interdisciplinary care by different medical specialists, are the pronest ones to suffer problems related to medications as prescription errors that can be detected by the community pharmacist as the first healthcare professional with whom they have contact after a treatment modification by the specialist. In this clinical case, we detected a duplicity of urinary antispasmodics in the treatment of a patient who attended the pharmacy concerned about various health problems and who was offered to participate in our pharmacotherapy follow-up program. The incidence was solved. Nevertheless, we believe that the resolution time could be shorter with slight changes in the communication system between the pharmacist and other health professionals, increasing the quality of healthcare and the efficiency of the national health system.

TI Secure Attribute-Based Signature Scheme With Multiple Authorities for
   Blockchain in Electronic Health Records Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Attribute-based signature (ABS); blockchain; electronic health records
   (EHRs); multiple authorities; preserve privacy
AB Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are entirely controlled by hospitals instead of patients, which complicates seeking medical advices from different hospitals. Patients face a critical need to focus on the details of their own healthcare and restore management of their own medical data. The rapid development of blockchain technology promotes population healthcare, including medical records as well as patient-related data. This technology provides patients with comprehensive, immutable records, and access to EHRs free from service providers and treatment websites. In this paper, to guarantee the validity of EHRs encapsulated in blockchain, we present an attribute-based signature scheme with multiple authorities, in which a patient endorses a message according to the attribute while disclosing no information other than the evidence that he has attested to it. Furthermore, there are multiple authorities without a trusted single or central one to generate and distribute public/private keys of the patient, which avoids the escrow problem and conforms to the mode of distributed data storage in the blockchain. By sharing the secret pseudorandom function seeds among authorities, this protocol resists collusion attack out of N from N - 1 corrupted authorities. Under the assumption of the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman, we also formally demonstrate that, in terms of the unforgeability and perfect privacy of the attribute-signer, this attribute-based signature scheme is secure in the random oracle model. The comparison shows the efficiency and properties between the proposed method and methods proposed in other studies.

AB The article is devoted to the definition of the legal nature and limits of the legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies, including the creation of crypto-currencies using them. The interest of the authors of the article is related to the law enforcement requirement and the simultaneous uncertainty of the use of new categories for the Russian state that are of primary importance for its development in the conditions of the development of the digital economy. The aim is to determine the boundaries and objectives of legal regulation of Fintekh and Regtekh; to identify on the basis of scientific analysis the legal essence of these concepts, as well as related categories. The methods used are formal-logical, comparison, analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization. The results are analysis of the current situation on the use and regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation, as well as the approaches to determining their legal nature; identification of risks in the application of financial and regulatory technologies, formulating proposals for their prevention and leveling; identification of stages and main directions of legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation; analysis of foreign experience in the legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies, including in the field of taxation; formulation of proposals for the taxation of certain elements of Fintekh and Regtekh in the Russian Federation. The conclusion is that the state determined the need for legal regulation and identified the main vectors of the movement in the legal field. National legal regulation is at the stage of origin; at present, attempts are made to legalize key concepts in the financial and regulatory technologies market (digital financial asset, digital transaction, digital entry, digital transactions register, mining, crypto currency, token, smart contract, etc.). It is noted that the key objectives of the legal regulation should be the minimization of risks for the financial system of the state and national security, as well as replenishment of the revenue side of the budget through taxation of services rendered on the market of financial services and Regtekh, including taxation of operations with crypto currencies and tokens.

AB This paper shows the potential of Luxembourg Slovenian Business Club's applied research in Collaborative Intelligence for building of large decentralized business communities in Food/Nutrition sector and enabling the creation of consortia at developing new business models. Although Food/Nutrition sector, and related communities are dispersed in many ways: geography, traditions, living standard, ideology, taste preferences, etc., eating is one of the most universal activities. Global challenges are pointing at Mega-trends which are opening opportunities for decentralized collaboration along the whole Food/Nutrition value chain. LSBC is looking to transfer its experience with Collaboration on a micro level (use case of community building of local small food producers) to decentralized communities on a large scale. LSBC is exploring community building fostering mechanisms, based on Blockchain technology, by applying principles of AI networks, such as self-regulation, self-learning, and developing concept such as stimulating connecting activity of agents/nodes. The main goal of this research is to establish principles of effective information exchange that will enable the creation of communication tools for optimizing connectivity of decentralized communities.

AB We experience an ever-larger gap between existing knowledge in the public policy of international trade and security or factors of economic growth and political discourse in the US, Europe, and elsewhere alike. Extremist xenophobia is on the rise. In contrast, we propose an optimistic analysis for the future. It is flows and trends that characterize flows.
   Born in advanced thermodynamics, the constructal theory of design and evolution in nature proposes that 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.' Papers [1-2] demonstrate that constuctal law applies to both inanimate systems with flow (rivers basins, turbulent flow, self-lubrication) and animate systems with flow (lungs, cardio-vascular system, animal locomotion). Constructal law also applies to man made systems ([3-5]). Social, political, or economic systems (financial and monetary system, trade and exchanges of raw materials, industrial products and services), intangible capital flows globally (knowledge, human capital, market capital, and process capital, including cyber-attacks), are all governed by the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. We propose a research agenda to verify how constructal law predicts global policy making. Evolution of monetary system from barter exchanges to rise of virtual currencies, rise of cyber attacks, and latest with bitcoin, all fit constructal law.

AB In traditional cloud storage systems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as an important technology for solving the problem of data privacy and fine-grained access control. However, in all ABE schemes, the private key generator has the ability to decrypt all data stored in the cloud server, which may bring serious problems such as key abuse and privacy data leakage. Meanwhile, the traditional cloud storage model runs in a centralized storage manner, so single point of failure may leads to the collapse of system. With the development of blockchain technology, decentralized storage mode has entered the public view. The decentralized storage approach can solve the problem of single point of failure in traditional cloud storage systems and enjoy a number of advantages over centralized storage, such as low price and high throughput. In this paper, we study the data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems and propose a framework that combines the decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, the Ethereum blockchain, and ABE technology. In this framework, the data owner has the ability to distribute secret key for data users and encrypt shared data by specifying access policy, and the scheme achieves fine-grained access control over data. At the same time, based on smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the keyword search function on the cipher text of the decentralized storage systems is implemented, which solves the problem that the cloud server may not return all of the results searched or return wrong results in the traditional cloud storage systems. Finally, we simulated the scheme in the Linux system and the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show that our scheme is feasible.

AB Information security is the key to the development of modern Internet technology. The distributed mechanism, decentralized mechanism, password mechanism and scripted mechanism of the Blockchain present a completely new perspective for the development of Internet information security technology. The Blockchain technology redefines the storage and dissemination methods of the information in the network. Neither participant needs to know each other, and nor does it require third-party certification bodies to participate. It records, transmits and stores transferring activities of the information value by distributed technology, ensures that data is not tampered and forged based on an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, enables all participants reached a consensus on the status of blockchain data information. And from the current industry research on blockchain technology, it expounds the application of blockchain technology in identity authentication, data protection and network security. The Blockchain technology will be a great driving force in the process of information security technology change, and will have a far-reaching impact on the expansion of information security.

AB Based on the current blockchain technology, a new member point platform was built jointly by the companies from different industries this year. In order to make this platform more efficiently, we should make arrangement for logistics, current funds and supply-chain management system in advance. Therefore, the forecast on the customers of the platform is important for a system. In this paper, we showed the time series dataset abstracted from the member point platform system, gave a comparison of the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the prediction effectiveness on the number of new increased users on this platform, and analyzed both disadvantages and advantages of the two models.

ID HEALTH INDEX; RISK
AB In recent years, the increase of multi-pollutant air pollution index has a direct impact on people's health. Relevant studies have pointed out that the exposure of air pollutants has a strong connection with asthma and other unhealthy diseases such as the lungs. The air pollution has brought health issue, but also caused a huge medical costs each year derived from the disease. Although there are many different approaches to forecasting air pollution, most of them are based on historical data and the environment of local server devices. Some of the data records may differ from those of real-time situations and those limitation of traditional hardware devices. Therefore, this project tries to adopt Azure, a cloud computing platform with advantages of scalability, reliability and agility, to set up a multi-pollutant air quality deterioration warning system. This project is divided into three parts. The first part is the collection of multi-pollutant data and the prediction of multi-pollutant air pollution quality. After the government and private data are collected and integrated into the database, the air quality of multi-pollutant are predicted. The second part is big data analysis of air quality indicators for pollutants indicator AQI, AAQI, and HAQI. AIDE, a real-time deterioration warning system for deteriorating, was popularized in Spark for big data analytics framework and various reports were generated. The third part will be a combination of blockchain and perpetual system performance assessment. The overall system will integrate with the blockchain and conduct a continuous evaluation of the system.

AB This paper proposes energy scheduling mechanism that establishes competitive market among multiple prosumer microgrids. Prosumers based on the their role will be able to acquire production points (PP) for being a seller or consumption points (CP) for buying energy in the market. Contributions of each individual microgrid are recorded by noval contribution metric (CM) concept. Transactive energy is scheduled in such way that prosumers with higher CM will benefit more, thereby encouraging network users to contribute more and consume less energy. Truthful bidding principle of Vickrey auction is applied to prevent overbidding and underbidding to maintain market in fair state. Blockchain was used to enhance trust between prosumers and shift the market to decentralized state. Strategies to integrate Locational Marginal Pricings (LMPs) into the system were proposed in the paper. The system was simulated using 5 microgrids in IEEE37-bus feeder. Results showed effectiveness of CM based mechanism to manage energy scheduling.

ID MODEL
AB Through a proof of concept in SWI-Prolog, this paper demonstrates a business transaction model by which the trading partners can derive their own, personal perspective from shared data. The demonstration is an innovative formalisation of the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology as it allows for switching viewpoints in real-time between one trading-partner's perspective and that of a trading-partner with an opposing view (i.e., customer or supplier), or a trading-partner independent perspective (e.g. trusted third-party). The business transaction model is achieved by uniting REA with the Open-EDI Business Transaction Ontology (OeBTO). The resulting unified formalisation of the REA ontology (REA(2)) also highlights implications for the future development of a) enterprise information systems (EIS) in the cloud, b) social-media-based EIS, c) blockchain EIS, and d) EIS interoperability across business paradigms. The EIS interoperability such as between traditional EIS (which typically uses a trading-partner perspective), and EIS for the collaborative economy (which typically uses a trading-partner independent perspective) is particularly highlighted as it becomes much more transparent than previously.

AB According to the Taiwan Ministry of Education statistics, about one million graduates each year, some of them will go to countries, high schools or tertiary institutions to continue to attend, and some will be ready to enter the workplace employment. During the course of study, the students' all kinds of excellent performance certificates, score transcripts, diplomas, etc., will become an important reference for admitting new schools or new works. As schools make various awards or diplomas, only the names of the schools and the students are input. Due to the lack of effective anti-forge mechanism, events that cause the graduation certificate to be forged often get noticed. In order to solve the problem of counterfeiting certificates, the digital certificate system based on blockchain technology would be proposed. By the unmodifiable property of blockchain, the digital certificate with anti-counterfeit and verifiability could be made. The procedure of issuing the digital certificate in this system is as follows. First, generate the electronic file of a paper certificate accompanying other related data into the database, meanwhile calculate the electronic file for its hash value. Finally, store the hash value into the block in the chain system. The system will create a related QR-code and inquiry string code to affix to the paper certificate. It will provide the demand unit to verify the authenticity of the paper certificate through mobile phone scanning or website inquiries. Through the unmodifiable properties of the blockchain, the system not only enhances the credibility of various paper-based certificates, but also electronically reduces the loss risks of various types of certificates.

AB The decentralized transaction and data management technology that characterizes blockchain can have a significant impact on manufacturing supply chains. This paper aims to investigate the applicability of blockchain technology in the supply chain of composite materials/carbon fibre, in particular the manufacturing of structures and components relying on semi-finished materials such as prepregs (preimpregnated) which require temperature-controlled transportation and storage conditions. In composite materials distributed ledger/blockchain technology can be used for the purpose of tamper proof history of product manufacturing, provenance, transportation, handling and storage.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated services without human intervention for a wide range of applications, including continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM). However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.

AB As soon as the usage of cryptocurrency in the last few years has been gaining popularity all over the world, and this global trend has affected Ukraine, the purpose of the paper is to examine the essence of cryptocurrency, to identify the issues of its legal regulation in Ukraine, as well as using the analysis of world experience in this sphere, to identify ways of the improvement for relevant domestic legislation. The authors have indicated that the cryptocurrency market (or "virtual" money) operates successfully and provides an opportunity to analyse dynamics of the cost, supply, and demand of about 90-100 different cryptocurrency. Problem's setting. The authors of the paper have emphasized that despite increasing popularity of cryptocurrency in Ukraine and throughout the world, there is no single clear definition of this concept. Therefore, the authors of this article state that cryptocurrency is a digital decentralized currency, a unit of which is a coin cryptographically protected against tampering since it is encrypted information that cannot be copied, while all information about transactions is stored in the blockchain system. Methodology. The study primarily uses comparative methods for the purposes of examination of the approaches taken under different jurisdictions towards cryptocurrency. Additionally, analysis of the body of theoretical literature on the matter was conducted. Results of the study allowed drawing several conclusions on the prospects of further development of the legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Ukraine since nowadays the country is neutral in the issue of using and regulating cryptocurrency and consequently it is losing precious time, because: first, potentially loses money, which could enter the state budget from individuals, who receive income from transactions on cryptocurrency markets; and secondly, the state runs a risk of citizens' rights violation because of no real instruments for their protection. Practical implications of these are proposals to adopt certain amendments to the current legislation in this sphere, including setting up control over brokerage of cryptocurrency, licensing of the industry, and legal definition of the cryptocurrency for the purposes of taxation, etc. Value/originality. The paper represents one of the first comprehensive studies of the current state and prospects of development of the legal framework for the cryptocurrency in Ukraine. Its conclusions provide both proposals for the development of legislation in this sphere and may serve as a basis for the future studies of this topic.

AB This article evaluates the legal framework of cryptocurrency in various countries. The new currency instrument is abstract currencies. They are currencies in the sense that they can be exchanged peer-to-peer. They are representations of numbers, i.e. abstract objects. An abstract currency system is a self-enforcing system of property rights over an abstract instrument which gives its owners the freedom to use and the right to exclude others from using the instrument. Cryptocurrency or virtual currency is a cryptographically protected, decentralized digital currency used as a means of exchange. Due to the development of new technologies and innovations, the rate of use of virtual currency is rapidly increasing throughout the globe, replacing not only cash payments and payments by bank transfer, but also electronic cash payments. Among the best-known representatives of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Legal scholars have not yet reached a consensus regarding the nature and legal status of virtual currency. Virtual currency possesses the nature of obligations rights as well as property rights, since it may be both a means of payment and a commodity. Depending on the country, the approach to cryptocurrencies may be different. Today there is already an international cryptocurrency community that does not have a single coordinating center. Only progressive jurisdiction and state regulation of cryptocurrency activity will allow the creation of the conditions that will ensure the implementation of legitimate and safe cryptocurrency relations.

TI Dynamically Adjusting the Mining Capacity in Cryptocurrency with Binary

DE Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Bitcoin; Scalability; Parallel Mining
AB Many cryptocurrencies rely on Blockchain for its operation. Blockchain serves as a public ledger where all the completed transactions can be looked up. To place transactions in the Blockchain, a mining operation must be performed. However, due to a limited mining capacity, the transaction confirmation time is increasing. To mitigate this problem many ideas have been proposed, but they all come with own challenges. We propose a novel parallel mining method that can adjust the mining capacity dynamically depending on the congestion level. It does not require an increase in the block size or a reduction of the block confirmation time. The proposed scheme can increase the number of parallel blockchains when the mining congestion is experienced, which is especially effective under DDoS attack situation. We describe how and when the Blockchain is split or merged, how to solve the imbalanced mining problem, and how to adjust the difficulty levels and rewards. We then show the simulation results comparing the performance of binary blockchain and the traditional single blockchain.

AB This article elucidates the legal and regulatory aspects of bitcoin, with the aim of reducing the legal uncertainty in the operations carried out with the cryptocurrency. This qualitative descriptive research with deductive method investigates, through the study of legislation and relevant doctrines, which regulatory bodies of the Brazilian Financial System (SFN) the operations with BTC should be submitted to. To do so, the functionalities, potentialities and limitations of the blockchain, technology underlying the cryptocurrency, are introduced. Afterwards, relevant aspects of the National Financial System are highlighted. Next, the article seeks the most appropriate legal conceptual classification for Bitcoin. Once those steps are completed, the paper suggests that because of the legal nature of bitcoin as an intangible good, in the current legal apparatus, there are no regulatory forecasts on the BTC, which is why, now, operations with the virtual currency are not subject to any body of the SEN.

DE Patient safety; unique patient identifier; electronic health record;
   blockchain
AB A basic requirement to provide patient-centric care is to have identifiers serve to link all patient data across multiple systems together to provide a coherent service. In most hospitals today, the lack of a unique patient identifier that works across multiple hospital information systems such as HIS, LIS, PACS, and others means that healthcare providers typically rely on a patient's name, date of birth, and other personal information to identify their medical records in the electronic health record systems. However, this information is not guaranteed to be unique to an individual. It also takes considerable amount of time to check on this or more information and requires much human intervention. As a result, providers often have a difficult time properly identifying patients, thus increase the risk of associating medical information with a wrong patient.

AB The blockchain technology witnessed a wide adoption and a swift growth in recent years. This ingenious distributed peer-to-peer design attracted several businesses and solicited several communities beyond the financial market. There are also multiple use cases built around its ecosystem. However, this backbone introduced a lot of speculation and has been criticized by several researchers. Moreover, the lack of legislations perceived a lot of attention. In this paper, we are concerned in analyzing blockchain networks and their development, focusing on their security challenges. We took a holistic approach to cover the involved mechanisms and the limitations of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger networks. We expose also numerous possible attacks and assess some countermeasures to dissuade vulnerabilities on the network. For occasion, we simulated the majority and the re-entrancy attacks. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Blockchain security summarizing its current state. Thoroughly showing threatening flaws, we are not concerned with favoring any particular blockchain network.

AB In this paper, we propose IoTChain, a combination of the OSCAR architecture [1] and the ACE authorization framework [2] to provide an E2E solution for the secure authorized access to IoT resources. IoTChain consists of two components, an authorization blockchain based on the ACE framework and the OSCAR object security model, extended with a group key scheme. The blockchain provides a flexible and trustless way to handle authorization while OSCAR uses the public ledger to set up multicast groups for authorized clients.
   To evaluate the feasibility of our architecture, we have implemented the authorization blockchain on top of a private Ethereum network. We report on several experiments that assess the performance of different architecture components.

AB Internet of Things becomes a major part of our lives, billions of autonomous devices are connected and communicate with each other. This revolutionary paradigm creates a new dimension that removes the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds. The Wireless Sensor Networks are a masterpiece of the success of this technology, using limited capacity sensors and actuators, industrial, medical, agricultural and many other environments can be covered and managed automatically. This autonomous interacting things should authenticate each other, and communicate securely. Otherwise malicious users can cause serious damages on such systems. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent, flexible and energy efficient blockchain-based authentication mechanism called BCTrust, which is designed especially for devices with computational, storage and energy consumption constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we realized a real implementation with C programming language, and Ethereum Blockchain.

AB Blockchain has proven to be a disruptive technology having a tremendous impact on cryptocurrencies management. The blockchain technology potential is one to be applied in other fields. The development of new/small/cheap SoC processors boards will systematically flood our homes, businesses, buildings and cities with Internet connection capable devices. The M2AP is an architecture that proposes a unified and micromanage ecosystem for these devices. Fully interconnected like a network mesh but better prepare to control the data flow due to its device classification based on purpose and data usage. In this paper it is proposed an M2AP architecture that uses blockchain for identity identification, security and trust delivery management applied to a home automation system. A Trust currency is introduced, a modified blockchain structure is utilized, and a proof of Trust is presented.

TI TKSE: Trustworthy Keyword Search Over Encrypted Data With Two-Side

AB As a very attractive computing paradigm, cloud computing makes it possible for resource-constrained users to enjoy cost-effective and flexible resources of diversity. Considering the untrustworthiness of cloud servers and the data privacy of users, it is necessary to encrypt the data before outsourcing it to the cloud. However, the form of encrypted storage also poses a series of problems, such as: How can users search over the outsourced data? How to realize user-side verifiability of search results to resist malicious cloud servers? How to enable server-side verifiability of outsourced data to check malicious data owners? How to achieve payment fairness between the user and the cloud without introducing any third party? Towards addressing these challenging issues, in this paper, we introduce TKSE, a trustworthy keyword search scheme over encrypted data without any third party, trusted or not. In TKSE, the encrypted data index based on digital signature allows a user to search over the outsourced encrypted data and check whether the search result returned by the cloud fulfills the pre-specified search requirements. In particular, for the first time, TKSE realizes server-side verifiability which protects honest cloud servers from being framed by malicious data owners in the data storage phase. Furthermore, blockchain technologies and hash functions are used to enable payment fairness of search fees without introducing any third party even if the user or the cloud is malicious. Our security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that TKSE is secure and efficient and it is suitable for cloud computing.

AB Internet of Things, cognitive systems, and blockchain technology are three fields which have created numerous revolutions in software development. It seems that a combination among these fields may results in emerging a high potential and interesting field. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain. In order to study the applicability of the proposed framework, a recommender system based on the proposed framework is suggested. Since the proposed framework is novel, the suggested recommender system is novel. The suggested recommender system is compared with the existing recommender systems. The results show that the suggested recommender system has several benefits which are not available in the existing recommender systems.

TI Australian Regulation of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology in
   Banking and Finance
SO JOURNAL OF BANKING AND FINANCE LAW AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been heralded as a key disrupter in the fintech space. As often occurs with disruptive technologies, the issue has arisen that the uptake of DLT in the banking and finance industry is likely to outpace the adoption of sufficiently robust legislation. In Australia, the absence of a clear legal framework for the use of DLT not only increases the risk of inefficiencies being realised, but also threatens DLT's disruptive potential. The failure of regulators to understand the nuances of DLT and to implement a targeted legislative regime, aligned with international standards, could have severe consequences, from both a practical and legal perspective.

AB Based on the blockchain, homomorphic ElGamal encryption and ring signature, an electronic voting scheme based on blockchain is proposed for large-scale voting, which has the properties of decentralization, self-management, non-interactive and free-receipt, furthermore the one-time ring signature ensures the anonymity of the vote trading in the blockchain. The public verifiable billboards guarantee the voting fair, and the miner nodes provides ciphertext ballot counting service makes large-scale voting feasible. Finally, we analysis the security of the blockchain voting system and present the performance in large-scale nodes. Copyright (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Public sector and governments have been actively exploring new technologies to enable the smart services transformation and to achieve strategic objectives such as citizens satisfaction and happiness, services efficiency and cost optimization. The Blockchain technology is a good example of an emerging technology that is attracting government attention. Many government entities such as United Kingdom, Estonia, Honduras, Denmark, Australia, Singapore and others have taken steps to unleash the potential of Blockchain technology. Dubai Government is aiming to become paperless by adopting the Blockchain technology for all transactions by 2021. The Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is playing a vital role in many sectors. It's a revolutionary technology transforming the way we think about trust as it enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need to have trusted central authorities. Blockchain technology promises to overcome security challenges in IoT enabled services such as enabling secure data sharing and data integrity. However, it also introduces new security challenges that should be investigated and tackled. In this paper, we review the literature to identify the potential use cases and application of Blockchain to enable government services. We also synthesized literature related to the security of Blockchain implementations to identify the security benefits, challenges and the proposed solutions. The analysis shows that is huge potential for Blockchain technology to be used in to enable smart government services. This paper also highlights future research in the areas of concerns that required further investigation.

AB The U.S. Department of Energy funds a large portfolio of fossil energy R&D projects aimed at transformational improvements in the cost and environmental performance of coal-based power generation while maintaining high reliability standards The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) manages DOE's Crosscutting Research Program, which leverages on-going trends in disruptive technology to achieve breakthroughs in sensors and controls. Examples include: advanced manufacturing of embedded sensors with energy harvesting capability; wireless signal transmission and blockchain infrastructure; and the application of data analytics and machine learning to processing distributed sensor signals to create actionable control interfaces. The fossil energy application space requires the development of sensors capable of monitoring key operational parameters (temperature, pressure, and gas compositions) while operating in harsh environments; analytical sensors capable of on-line, real-time evaluation and measurement to support condition-based monitoring. Controls development centers around self-organizing information networks, algorithms for component lifetime assessment and plant-level economics, and distributed intelligence for process control and decision making All of this must be accomplished while hardening fossil energy assets.
   An overview of DOE's Fossil Energy R&D Program with an emphasis on Sensors and Controls will be presented including discussion of technologies and applications being pursued and their status.

DE PARATUCK2 Tensor Decomposition; LSTM; Predictive Analytics
AB Smart contracts are programs stored and executed on a blockchain. The Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, has been designed to use these programs offering secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine performs smart contracts runs, where the execution of each contract is limited to the amount of gas required to execute the operations described in the code. Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts. In order to show the generality of our method on other use cases, we also report its performance on video on demand recommendation.

AB Bitcoin and its peculiar, decentralized transaction system, have already ignited interest by professional and retail traders in search for profits and by economists and legal experts, looking for possible regulation to contain illegal uses. We instead examine the unexpected and ongoing success of Bitcoin from a sociological perspective, first questioning its unusual legitimation system, backed by the so called 'blockchain technology', instead of by governmental authorities. Then we collect data and elements to reconstruct Bitcoin's history as a cryptocurrency, starting from the mysterious story surrounding its birth. We then follow its spread and development through social networks and words of mouth, together with its sudden booms and bursts, finally to suggest that both users and institutional regulators should be aware of the risks of Bitcoin and of its alleged power to challenge our very notion of money.

ID SLA
AB Cloud users are striving for minimum provider interference in accessing services from cloud's shared pool of resources due to the dynamic and untrusted nature of cloud, and untrusted, vulnerable and greedy nature of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Service level agreements (SLA) are a critical aspect in maintaining security, trust and provisioning Quality of Service (QoS) in Cloud. The SLA consists of Service-level goals or the Functional and Non-Functional levels that are officially agreed by the customer and the providers. The SLA lifecycle is costly and time-consuming process. Using Blockchain technology's use-cases with Cloud can solve the trust and security requirements of cloud users as well as make SLAs transparent and open to cloud users for quick service provisioning. In order to analyze the feasibility of using Blockchain technology with Cloud, this paper, comparatively analyze the Security and trust requirements and Non-Functional requirements of Cloud and Blockchain to solve the security and trust requirements of cloud users in cloud. We also propose a secure and self-adaptive Blockchain based framework for cloud. Blockchain being the backbone of this framework, this framework exploits the feasible use cases of the Blockchain to enhance the trust requirement of the third party (Cloud Service provider) in Cloud and maintain trust and security in the Cloud by making data secure and SLA transparent and open to all Cloud users, aiding users to analyze and make spontaneous decisions for using Cloud services.

AB Authoring, developing, monitoring, and analyzing business processes has required both domain and IT expertise since Business Process Management tools and practices have focused on enterprise applications and not end users. There are trends, however, that can greatly lower the bar for users to author and analyze their own processes. One emerging trend is the attention on blockchains as a shared ledger for parties collaborating on a process. Transaction logs recorded in a standard schema and stored in the open significantly reduces the effort to monitor and apply advanced process analytics. A second trend is the rapid maturity of machine learning algorithms, in particular deep learning models, and their increasing use in enterprise applications. These cognitive technologies can be used to generate views and processes customized for an end user so they can modify them and incorporate best practices learned from other users' processes.

AB The article substantiates the role of the digital transformation of higher education in Ukraine in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. There was proven the need to develop the strategy of the university education digital transformation, as well as the formation of new information and communication competencies. According to the authors, the strategy of digital transformation of the university education system has to include the modernization of corporate IT architecture management, which should be implemented as a cloud-based platform. The authors analysed the main possible directions of the educational services transformation and the accompanying business processes. The use of blockchain technology for the educational content management module construction is proposed. The integration of the educational content management modules of different Ukrainian universities should become the basis for creating a global cloud-based platform for higher education.

AB Although the best-known use of blockchain technology (BCT) is in the field of economics and cryptocurrencies in general, its usefulness is extending to other fields, including the biomedical field. The purpose of this article is to clarify the role that BCT can play in the field of medicine. We have performed a narrative review of the literature on BCT in general and on medicine in particular. The great advantage of BCT in the health arena is that it allows development of a stable and secure data set with which users can interact through transactions of various types. This environment allows the entry and operation of clinical data without compromising other sensitive data. Another important advantage of BCT is that the entire network is decentralized and is maintained by the users themselves; thus, there is no need to rely on organizations for storage. The Blockchain code is open source and can be used, modified and revised by its users. BCT literature is scarce so far. This article describes the basics of this technology and summarizes the various aspects in which BCT could change the paradigm of current medicine. The great potential of BCT, as well as its many applications in the field of health sciences, encompasses the fields of legal medicine, research, electronic medical records, medical data analysis (big data), teaching and the regulation of payment for medical services. If technological advances continue along these lines, it could bring about a revolution in medicine as we know it.

DE blockchain; ethereum; smart-contracts; e-voting
AB There is no doubt that the revolutionary concept of the blockchain, which is the underlying technology behind the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors, is triggering the start of a new era in the Internet and the online services. While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic. An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees. In this work, we have implemented and tested a sample e-voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language. Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet. After an election is held, eventually, the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes. Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets, and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node. This consensus creates a transparent environment for e-voting. In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain-based e-voting systems, our application and its test results are presented in this paper, too.

AB The convergence which brought with the globalizing world, highly affects the network and the communication sectors. Mostly closed source and centralized systems are used for network and communication. This contradicts with the information security principles and privacy. These centralized systems can not fully meet the concept of transparent, reliable, fast and uninterrupted communication. Distributed, decentralized and also transparent communication is possible with the blockchain technology. In this study, a communication application which is based on blockchain technology is proposed. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is preferred to overcome the limits of the blockchain. A prototype implementation called Cryptouch is proposed. Application features and potential benefits are discussed.

AB According to the attribute characteristics of processing craft, the manufacturing service behavior is divided into service attribute, basic attribute, process attribute, resource attribute. The attribute information model of manufacturing service is established. The manufacturing service behavior information is successfully divided into public and private domain. Additionally, the block chain technology is introduced, and the information model of manufacturing service based on block chain principle is established, which solves the problem of sharing and secreting information of processing behavior,and ensures that data is not tampered with. Based on the key pairing verification relationship, the selective publishing mechanism for manufacturing information is established, achieving the traceability of product data, guarantying the quality of processing quality.

AB The electric vehicle (EV) charging scheme can reduce the power generation costs and improve the smart grid resilience. However, the huge penetrations of EVs can impact the voltage stability and operating costs. In this paper, a novel EV participation charging scheme is proposed for a decentralized blockchain-enabled smart grid system. Our objectives are to minimize the power fiuctuation level in the grid network and the overall charging cost for EV users. We first formulate the power fiuctuation level problem of the smart grid system that take into accounts of EV battery capacities, charging rates, and EV users charging behavior. And then, we propose a novel adaptive blockchain-based electric vehicle participation (AdBEV) scheme that uses the Iceberg order execution algorithm to obtain an improved EV charging and discharging schedule. The simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme that applying genetic algorithm approach in term of lowering the power fiuctuation level and overall charging costs.

DE Blockchain; Log certification; Trustworthiness Multi-party transactions
AB We are witnessing an ongoing global trend towards the automation of almost any transaction through the employment of some Internet-based mean. Furthermore, the large spread of cloud computing and the massive emergence of the software as a service (Saas) paradigm have unveiled many opportunities to combine distinct services, provided by different parties, to establish higher level and more advanced services, that can be offered to end users and enterprises. Business-to-business (B2B) integration and third-party authorization (i.e. using standards like OAuth) are examples of processes requiring more parties to interact with each other to deliver some desired functionality. These kinds of interactions mostly consist of transactions and are usually regulated by some agreement which defines the obligations that involved parties have to comply with. In case one of the parties claims a violation of some clause of such agreement, disputes can occur if the party accused of the infraction refuses to recognize its fault. Moreover, in case of auditing, for convenience reasons a party may deny to have taken part in a given transaction, or may forge historical records related to that transaction. Solutions based on a trusted third party (TTP) have drawbacks: high overhead due to the involvement of an additional party, possible fees to pay for each transaction, and the risks stemming from having to blindly trust another party. If it were possible to only base on transaction logs to sort disputes out, then it would be feasible to get rid of any TTP and related short-comings. In this paper we propose SLAVE, a blockchain-based solution which does not require any TTP. Storing transactions in a public blockchain like Bitcoin's or Ethereum's provides strong guarantees on transactions' integrity, hence they can be actually used as proofs when controversies arise. The solution we propose defines how to embed transaction logs in a public blockchain, so that each involved party can verify the identity of the others while keeping confident the content of transactions.

AB Recently, the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a rapid development and significant advancement of ubiquitous applications seamlessly integrated within our daily life. Owing to the accompanying growth of the importance of privacy, a great deal of attention has focused on the issues of secure management and robust access control of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.

DE Distributed ledger technology (DLT); blockchain; directed acyclic graph
   (DAG); virtualization
AB Recently, with the tremendous development of crypto-currencies, distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g., blockchain) has attracted significant attention. The traditional Internet was originally design to handle the exchange of information. With DLT, we will have the Internet of value. Although, DLT has a great potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems, the existing DLT has a number of drawbacks (e.g., scalability) that prevent it from being used as a generic platform for distributed ledger across the globe. In this paper, we present a novel virtualization approach to address the challenges in the existing DLT systems. Specifically, in the proposed virtualization for DLT (vDLT), the underlying resources (e.g., hardware, compute, storage, network, and so on) are abstracted. By providing a logical view of resources, vDLT can significantly improve the performance, facilitate system evolution, and simplify DLT management and configuration. Several use cases of vDLT are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed vDLT.

DT Editorial Material
DE Contemporary Art; Economics; Politics; Art Market; Financial Crisis;
   Globalization; Capitalism
AB This issue addresses the long financial crisis of 2008 and the nature and diversity of artistic responses to it. This financial crisis is understood as a globalized result of late capitalism that nonetheless is experienced differently at local, regional, and national levels. It is multi-faceted in nature, a phenomenon that has historical roots and precedents that inform contemporary responses. Artists are not restricted to engage with the economy through one specific vehicle of inquiry or one type of medium and message. Therefore, the central question that this issue poses is: what is the artist's role in finance, crisis, and the economy? Should artists: fix the economy; explain it; attempt to alter it; reject it; participate in it; or none of the above? The articles, artists' projects and interviews presented here attend to these questions through a wide-ranging lens including: studies of historical precedents such as the Great Depression of 1929 and currency crises in Latin America in the 1970s; artistic direct interventions within financial systems that reveal and challenge their opaque processes and value systems; alternative currencies highlighting the neo-colonialism of global financial markets; and blockchain-based rethinking of art market ownership models. These multi-faceted projects spanning different time periods and geographies offer crucial and distinct theoretical positions. This issue, which saw its origins in a panel for the 2017 College Art Association Conference in New York City, adds to scholarship on these pressing topics and seeks to foster a continued discourse on the intersections of art and financial crisis.

TI BAVP: Blockchain-Based Access Verification Protocol in LEO Constellation
   Using IBE Keys
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTHENTICATION SCHEME
AB LEO constellation has received intensive research attention in the field of satellite communication. The existing centralized authentication protocols traditionally used for MEO/GEO satellite networks cannot accommodate LEO satellites with frequent user connection switching. This paper proposes a fast and efficient access verification protocol named BAVP by combining identity-based encryption and blockchain technology. Two different key management schemes with IBE and blockchain, respectively, are investigated, which further enhance the authentication reliability and efficiency in LEO constellation. Experiments on OPNET simulation platform evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness, reliability, and fast-switching efficiency of the proposed protocol. For LEO networks, BAVP surpasses the well-known existing solutions with significant advantages in both performance and scalability which are supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results.

TI Unlinkable Coin Mixing Scheme for Transaction Privacy Enhancement of
   Bitcoin
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Anonymity; Bitcoin; coin mixing; ECDSA; ring signature
AB Bitcoin combines a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic algorithm to implement a distributed digital currency system, which keeps all transaction history on a public blockchain. Since all transactions recorded on the blockchain are public to everyone, Bitcoin users face a threat of leaking financial privacy. Many analysis and deanonymization approaches have been proposed to link transaction records to real identities. To eliminate this threat, we present an unlinkable coin mixing scheme that allows users to mix their bitcoins without trusting a third party. This mixing scheme employs a primitive known as ring signature with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) to conceal the transfer of coins between addresses. The mixing server is only able to check whether the output addresses belong to its customers, but it cannot tell which address owned by which customer. Customers do not have to rely on the reputation of a third party to ensure his money will be returned, and his privacy will not be leaked. This scheme needs no modifications on current Bitcoin system and is convenient to deploy by any communities. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and tested it under the Bitcoin core's regtest mode. Security and privacy of our mixing scheme are ensured through the standard ring signature and ECDSA unforgeability.

AB The main ideas of our scheme are that the storage nodes are selected according to the updating frequency of data for reducing the transmission and the delay, and the relay nodes can be acted as the owners of data instead of the real owner of data for protecting the user's privacy. Furthermore, by using the DIFF method, the user can effectively modify the stored data with the lower transmission cost and delay.

AB In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), reputation systems and price-based systems have been proposed. These systems require management systems for trust and reward. Due to the characteristics of MANET, the management systems are required to securely manage reputation and reward in a distributed manner. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Management system for Trust and Reward in MANET, called DMTR. DMTR can effectively detect uncooperative nodes which drop packets illegally. DMTR is utilising a blockchain which is a technique to manage virtual credit in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. DMTR sets "mining nodes" which play a role of managing the blockchain and introduces cooperative mining to accelerate settlement speed while keeping security. We confirm the efficiency of DMTR in network performances by simulation.

TI A Low Storage Room Requirement Framework for Distributed Ledger in

AB Traditional centralized commerce on the Internet relies on trusted third parties to process electronic payments. It suffers from the weakness of the trust-based model. A pure decentralized mechanism called blockchain tackles the above problem and has become a hot research area. However, since each node in a blockchain system needs to store all transactions of the other nodes, as time continues, the storage room required to store the entire blockchain will be huge. Therefore, the current storage mechanism needs to be revised to cater to the rapidly increasing need for storage. Network coded (NC) distributed storage (DS) can significantly reduce the required storage room. This paper proposes a NC-DS framework to store the blockchain and proposes corresponding solutions to apply the NC-DS to the blockchain systems. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvement in saving storage room.

AB Blockchain technology is widely known because it is the underlying technology used by the bitcoin. It became more popular because it also can be used as backbone for various applications in finance, media, security and others. One of the main concerns for this technology is how secure the information that the users distributed over the network. This paper studies and highlights the important security issues concerned and discusses the solutions that proposed by the researchers and theoretical solution proposed to address some of the issues. However, this approach needs to be investigated further if it is to be implemented later in the near future. This paper can give direction for future researchers who are interested of this area.

ID SECURITY
AB Threats to a society and its social infrastructure are inevitable and endanger human life and welfare. Resilience is a core concept to cope with such threats in strengthening risk management. A resilient system adapts to an incident in a timely manner before it would result in a failure. This paper discusses the secondary use of personal data as a key element in such conditions and the relevant process mining in order to reduce IT risk on safety. It realizes completeness for such a proof on data breach in an acceptable manner to mitigate the usability problem of soundness for resilience. Acceptable soundness is still required and realized in our scheme for a fundamental privacy-enhancing trust infrastructure. Our proposal achieves an IT baseline protection and properly treats personal data on security as Ground Truth for deriving acceptable statements on data breach. An important role plays reliable broadcast by means of the block chain. This approaches a personal IT risk management with privacy-enhancing cryptographic mechanisms and Open Data without trust as belief in a single-point-of-failure. Instead it strengthens communities of trust.

AB Purpose This paper aims to solve a mining work centralization problem using a gamification-based approach.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors have developed a simple blockchain application that incorporates a gamification concept into the mining work. Then, they asked some participants in an experiment to use the application for a week and gathered some insights from the responses on questionnaires.
   Findings The results show that the gamification-based approach distributed mining work among many participants by increasing their motivation to participate mining work.
   Originality/value The gamification-based approach solves a mining work centralization problem and opens a new direction for future blockchain technologies.

TI A Blockchain Based Privacy-Preserving Incentive Mechanism in
   Crowdsensing Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; crowdsensing; incentive mechanism; node cooperation;
   privacy-preserving; signcryption
AB Crowdsensing applications utilize the pervasive smartphone users to collect large-scale sensing data efficiently. The quality of sensing data depends on the participation of highly skilled users. To motivate these skilled users to participate, they should receive enough rewards for compensating their resource consumption. Available incentive mechanisms mainly consider the truthfulness of the mechanism, but mostly ignore the issues of security and privacy caused by a "trustful'' center. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain incentive mechanism in crowdsensing applications, in which a cryptocurrency built on blockchains is used as a secure incentive way. High quality contributors will get their payments that are recorded in transaction blocks. The miners will verify the transaction according to the sensing data assessment criteria published by the server. As the transaction information can disclose users' privacy, a node cooperation verification approach is proposed to achieve k-anonymity privacy protection. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we show the feasibility and security of our incentive mechanism.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly a reality today. Nevertheless, some key challenges still need to be given particular attention so that IoT solutions further support the growing demand for connected devices and the services offered. Due to the potential relevance and sensitivity of services, IoT solutions should address the security and privacy concerns surrounding these devices and the data they collect, generate, and process. Recently, the Blockchain technology has gained much attention in IoT solutions. Its primary usage scenarios are in the financial domain, where Blockchain creates a promising applications world and can be leveraged to solve security and privacy issues. However, this emerging technology has a great potential in the most diverse technological areas and can significantly help achieve the Internet of Things view in different aspects, increasing the capacity of decentralization, facilitating interactions, enabling new transactionmodels, and allowing autonomous coordination of the devices. The paper goal is to provide the concepts about the structure and operation of Blockchain and, mainly, analyze how the use of this technology can be used to provide security and privacy in IoT. Finally, we present the stalker, which is a selfish miner variant that has the objective of preventing a node to publish its blocks on the main chain.

DE Blockchain architecture reliability; hardware-level; reliability

AB Currently, few works focus on the reliability of the blockchain architecture at the circuit level, which makes its security and privacy vulnerable to hardware errors. To mitigate the hazard, through an iterative probabilistic transfer matrix model coded by a binary-decimal mechanism, a reliability-based evaluation method for the importance of circuit units is proposed in this paper. First, the method calculates the output reliabilities in any leads by the iterative probabilistic transfer matrix model and obtains the reliability gradient for the circuit units based on the gradient and barrel theory. Second, it sorts the importance of the circuit units based on their obtained reliability gradients. Third, combining the sensitized path coverage rate and the sequence comparison, the method constructs an importance-based sorting algorithm for the circuit units with the same reliability gradients. Finally, it reinforces the importance circuit units based on the sorting results to improve the security and privacy for the blockchain architecture at the hardware level. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be applied to measure the importance of circuit units at several abstract levels, with high precision and small time-space complexity, and systems can thus achieve a great reliability improvement at a small cost.

AB This article presents a new framework named ANDROSCANREG (Android Permissions Scan Registry) that allows to extract and analyze the requested permissions in an Android application via a decentralized and distributed system. This framework is based on the emerging technology Blockchain whose potential is approved in the matter of transparency, reliability, security and availability without resorting to a central processing unit judged of trust. ANDROSCANREG consists of two Blockchains, the first one (PERMBC) will handle analysis, validation and preparation of the raw results so that they will persist in the second Blockchain of Bitcoin already existing (BTCBC), which will assume the role of a Registry of recovered permissions and will save the permissions history of each version of the applications being scanned via financial transactions, whose wallet source, recipient wallet and transaction value have a precise meaning. An example of a simulation will be presented to describe the different steps, actors, interactions and messages generated by the different entity of ANDROSCANREG.

AB This paper presents a prototype implementation of a USB charging device with Ethereum blockchain support for booking and payments. It outlines the design of the system and selection of hardware and software components for the end-to-end solution. Blockchain technologies are relatively new and promising development for decentralized trusted transactions, including micropayments. There are many possible application domains of blockchain technology envisaged; one of them is smart grid. Several initiatives are prototyping solutions in this domain; however, there is still a vast unexplored area related to technological and business aspects of blockchain in energetics. Our prototype provides an end-to-end solution that is comprised of a blockchain enabled end-device, Web applications with blockchain clients for users and administrators, and corresponding smart contracts for the specific transaction logics. The prototype was implemented as a DIN rail compatible device based on RPi and a user application as Javascript code embedded in HTML page that can be opened in Chrome browser with Metamask plugin installed. The system was successfully implemented and tested and it confirmed the viability of the concept. With modest modifications this approach could be extended to electric vehicle chargers, smart grid supply and demand management or other utility support systems.

AB Blockchain (BC) technologies have a potential to blend with the existing Internet of things (IoT) platforms. BC enabled IoT platforms can be offered as a service (BIoTaaS) to provide scalable and trusted new approaches in e.g. IoT device authentication and management, trading with IoT data or in providing reliable and trusted interfaces between Web and smart contracts. At the same time this can lead to a gradual decentralization of highly centralized traditional cloud platforms - a needed change in IoT that can be anticipated from the fog computation and communication architectures, too. Currently the two viable BC candidates for BIoTaaS are the Ethereum (ETH) and the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Very diverse applications of BIoTaaS are possible, so it is unlikely that one platform approach or architecture will be meeting all these needs. Two differentiators have the key impact on selection of BC technology for particular BIoTaaS: existence of need for instant and independent on-chain payments and where the dominant focus is set - on the IoT devices or on the business-to-business (B2B) applications. If the devices are central and payments are required, then ETH BC is the favorite. In case of B2B HLF might be a preferable option due to security features beyond trust, derived from the permissioned network model. Beside the existence of BC, other requirements have to be met for efficient BIoTaaS. We defined a set of such common requirements, which include Web/HTTP/REST and other acknowledged application programming interfaces (API) for entire IoT and BC service access, on-chain smart contracts, low transaction confirmation delays for instant payments and near real-time operation, and smart oracles for interfacing the off-chain "real-world" objects and systems.

AB To address the problem of detecting malicious codes in malware and extracting the corresponding evidences in mobile devices, we construct a consortium blockchain framework, which is composed of a detecting consortium chain shared by test members and a public chain shared by users. Specifically, in view of different malware families in Android-based system, we perform feature modeling by utilizing statistical analysis method, so as to extract malware family features, including software package feature, permission and application feature, and function call feature. Moreover, for reducing false-positive rate and improving the detecting ability of malware variants, we design a multi-feature detection method of Android-based system for detecting and classifying malware. In addition, we establish a fact-base of distributed Android malicious codes by blockchain technology. The experimental results show that, compared with the previously published algorithms, the new proposed method can achieve higher detection accuracy in limited time with lower false-positive and false-negative rates.

TI RBAC-SC: Role-Based Access Control Using Smart Contract
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain technology; role-based access control; smart contracts
AB The role-based access control (RBAC) framework is a mechanism that describes the access control principle. As a common interaction, an organization provides a service to a user who owns a certain role that was issued by a different organization. Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-to-face communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as "autonomous agents" running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis. A prototype of the smart contract is created and deployed on Ethereum's Testnet blockchain, and the source code is publicly available.

TI Secure Pub-Sub: Blockchain-Based Fair Payment With Reputation for

AB The cyber physical system (CPS) has gained considerable success in large-scale distributed integration environment. In such systems, the sensor devices collect data which would be disseminated via reliable manner to all interested co-operant entities from the physical world. However, highly unreliable environment of CPS, for example, a number of limitations of existing network middle wares, makes secure and reliable data distribution services a challenge issue. In this paper, we propose a new architecture called secure pub-sub (SPS) without middle ware, i.e., blockchain-based fair payment with reputation. In SPS, publishers publish a topic on the blockchain and subscribers specify an interest message by making a deposit to subscribing the topic. Then, if the interest message matches the topic, the publisher transmits the encrypted content of the topic to the blockchain such that the subscribers can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the content, and mark the publisher as its reputation. Finally, the publisher receives the payment from the subscriber. The new proposal provides confidentiality and reliability of data, anonymity of subscribers and payment fairness between the publishers and subscribers. Different from the traditional pub-sub services, no trusted third party is involved in our system due to employing blockchain technique. The security of the proposed SPS is analyzed as well. The implementation of the protocol on Ethereum of smart contract demonstrates the validity of SPS.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to argue for the role of the blockchain, i.e., distributed ledger technology, in building innovative business models, including machine money, autonomous economic agents and decentralised organisations.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things.
   Findings The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology's adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies.
   Originality/value The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models.

DE Standardization; Fintech; Block-Chain; Complete contracts; Smart

AB Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of a cash flow generating standard for individual financial contract level data and the ability to create such a standard.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms; a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms; and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g. market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations.
   Findings The ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standard's software open source; fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy; and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis. Such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis. The ACTUS Financial Research Foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets.
   Practical implications The adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency. It would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms.
   Originality/value This is a new approach to financial analytics that clearly separates the deterministic components of finance, which can be standardized from the stochastic elements that cannot be standardized.

AB Electricity is the commonest commodity for most businesses in our world today. The use of electricity has been a breakthrough for the discovery of new technologies and has become the main driving force behind several innovations. With the introduction of smart grid systems, there have been improvements in how utility companies interact with their customers with regards to electricity use. However, since the readings are done via the Internet, there is the tendency for the data to be compromised when it gets into the hands of the wrong people. Moreover, customers mostly do not know why they pay huge amounts and which appliances use more electricity, since they are not privy to the readings. The sovereign blockchain technology, which provides transparency and provenance, is utilized in this paper to mitigate these above mentioned problems. A smart contract, which executes laid down procedures to provide a trust-based system between participants on the network is also implemented. Our system proves very efficient as the user can monitor how the electricity is used, and it also provides a platform where there is no manipulation from either party.

AB Mixed Pluronic micelles from very hydrophobic and very hydrophilic copolymers were selected to scrutinize the synergistic effect on the self-assembly process as well as the solubilization capacity of ibuprofen. The tendency of mixing behavior between parent copolymers was systematically examined from two perspectives: different block chain lengths at same hydrophilicity (L92 + F108, + F98, + F88, and + F68), as well as various hydrophobicities at the same PPO moiety (L92 + F88, + F87, and + P84). Temperature-dependent micellization in these binary systems was clearly inspected by the combined use of high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (HSDSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Changes in heat capacity and size of aggregates at different temperatures during the whole micellization process were simultaneously observed and examined. While distinction of block chain length between parent copolymers increases, the monodispersity of the binary Pluronic systems decreases. However, parent copolymers with distinct PPO moieties do not affirmatively lead to non-cooperative binding, such as the L92 + P84 system. The addition of ibuprofen promotes micellization as well as stabilizes aggregates in the solution. The partial replacement of the hydrophilic Pluronic by a more hydrophobic Pluronic L92 would increase the total hydrophobicity of mixed Pluronics used in the system to substantially enhance the solubility of ibuprofen. The solubility of ibuprofen in the 0.5 wt % L92 + 0.368 wt % P84 system is as high as 4.29 mg/mL, which is 1.4 times more than that of the 0.868 wt % P84 system and 147 times more than that in pure water at 37 degrees C.

TI Arbitration and New Technologies: Mutual Benefits
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB New technologies such as Big Data, blockchain, machine learning, and text-mining have made it to the legal world, simplifying all phases of the dispute resolution process. Arbitration and these new technologies share a mutually beneficial relationship. On the one hand, new technologies will improve efficiency, cut costs, promote the expansion of arbitration into new segments of the market, and improve outcomes for clients. On the other hand, the proliferation of new technologies will inevitably generate disputes that arbitration is best-suited to resolve. For example, although self-execution limits certain litigation risks concerning the performance of smart contracts, conflicts regarding their definition, interpretation, and general framework are likely to arise. The delocalized nature of the arbitral regime, the flexibility of proceedings, and the straightforward enforcement of awards are key features that make arbitration the optimal dispute resolution mechanism for new technology disputes. New technologies can thus reinforce arbitral proceedings, and arbitration can provide insurance to these emerging practices - these reciprocal benefits should be exploited.

TI An Anti-Quantum Transaction Authentication Approach in Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Lattice; blockchain; transaction authentication; signature
AB Blockchain is a new distributed and decentralized technology, and gradually attracts worldwide attention, but it is vulnerable to quantum attacks that would solve elliptic curve digital logarithm problem, which is mainly used for transaction authentication in blockchain. The key needed for authentication comes from the wallet. To ensure that the size of the wallet is fixed and easy to manage, deterministic wallets are required to be used. But if existing anti-quantum signature schemes, such as lattice-based signature are used directly in blockchain to solve the problem, it would have made the wallet bloat. In this paper, we present a novel anti-quantum transaction authentication scheme in the blockchain. In order to construct lightweight nondeterministic wallets, the key point is that public and private keys are generated from a set of master public and private key(Seed Key). We leverage on Bonsai Trees technology and propose a new authentication method which can extend a lattice space to multiple lattice spaces accompanied by the corresponding key. Every signature of a transaction uses a lattice space so as to ensure the randomness and the security of the master private key. And we give the complete security proof and analysis. This paper provides the theoretical support for the application of blockchain in the post quantum age.

AB At present, the spot exchange will encounter two major problems in the commodity transaction. One is the risk of the transaction. The second is the transaction controllability problem. The problem of transaction accuracy is mainly manifested in the complex links. The information transparency is not high. The stakeholders are relatively independent, thus exacerbating the risk of the transaction. Spot trading market is very large, there are many difficulties in the process of market transactions, and the controllability is not high, which brings security risks to the healthy development of spot trading market. Therefore, in this paper, the block chain technology distributed book functions were combined to improve the rapid interaction of information. Market bi-directional transactions were increased, the authenticity and reliability of the transaction was guaranteed, and the risk of the transaction was reduced. In addition, the decentralization function of block chain technology was exploited, and the ability of market regulators to supervise the market order was improved.

AB Blockchain technology has been known as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, but nowadays it is further considered as a functional technology for improving existing technologies and creating new applications previously never practical. In this paper, we are focused on utilizing blockchain technology to introduce a new ID as a service (IDaaS) for digital identity management. The proposed blockchain-based ID as a service (BIDaaS) is explained with one practical example that shows how the proposed BIDaaS works as an identity and authentication management infrastructure for mobile users of a mobile telecommunication company.

DT Article
AB With the development of the Internet of Things, a complex CPS system has emerged and is becoming a promising information infrastructure. In the CPS system, the loss of control over user data has become a very serious challenge, making it difficult to protect privacy, boost innovation, and guarantee data sovereignty. In this article, we propose HyperNet, a novel decentralized trusted computing and networking paradigm, to meet the challenge of loss of control over data. HyperNet is composed of the intelligent PDC, which is considered as the digital clone of a human individual; the decentralized trusted connection between any entities based on blockchain as well as smart contract; and the UDI platform, enabling secure digital object management and an identifier-driven routing mechanism. HyperNet has the capability of protecting data sovereignty, and has the potential to transform the current communication-based information system to the future data-oriented information society.

AB Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) has dual aims to reduce emission production and stimulate adoption of long term abatement technology. Whilst it has generally achieved its first aim, its issues are hindering the accomplishment of the second. Several solutions have been proposed to improve ETS's efficacy, yet none of them have considered the advancement of Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a novel ETS model customised for Industry 4.0 integration. It incorporates blockchain technology to address ETS's management and fraud issues whilst it utilizes a reputation system in a new approach to improve ETS efficacy. Specific design of how the blockchain technology and reputation system are used to achieve these objectives is showed within this paper. The case study demonstrates the inner working of reputation-based trading system in which reputation signifies participants performance and commitment toward emission reduction effort. Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model. The result shows that the proposed model is a feasible scheme and that the benefits of its implementation will outweigh its drawback.

AB The issues of trust in the area of supply chain management are an immense concern among the stakeholders cooperating in the supply chain. For a sustainable process of transportation, efficient information sharing is considered crucial. The models that serve as a base for the current operations have several drawbacks in terms of data security and trust among stakeholders, who share information as part of their cooperation. Information is shared in a paper-based or semi-digitalized way due to the lack of trust or risk of competitive disadvantages in the current systems. This paper aims to analyze the trust issues in supply chain management and propose new ways of improving trust by considering these issues at the design level.

AB Internet of Every things (IoE) is a network that integrates a variety of heterogeneous nodes, such as connected portable devices, connected cars, smart home appliances, humans, etc. to Internet. The constituents of IoE are heterogeneous, distributed by nature and also autonomous in most of cases, which meet the criteria of what we call Systems of Systems (SoS). These smart objects communicate and collaborate between each other in dynamic environments which are subject to several security attacks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical based blockchain trust management architecture with mobility support in highly distributed IoE based Systems of Systems. This architecture deals efficiently with scalability issues. It allows smart objects to disseminate the trustworthiness of the service providers they interact with them to the blockchain. This later makes the access to this information possible from anywhere and ensures a global view of trustworthiness information. Thanks to the blockchain technology, our architecture outperforms the existing trust management solutions especially in terms of scalability and mobility support.

AB The use of Blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT) promises to provide an avenue of decentralized, fault-resistant management and data immutability. The wide range of research on blockchain, focused on how to improve upon its drawbacks of latency and resource consumption, demonstrates that the blockchain design has flexibility. Almost every aspect of blockchain can be tailored to fit the requirements of a desired application. However, the wide range of options in configuring blockchains presents challenges in the adoption of blockchains to secure IoT. In this paper, we present the opportunities and challenges of implementing blockchains and present a use case of integrating blockchain into an IoT framework for securing sensor data acquisition.

   governance
AB One of the distinguishing features of blockchain-based Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO) is lack of a central authority. Changes to blockchain data is achieved through consensus amongst blockchain network participants, rather than through a central node's authoritative decision. Similarly, governance, i.e., changes to features and underlying source code, is achieved through a decentralized mechanism. As adoption of blockchain has increased, the need to evolve and adopt new features has grown. These changes highlight the mechanism by which the network, rather than a central node, makes decisions. One change in particular, proposed increases to the block size to address scalability limitations, has been particularly demonstrative of the governance mechanisms employed by disparate blockchains. For example, two digital currency projects, Bitcoin and Dash, employ significantly different governance mechanisms: the Dash Decentralized Governance By Blockchain (DGBB) process, and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, to decide what changes to make to their blockchains. Dash governance was able to decide to alter the block size in a matter of hours, while Bitcoin governance took several years to make the same decision. This paper evaluates the governance mechanisms of blockchain projects using the change in block size as an exemplar. Two prominent governance mechanisms are described, compared, and assessed based upon how effective they came to consensus and made the decision to change to support the disparate needs of stakeholders.

DE Blockchain; Smart Contracts; Ethereum; benchmarking
AB A defining feature of the Ethereum blockchain is its ability to execute smart contracts, providing a Turing complete programming model for distributed applications in non-trusted environments. The successful operation of the Ethereum blockchain depends on whether the miners' incentives (in the form of fees) to execute contracts is proportional to the miners' cost (in terms of energy usage, and thus CPU usage). In general, if the received fee is not proportional to the computational cost, miners would prefer some tasks over others, thus potentially adversely affecting the continuing dependable operation of the blockchain. In this paper we design a benchmark to compare smart contract execution time with the award a miner would receive, to determine if incentives align. We present the design of the benchmarking approach and provide initial results for the Python Ethereum client running on a Mac. The results indicate that for functions in Ethereum's most popular contracts the difference of reward per CPU second can be up to a factor of almost 50. In addition, contract creation, which is done once for each new contract, can be up to 6 times more lucrative than the regular execution of contract functions. Potentially, these discrepancies result in misaligned incentives that impact the dependable operation of the blockchain.

AB This paper build the foundations of a simulation tool for blockchain-based applications. It takes advantage of the huge expressiveness and extensibility of PyCATSHOO framework to deal with the important variability of blockchain implementations and properties of interest. A simple stochastic model of generic blockchain-style distributed consensus system and associated performance indicators are proposed (performance in terms of consistency and ability to discard double-spending attacks). Monte Carlo simulations are applied to assess the indicators and determine their sensitivity to the variation of input parameters.

ID SPECIFICATIONS; MODEL
AB The notion of smart contracts in distributed ledger systems have been hailed as a safe way of enforcing contracts between participating parties. However, unlike legal contracts, which talk about ideal behaviour and consequences of not adhering to such behaviour, smart contracts are by their very nature executable code, giving explicit instructions on how to achieve compliance. Executable specification languages, particularly Turing complete ones, are notoriously known for the difficulty of ensuring correctness, and recent incidents which led to huge financial losses due to bugs in smart contracts, have highlighted this issue. In this paper we show how standard techniques from runtime verification can be used in the domain of smart contracts, including a novel stake-based instrumentation technique which ensures that the violating party provides insurance for correct behaviour. The techniques we describe have been partially implemented in a proof-of-concept tool CONTRACTLARVA, which we discuss in this paper.

DE Blockchain; Dependability; Fault-tolerance
AB It is nowadays extremely popular to devise applications of top of the blockchain technology, due to the flourishing of several open-source platforms and the progressive success of this technology outside its traditional cryptocurrency domain. Testing these applications is particularly challenging and traditionally limited to the performance and functionality verification. However, the progressive adoption of such a technology in critical domains is calling for dependability guarantees. This paper highlights the challenges related to the dependability assessment of these applications, and sketches a possible research direction.

AB Bitcoin is one of the most successful cryptocurrencies. Many people invest money on creating new Bitcoins because of Bitcoin's market increase. They actually buy hardware and power to participate in Bitcoin mining. The market value of Bitcoin has also absorbed cybercriminals. They steal the process cycles from victims' machines and use them in mining activities by malware programs. There have been several security reports about these types of malicious activities. Although there are methods to detect botnets, to the best of our knowledge, none of non-commercial and published papers present detection method for these types. In this paper, we present Botcointrap, a novel approach to identify Bitcoin miner botnets (called Botcoin) based on dynamic analysis of executable binary files. This method benefits from a parameter value that all Botcoins must use across their computations and detect them in the lowest level of execution; therefore, our method can be used to overcome weaknesses of many other approaches. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach efficiently identifies all simulated Botcoins.

DE Blockchain; latent transaction; late-payment; off-chain transaction;
   services
AB Blockchain is one of the most important technological trends today since it has a wide spectrum of use cases (financial industry applications, supply-chain tracking, MedTech EHR management, energy grid etc.) and it offers a wide range of implementations. However, the main goal of the Blockchain remains the transfer of value-bearing assets between an owner of a resource and a client. Due to CPU intensive consensus algorithms, transaction prioritization based on potential earnings, the validation process and so on, Blockchain implementations are not able to support real-time services and, also, to enable a varied cloud computing service catalog on top of the existing infrastructure. Our solution is addressing this drawback by developing a system supporting late payments through our innovative concept called latent-transactions. We also provide the instruments through which we make viable off-chain agreements, between the parties involved in a transaction. Therefore, one can benefit from a service, prior to actual payment. In addition, we offer a service enlargement mechanism by providing a catalog where any member of Blockchain can subscribe and from where one can sell services in a real-time manner with adaptive pricing, based on the context (demand, activity at runtime etc.).

AB The innovative potential of blockchain technology proves to be convenient and useful in different sectors, but these opportunities may also be disruptive and create challenges. This paper investigates technical, risk and security related challenges of blockchain. The use of this technology is viewed in light of financial crime that pose a threat to security on national and international level as well. Firstly, elements of blockchain technology and the reasons they really matter are explained. Secondly, we focus on national security and how is it affected by the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. Thirdly, we elaborate on the lack of standards and mechanisms in connection with illegal activities, particularly money-laundering and financing terrorism. Finally, we suggest the use of fuzzy methods for security analysis and testing, and compatibility with GDPR for better protection of the recorded data in chain. We conclude that a collaboration of responsible entities in different sectors is needed as well as the investigation of potential ways in which actors can exploit further applications. The convergence of terrorism and cybercrime should be considered, and the necessary preventive actions taken.

AB One of the most well-known and popular crypto money, that is also a digital currency enabled in 2009, is Bitcoin. Over time, many alternatives to Bitcoin have been developed. The blockchain system, which is a very important technology for crypto money transfer, provides many different possibilities besides providing transaction from one point to another without any intermediary. Block chaining is a distributed, shared form of recording that facilitates the recording of assets and transactions in a network. In this study, after explaining the basic concepts behind distributed architecture and blockchain technology behind crypto money, artificial intelligence algorithms were exploited, and based on last three years values of bitcoin forecasting was performed for Bitcoin which has a huge market share in since nine years.

AB Monero, a leading privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, supports a client/server operating mode that allows lightweight clients to avoid storing the entire blockchain, instead relying on a remote node to provide necessary information about the blockchain. However, a weakness of Monero's current blockchain data structure is that lightweight clients cannot authenticate the responses returned from a remote node. In this paper, we show that malicious responses from a remote node can lead to reduced privacy for the client. We discuss several lightweight mitigations that reduce the attack's effectiveness. To fully eliminate this class of attack, we also show how to augment Monero's blockchain data structure with an additional index that clients can use to authenticate responses from remote nodes. Our proposed solution could be implemented as a hard fork, or alternatively through a "Refereed Delegation" approach without needing any fork. We developed a prototype implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal.

ID SECURITY; INTERNET
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) network of connected devices currently contains more than 11 billion devices and is estimated to double in size within the next four years. The prevalence of these devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources.
   In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes (referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.

AB Many of today's crypto currencies use blockchains as decentralized ledgers and secure them with proof of work. In case of a fork of the chain, Bitcoin's rule for achieving consensus is selecting the longest chain and discarding the other chain as stale. It has been demonstrated that this consensus rule has a weakness against selfish mining in which the selfish miner exploits the variance in block generation by partially withholding blocks. In Ethereum, however, under certain conditions stale blocks don't have to be discarded but can be referenced from the main chain as uncle blocks yielding a partial reward. This concept limits the impact of network delays on the expected revenue for miners. But the concept also reduces the risk for a selfish miner to gain no rewards from withholding a freshly minted block.
   This paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of uncle blocks both to the profitability of selfish mining and the blockchain's security in Ethereum (ETH). A brief outlook about a recent Ethereum Classic (ETC) improvement proposal that weighs uncle blocks during the selection of the main chain will be given.

AB In this paper, we examine the recent trend towards in-browser mining of cryptocurrencies; in particular, the mining of Monero through Coinhive and similar code-bases. In this model, a user visiting a website will download a JavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser, mines a cryptocurrency-typically without her consent or knowledge-and pays out the seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as an alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium content in exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a result of a breach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its unfriendliness to large-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based efforts out of the market, as well as for its purported privacy features. In this paper, we survey this landscape, conduct some measurements to establish its prevalence and profitability, outline an ethical framework for considering whether it should be classified as an attack or business opportunity, and make suggestions for the detection, mitigation and/or prevention of browser-based mining for non-consenting users.

AB Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are receiving much attention. As discussion focuses on the potential applications of DLTs, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offerings are emerging to provide the underlying supporting infrastructure. BaaS entails a service provider supplying and managing aspects of a DLT infrastructure to facilitate and bring efficiencies regarding the development, experimentation, deployment, and the ongoing management of DLT applications. However, much of the interest in DLTs stems from their potential to decentralise, disintermediate, and enable 'trustless' interactions. At first sight, BaaS - being offered by a provider appears to run counter to this. In practice, whether BaaS raises substantive trust concerns depends on the nature of the offering, the application's specifics, and the participants' goals and risk appetite. This paper elaborates the nature of BaaS and explores the trust considerations it raises, particularly regarding the role of providers as part of a wider infrastructure.

AB Cryptocurrencies have popularized public ledgers, known colloquially as "blockchains". While the Bitcoin blockchain is relatively simple to reason about as, effectively, a hash chain, more complex public ledgers are largely designed without any formalization of desired cryptographic properties such as authentication or integrity. These designs are then implemented without assurances against real-world bugs leading to little assurance with regards to practical, real-world security.
   Ledger Design Language (LDL) is a modeling language for describing public ledgers. The LDL compiler produces two outputs. The first output is a an applied-pi calculus symbolic model representing the public ledger as a protocol. Using ProVerif, the protocol can be played against an active attacker, whereupon we can query for block integrity, authenticity and other properties. The second output is a formally verified read/write API for interacting with the public ledger in the real world, written in the F-star programming language. F-star features such as dependent types allow us to validate a block on the public ledger, for example, by type-checking it so that its signing public key be a point on a curve. Using LDL's outputs, public ledger designers obtain automated assurances on the theoretical coherence and the real-world security of their designs with a single framework based on a single modeling language.

AB The distributed ledger technology presents a very innovative and secure way of managing transactions online. Hailed as one of the greatest inventions after the Internet, blockchain is set to pioneer changes in the way businesses are conducted today through its promise of secure, tamper-proof, peer-to-peer decentralized networks with distributed consensus. These fundamental features built into the very fabric bring in a host of additional dimensions and present greater challenges in their testing. Not only are the technological changes significant, but also significant are changes from a business standpoint. A new wave of blockchain oriented software development is emerging at. an unprecedented rate. This places an additional responsibility on the Quality Assurance teams to deliver first-time quality while minimizing the impact of testing on the teams delivery. This paper highlights the challenges currently faced in testing such applications. It also acknowledges the need to devise specialized tools and techniques for blockchain oriented software testing in order to ensure high standards of quality.

AB The more traditional approach to supply chain has always been a web site that has been hosted on a server the company has to set up or get hosted from a provider. The supply chain data is centralized here, leaving the website the only gateway to the data, thus reducing the availability of data, increasing the risk factor, leading to an inflexible system where every update had to route to the hosted system. The orders, updates, changes, tracking details, and the details of customers, sellers, manufacturers of raw material, assemblers, and others have to be decentralized, that's the purpose of introducing traditional supply chain to the block chain. The decentralization of this data across different levels ranging from raw material manufacturer to the retailer will lead to a more flexible and transparent system. These traits would in turn result into a system where data flows faster than traditional centralized approach to supply chain management. Use of IOT ensures that there are no inconsistencies in the processes that are in transit, automating the updating process that would other require human intervention.

AB Cloud collaboration is a billion-dollar industry, for sharing, storing, and co-authoring files. In the current age of information technology, cloud collaboration expects to see a significant amount of growth, as more organizations look to leverage the benefits of the industry specifically in the areas of flexibility, cost-efficiency, and security [I]. However, existing systems basically operates in a centralized cluster to achieve high performance, though they have a demand solving indisputable benefits, there arc several inherent weaknesses such as high server costs for service providers, illegal data mining in trust based architecture, security loopholes, and unethical government surveillance. Therefore, a large-scale resource sharing decentralized system can mitigate these traditional server expenses, data failure, and outage, as well as the enhanced security, and privacy of data. This dissertation presents a background to the problem, its impact on adaption, existing research background, and proposing design for storing, sharing, and coauthor files. The Design presents a decentralized resource (storage and network) sharing system, with real-time collaborative editing, peer (node) management, and redundancy schemes to manage fault tolerance of the distributed storage.

   Detection
AB In general, a botnet is a collection of compromised internet computers, controlled by attackers for malicious purposes. To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security1 and DYN2, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets.
   We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a permissioned Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of a set of pre-identified parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions.
   In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBotCatcher, then discussing its components.

AB Traditionally, a Certification Authority (CA) is required to sign, manage, verify and revoke public key certificates. Multiple CAs together form the CA-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The use of a PKI forces one to place trust in the CAs, which have proven to be a single point-of-failure on multiple occasions. Blockchain has emerged as a transformational technology that replaces centralized trusted third parties with a decentralized, publicly verifiable, peer-to-peer data store which maintains data integrity among nodes through various consensus protocols. In this paper, we deploy three blockchain-based alternatives to the CA-based PKI for supporting IoT devices, based on Emercoin Name Value Service (NVS), smart contracts by Ethereum blockchain, and Ethereum Light Sync client. We compare these approaches with CA-based PKI and show that they are much more efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements in addition to providing a more robust and scalable PKI.

AB Modern centralized online marketplaces such as eBay offer an alternative option for consumers to both sell and purchase goods with relative ease. However, drawbacks to these marketplaces include the platform's ability to block merchants at their own whim, the fees paid to the platform when listing a product and when selling a product, and the lack of privacy of users' data. In this paper, we propose an application that remedies all three of these drawbacks through use of the Ethereum blockchain platform. The application was developed using the Truffle development framework. The application's functions were contained within an Ethereum smart contract, which was then migrated to the Ethereum network. The user's input was read through a web interface and sent to the Ethereum network via the web3.js API. Statistics about the application were gathered on the Rinkeby test network. The application was shown to have an average transaction runtime of 3.8 seconds, and an average gas consumption of 4.6 wei. Contract creation times for the application were shown to be less than a second. A cost analysis of the application was then conducted. The gas consumption of the transactions needed to both buy and sell a product was converted into US dollars, and the gas cost of the application was then compared to the cost to use an online auction marketplace such as eBay as well as an in-person auction house such as Sotheby's. The results showed that selling on the application is cheaper than existing online options as well as existing in-person options. These tests showed that our application was successful in addressing the drawbacks of current auction marketplaces.

AB Hardware systems are complex and the complexity of such systems is increasing with the adoption of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and with the advent of cryptocurrency and Internet-of-Things. The increase in complexity makes it harder to address failure, security compromises, and lack of performance in hardware systems. Further, such systems need to be customized and integrated by several parties and stakeholders in order to implement specific end-to-end applications.
   In this paper, we make two contributions towards managing this complexity: (1) we present a vision(1) on how hardware system development and governance should be carried out, and (2) we advocate applying a fresh approach to the problem of hardware development and verification, going from a black-box driven model to a white-box model in order to improve trust, reliability and efficiency in a dynamic, collaborative and accountable manner. We think that it is essential to employ automated validation of technical and business specification as well as to carry out analytics and machine learning on the internal states of hardware devices and systems in order to dynamically determine and/or predict faults, security issues, performance issues and address them in a collaborative manner. We lay out the desiderata, challenges and issues in accomplishing this. We also present a blockchain-based governance platform for hardware systems as part of our solution.

AB Today, most of the services one may think of are based on a collaborative paradigm (e.g., social media services, IoT-based services, etc.). One of the most relevant representative of such class of services are inter-organizational processes, where an organized group of joined activities is carried out by two or more organizations to achieve a common business goal. Inter-organizational processes are therefore vital to achieve business partnerships among different organizations. However, they may also pose serious security and privacy threats to the data each organization exposes. This is mainly due to the weak trust relationships that may hold among the collaborating parties, which result in a potential lack of trust on how data/operations are managed. In this paper, we discuss, how blockchain, one of today hottest technology, can be used in support of secure inter-organizational processes. We further point out which additional security issues the use of blockchain can bring, illustrate the ongoing research projects in the area and discuss future research directions.

AB With the proliferation of computing and information technologies, we have an opportunity to envision a fully participatory democracy in the country through a fully digitized voting platform. However, the growing interconnectivity of systems and people across the globe, and the proliferation of cybersecurity issues pose a significant bottleneck towards achieving such a vision. In this paper, we discuss a vision to modernize our voting processes and discuss the challenges for creating a national e-voting framework that incorporates policies, standards and technological infrastructure that is secure, privacy-preserving, resilient and transparent. Through partnerships among private industry, academia, and State and Federal Government, technology must be the catalyst to develop a national platform for American voters. Along with integrating biometrics to authenticate each registered voter for transparency and accountability, the platform provides depth in the e-voting infrastructure with emerging blockchain technologies. We outline the way voting process runs today with the challenges; states are having from funding to software development concerns. Additionally, we highlight attacks from malware infiltrations from off the shelf products made from factories from countries such as China. This paper illustrates a strategic level of voting challenges and modernizing processes that will enhance the voter's trust in America democracy.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB A blockchain provides a securedparadigm to achieve consensus using a distributed and peer-to-peer network in which no trusted central party is required. As a result, it has the potential to resolve many challenges that are faced with current centralized controllers in globally distributed applications. To date, the blockchain technology has been used for recording transactions and tracking objects in which multiple participants reach a consensus on whether a transaction is valid or not.This paper introduces the novel paradigm of probabilistic blockchains, an extension of the current blockchains that allows building efficient and distributed risk assessment and decision-making applications in which multiple untrusting parties collaborate but may not completely agree on the outcome. The paradigm is particularly useful for risk assessment, where a group of decision-makersneeds to decide or analyze an event based on imperfectinformation. The proposed approach can be used in applications like intrusion detections, stock market predictions, insurance, and recommendation systems. The paper presents and analyzes the application of probabilistic blockchains for intrusion detection systems for computer networks. The results show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed paradigm in making such decisions.

AB The growth of technology has brought upon a slew of devices that have the ability to connect to the internet. This has led to much more opportunistic and easier ways to perform tasks but it also opens the doors for new attacks. Blockchaining is a new technology that was introduced with the creation of Bitcoin in 2008. Blockchaining has mostly been implemented in the field of cryptocurrency but there are many other useful applications of blockchaining. It allows for a decentralized ledger of data that can securely keep a network honest and prevent from possible attacks. Blockchains are based on a consensus algorithm and the proof of stake algorithm bases consensus between nodes based on the stake that the nodes have in the system.

AB Molecular and genetic therapeutics, extended lifespans, and the repair augmentation of the human body remain key cornerstones of current, emerging and future medical science and technology. While internal and external prosthetics have formed the foundation of this goal, the growing utility and ubiquity of genetic engineering and synthetic genomics-already being successful in early preventative therapeutic applications-promise a future in which cells, tissues and organs are likely to be designed to express novel biological structures and preprogrammed functions, the latter encompassing those capable of performing technological operations, including but not limited to direct communications with the exogenous world. Achieving this will require and accelerate the ongoing interdigitation of biology and technology, with these two domains eventually merging. This emergent transdisciplinarian environment will have the potential to render external and implanted technological devices obsolete, as their features are then performed by their synthetic biological and molecular replacements. There is, however, one operational concern for which a solution has yet to have been determined-that is, anomalies in synthetic genomics and genome engineering somatic expression. Here, I propose a blockchain-based solution that-rather than being limited to providing genomic privacy, security and anonymous data analysis, as is currently the case-would provide a method for reversing phenotypical expression errors should they occur. By so doing, ReGene addresses both actual and perceived risk, thereby ameliorating personal, medical, legislative and other areas of resistance to commercial applications of advanced genetic engineering and synthetic genomics.

DE Cyber-insurance; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Sealed-bid auction
AB Organizations are interested in transferring their cyber-risks to insurers aiming to mitigate the cost of cyber-threats. However, cyber-insurance has not been widely accepted due to several obstacles. First, the lack of reliable data to measure the cyber-risks makes it hard to calculate the insurance premium. Second, there are legal and procedural hurdles for assessing the organizations security posture deterring insurer for auditing. On the other hand, the blockchain technology has been extensively popularized due to its ability to provide transparency and security. Blockchain applies the distributed ledger to store transaction histories, and the information is stored across a network of computers instead of on a single server. In order to improve the application of the cyber-insurance, in this research, we propose a new framework to insure a cyber-product using the blockchain technology. First, a vendor initiates a request for insuring a cyber-product, then the interested insurers participate in a sealed-bid auction by bidding their preferred premium for the insurance service. The auction winners will be selected as the insurers, and they receive tokens in return of their obligations. In the case of an indemnity request, the auditor checks the validity of a request, then calls the claim function to retrieve the corresponding amount from the funds collected from the insurers. Furthermore, we propose a new method to implement a sealed-bid auction for the insurance crowdfunding in smart contract.

AB Protecting the integrity of medical records is critical to patients, medical professionals, governments, insurance companies, and hospital systems. Integrity of medical records is protecting medical data against accidental or fraudulent changes. Owing to the onset of electronic medical records in physician offices and health-care facilities, increasingly mandated or incentivized by federal Acts in the USA, ensuring integrity of records in an electronic environment has become far more important than in the days of paper-based records. In this research, we propose an innovative Merkle tree-based approach to protecting the integrity of medical records and describe its implementation. The software architecture closely mimics Blockchain technology and is designed to be deployed in a private network setting. The salient features of our approach include simplification of the Blockchain technology by avoiding the use of mining, and as a replacement of traditional audit-trails by its cryptographically secure counterpart. This paper discusses in detail the design and implementation of the application and a prototype testing on a subset of MIMIC-III database, which comprises de-identified medical records of 40,000 critical-care patients. Experimental results show that Merkle-tree based approach to storing medical records is very robust, protects against various kinds of changes (intentional or accidental) and has little overhead when compared with other approaches to ensuring integrity.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has been experiencing exponential growth in recent years, but still faces many serious challenges. The distributed ledger technology (DLT), e.g., Blockchain, not only appears to be promising to address these technical challenges, but also brings tremendous opportunities for new application and business models. However, the convergence of IoT and DLT is yet a goal far beyond our reach today. Among many problems that have not been sufficiently understood, a fundamental one is how to design appropriate consensus mechanisms for DLT applied to IoT, which is the theme of this paper. We first discuss the potential benefits of applying DLT to IoT, and identify major challenges posed to DLT by IoT. Then we make a survey of existing DLT consensus mechanisms, to summarize major principles and discuss their pros and cons when applied in IoT.

AB This paper tackles the shortcomings of the traditional centralized stock exchange systems, such as high transaction fees, centralized governance susceptible to attacks and lack of openness regarding the market actions and algorithms, by proposing an innovative architecture using blockchain to develop a decentralized stock exchange and an open continuous market. The proposed blockchain based solution solves the drawbacks of the centralized stock exchange architecture by ensuring the integrity and security of the owner's assets and orders, self-enforcing smart agreements between parties as well as achieving democratic and reliable decisions regarding the execution and settlement of the orders through consensus algorithms. The proposed architecture uses smart contracts to enforce the validation of the owner's rights and the correct execution and settlement of the orders, thus eliminating the need of a central authority that ensures the correctness of the stock exchange process. The solution was validated by implementing a prototype in Ethereum for a subset of rules for the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The experimental results show that the decentralized solution can offer lower transaction fees by replacing the commissions owed to brokers and central authorities with mining fees that are used to compensate the miners for their honest work in keeping the integrity of the system.

AB Health information exchanges have been popular for some time with their advantages known and widely researched. In spite of their utility in increasing provider efficiency and decreasing administrative costs, one challenge that has persisted is the data owners inability to control data after transmission. The lack of technical mechanisms to effectively control patients' health data in the network significantly affects participation of health and medical institutions while perpetrating the silo-based data management that locks value and potential inherent in the data. This not only affects researchers due to the lack of data for research and analysis but the quality of life of patients.
   We present a blockchain-supported architectural framework for secure control of personal data in a health information exchange by pairing user-generated acceptable use policies with smart contracts. We highlight the merits of our system, its user-centric focus and also show experimental results along with directions for extending our work. The framework introduces minimal risk to data by architecting a mechanism for controlling data after sharing. In adopting our framework, health service providers can deliver a stronger assurance for data management than is possible with current systems.

ID RECOGNITION
AB With the advent of rapid development of wearable technology and mobile computing, huge amount of personal health-related data is being generated and accumulated on continuous basis at every moment. These personal datasets contain valuable information and they belong to and asset of the individual users, hence should be owned and controlled by themselves. Currently most of such datasets are stored and controlled by different service providers and this centralised data storage brings challenges of data security and hinders the data sharing. These personal health data are valuable resources for healthcare research and commercial projects. In this research work, we propose a conceptual design for sharing personal continuous-dynamic health data using blockchain technology supplemented by cloud storage to share the health-related information in a secure and transparent manner. Besides, we also introduce a data quality inspection module based on machine learning techniques to have control over data quality. The primary goal of the proposed system is to enable users to own, control and share their personal health data securely, in a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant way to get benefit from their personal datasets. It also provides an efficient way for researchers and commercial data consumers to collect high quality personal health data for research and commercial purposes.

AB The rise in popularity of permissioned blockchain platforms in recent time is significant. Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation [13]. The Fabric comprises of various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers, validators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major concern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and identify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of the system.
   We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size, endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the transaction throughput & latency to provide various guidelines on configuring these parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2) sequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state validation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks.
   In the second phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our observations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography component (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement policy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the effect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state validation & commit phase (2.5x improvement). By combining all three optimizations(1), we improved the overall throughput by 16x (i.e., from 140 tps to 2250 tps).

AB Proof-of-work, as the core technology of public blockchain, requires users to pay a certain amount of work in order to create new blocks by competition. This article innovatively applies it to the train ticket market, and introduces such a mechanism at the interface of the ticketing system to prevent the system from being attacked. Based on the background of China's internet train ticketing system, this paper analyzes the internal and external attacks on the system, designs an algorithm based on proof-of-work, and expands according to the geographical location, credit rating, and system load based on different problems. However, there is a big difference in CPU performance between different computer devices, leading to the difficulty for some users with insufficient computing power to buy tickets. The time difference in accessing the memory has the same algorithm complexity. Therefore, the algorithm that was previously limited to the CPU needs to be adjusted to Memory-bound algorithms. The results show that the application of memory-bound proof-of-work algorithm in the ticket purchasing market can better balance the difficulty of buying tickets and resist external attacks, so as to satisfy most people's ticket requirements and ease the pressure of Spring Festival travel.

AB Blockchain is a technology uniquely suited to support massive number of transactions and smart contracts within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, thanks to the decentralized accounting mechanism. In a blockchain network, the states of the accounts are stored and updated by the validator nodes, interconnected in a peer-to-peer fashion. IoT devices are characterized by relatively low computing capabilities and low power consumption, as well as sporadic and low-bandwidth wireless connectivity. An IoT device connects to one or more validator nodes to observe or modify the state of the accounts. In order to interact with the most recent state of accounts, a device needs to be synchronized with the blockchain copy stored by the validator nodes. In this work, we describe general architectures and synchronization protocols that enable synchronization of the IoT endpoints to the blockchain, with different communication costs and security levels. We model and analytically characterize the traffic generated by the synchronization protocols, and also investigate the power consumption and synchronization tradeoff via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that rigorously models the role of wireless connectivity in blockchain-powered IoT systems.

AB Blockchain, an emerging decentralized security system, has been applied in many applications, such as bitcoin, smart grid, and Internet-of-Things. However, running the mining process may cost too much energy consumption and computing resource usage on handheld devices, which restricts the use of blockchain in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider deploying edge computing service to support the mobile blockchain. We propose an auction-based edge computing resource allocation mechanism for the edge computing service provider. Since there is competition among miners, the allocative externalities are taken into account in the model. In our auction mechanism, we maximize the social welfare while guaranteeing the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our auction mechanism which shows that the proposed mechanism can efficiently solve the social welfare maximization problem for the edge computing service provider.

AB Thanks to the growth of cloud computing and network technology, different organizations might want to share data and resources between each other. However, cross-organizational authentication systems usually need a central control system, which must be fully trusted. Thus, we use blockchain technology to store the access control list of users due to its tamper-proof and decentralized feature. Our system also provides authentication/authorization/accounting functions by using a virtual coin exe_coin to achieve accounting function. The method of one-way hash chain is used to securely adapt to the transparency feature of blockchain. In authentication system, the transparency may lead to the linkability problem. In our scheme, attackers cannot get the linkability between the transactions and the particular user. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first blockchain-based authentication system with the merits of unlinkability and accounting.

AB Blockchain has recently been applied in many applications such as bitcoin, smart grid, and Internet of Things (IoT) as a public ledger of transactions. However, the use of blockchain in mobile environments is still limited because the mining process consumes too much computing and energy resources on mobile devices. Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider (ECSP) can be adopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile devices, i.e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a mechanism for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the ECSP and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the training data to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the ECSP. We show the experimental results to confirm the benefits of using the deep learning for deriving the optimal auction for mobile blockchain with high revenue.

AB In this paper, we look at the use of hash-based, one-time signatures in the context of the Blockchain systems and demonstrate how the replacement of currently utilized schemes into a one-time signature can help deter double-spending. Towards this goal, we make the following contributions. 1) We introduce a notion of double-spending deterrence, a form of malleability that does not require pre-authorization from the signer to create a signature on an arbitrary message using two previously signed messages. It is used as a penalty to deter double-spending and disincentivize forgery. 2) We study features of various one-time signature schemes, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in thwarting double-spending. 3) We explore the design space of applying our methodology to the Blockchain system with a clear example and design options to deter double-spending. The results reported in this paper are promising, and open several new directions.

AB In recent years, Blockchain has been expected to create a secure mechanism for exchanging not only for cryptocurrency but also for other types of assets without the need for a powerful and trusted third-party. This could enable a new era of the Internet usage called the Internet of Value (IoV) in which any types of assets such as intellectual and digital properties, equity and wealth can be digitized and transferred in an automated, secure, and convenient manner. In the IoV, Blockchain is used to guarantee the immutability of transactions meaning that it is impractical to retract once a transaction is confirmed. Therefore, to strengthen the IoV, before making any transactions it is crucial to evaluate trust between participants for reducing the risk of dealing with malicious peers. In this article, we clarify the concept of IoV and propose a trust-based IoV model including a system architecture, components and features. Then, we present a trust platform in the IoV considering two concepts, Experience and Reputation, originated from Social Networks for evaluating trust between two any peers in the IoV. The Experience and Reputation are characterized and calculated using mathematical models with analysis and simulation in the IoV environment. We believe this paper consolidates the understandings about IoV technologies and demonstrates how trust is evaluated and used to strengthen the IoV. It also opens important research directions on both IoV and trust in the future.

DE Caching; blockchain; proof-of-stake; Chinese restaurant game
AB Blockchains enable tamper-proof, ordered logging for transactional data in a decentralized manner over open-access, overlay peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, we propose a decentralized framework of proactive caching in a hierarchical wireless network based on blockchains. We employ the blockchain-based smart contracts to construct an autonomous content caching market. In the market, the cache helpers are able to autonomously adapt their caching strategies according to the market statistics obtained from the blockchain, and the truthfulness of trustless nodes are financially enforced by smart contract terms. Further, we propose an incentive-compatible consensus mechanism based on proof-of-stake to financially encourage the cache helpers to stay active in service. We model the interaction between the cache helpers and the content providers as a Chinese restaurant game. Based on the theoretical analysis regarding the Nash equilibrium of the game, we propose a decentralized strategy-searching algorithm using sequential best response. The simulation results demonstrate both the efficiency and reliability of the proposed equilibrium searching algorithm.

AB As the core issue of blockchain, the mining requires solving a proof-of-work puzzle, which is resource expensive to implement in mobile devices due to high computing power needed. Thus, the development of blockchain in mobile applications is restricted. In this paper, we consider the edge computing as the network enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we study optimal pricing-based edge computing resource management to support mobile blockchain applications where the mining process can be offloaded to an Edge computing Service Provider (ESP). We adopt a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the ESP and the individual utilities of different miners. In Stage I, the ESP sets the price of edge computing services. In Stage II, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. Further, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for both pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP intends to set the maximum possible value as the optimal price for profit maximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing helps the ESP encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve greater profit correspondingly.

AB With the emergence of edge computing in various applications domains, end users are now surrounded by a fast growing volume of data from edge devices belonging to different stakeholders. However, these edge devices cannot cooperate to share big data because of the distrust among them. In this paper, the blockchain is deployed in collaborative edges by exploiting the non-repudiation and non-tampering properties to enable trust. First, we develop a blockchain based big data sharing framework in collaborative edges for adapting to the limited computational and storage resources in edge devices. Then, a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Collaboration (PoC) is proposed for computational resources reduction in our proposed framework, where edge devices offer their credits of PoC to compete for the block generation. Moreover, we put forward a futile transaction filter algorithm for transaction offloading, greatly reducing the storage resources occupied by the blockchain in edges. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal.

AB In this paper, we propose an architecture for Blockchain-based Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) called GAA-FQ (Granular Access Authorisation supporting Flexible Queries) that comprises an access model and an access authorisation scheme. Unlike existing Blockchain schemes, our access model can authorise different levels of granularity of authorisation, whilst maintaining compatibility with the underlying Blockchain data structure. Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms proposed in the GAA-FQ scheme dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence improve the computation performance needed to support more granular and distributed, yet authorised, EMR data queries. We validated the computation performance and transmission efficiency for GAA-FQ using a simulation of GAA-FQ against an access control scheme for EMRs called ESPAC as our baseline that was not designed using a Blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, GAA-FQ is the first Blockchain-oriented access authorisation scheme with granular access control, supporting flexible data queries, that has been proposed for secure EMR information management.

AB The Internet of things (IoT) is predicted to connect millions of devices. Therefore, standardized IoT technologies play a crucial role connecting massive IoT devices with interoperability. Various Standards Development Organizations (SDO) are working towards a horizontal solution that would fit several vertical platforms including oneM2M global IoT service layer standards initiative. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology which is being applied in diverse applications such as crypto currency and smart contract. In this demo, we develop a blockchain-enabled IoT service layer platform based on oneM2M IoT standards and an blockchain hybrid application. We use a blockchain system named Logchain that is suitable for IoT due to its consensus algorithm. The hybrid application and oneM2M optional attribute added to the IoT platform enables the IoT users to either store their data in a conventional database or distributed ledger database.

AB Blocknetwork, which is the network of blockchains, is introduced. It is a distributed, scalable, secure and ad hoc scheme designed for transforming big data to the higher levels in the data-information-knowledge-wisdom hierarchy. A blocknetwork can be perceived also as a NoSQL knowledgebase. The application areas include business knowledgebase management, and open source, measurement and signature intelligence fusion with military and security purposes.

DE RFID; blockchain; distributed system; security; privacy
AB Since radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been used in various scenarios such as supply chain, access control system and credit card, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the authentication between tags and readers to prevent potential attacks. Though effective in certain circumstances, these existing methods usually require a server to maintain a database of identity related information for every tag, which makes the system vulnerable to the SQL injection attack and not suitable for distributed environment. To address these problems, we now propose a novel blockchain-based mutual authentication security protocol. In this new scheme, there is no need for the trusted third parties to provide security and privacy for the system. Authentication is executed as an unmodifiable transaction based on blockchain rather than database, which applies to distributed RFID systems with high security demand and relatively low real-time requirement. Analysis shows that our protocol is logically correct and can prevent multiple attacks.

DE identity-based encryption; key escrow; blockchain; mutual identity
   authentication; safety
AB Identity-based encryption is a key distribution system in which the public key of a user is derived directly from his identity information. Compared with PKI, Identity-based encryption simplifies key management issue, but it still suffers from drawbacks in key escrow and private key delivering. Motivated by this, we propose an improved key distribution solution called BIBE by integrating the technique of blockchain into the identity-based encryption. Specifically, we split the nodes in the chain to complete user authentication and private key protection, respectively. Furthermore, the two sides complete the mutual identity authentication with the identity information key pairs obtained from BIBE. Additionally, to prevent network attack, we employ timestamps, random numbers and hash algorithm in the process of identification. Through the rigorous and mathematical analysis, the proposed scheme demonstrates a far better performance on correctness, safety and efficiency.

ID MODEL
AB The blockchain shared ledger emerged as an alternative to the bureaucratic banking system that may take days to confirm a payment or a transfer between clients. The blockchain concept evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of financial transactions. Blockchains become a way to reach better relationships through contract validation, documents transfer, and personal and business data security. Recently, the blockchain-as-a-service has debuted on Microsoft Data Centers, and now many share an infrastructure that can change and improve their security routines. This paper evaluates the feasibility of a blockchain-as-a-service infrastructure and helps those who plan to deploy or sell blockchains. A modeling methodology based on Dynamical Reliability Block Diagrams (DRBD) is adopted to evaluate two dependability attributes: system's reliability and availability. The proposed infrastructure contains the minimum requirements to deploy the Hyperledger Cello, a platform to create and manage blockchains. The availability results pointed out a system downtime of 121 hours per year and reliability issues that must be addressed when building blockchain-as-a-service infrastructures.

DE Osmotic Computing; Blockchain; federation; microservices
ID CLOUD
AB This paper presents an innovative solution to manage security and trustiness in Osmotic Computing. Osmotic Computing dynamically manages Cloud, Edge and IoT resources across federated environments set up by different and cooperating stakeholders. In this context, the Software Defined Membrane (SDMem) is the main component responsible to orchestrate the osmotic transfer of microelements (MELs) across different environments straightening the security needs of such a complex ecosystem. The basic idea presented in this paper is to leverage Private Blockchain technologies in SDMem implementation over federated systems. Data access activities will be logged in a private distributed Blockchain-based ledger. This will allow to have a certified, non-repudiable record of all the data accessed performed by distributed computing, thus assuring the overall ownership and integrity of data and processes running in MELs. The resulting SDMem solution allow us to isolate data and workflows in distributed environments where heterogeneous resources and devices are exploited.

DE Blockchain; Smart Contract; Music Copyright; Versioning System
AB In this paper, we explore the design and construct a prototype implementation of an Ethereum application, BMCProtector, which is based on Blockchain and Smart Contract technology, to protect music copyright and ensure rights holders income rights. With the blockchain, musicians can easily authorize and manage their music copyright on a public ledger. Without intermediaries being involved during the propagation process, rights holders can receive a greater share of royalty payments from the music industry automatically and instantly. We deal with piracy issues using encryption and watermarking methods. We also introduce a versioning mechanism to update the data in the smart contract for correcting mistakes made by the publisher. BMCProtector provides a solution to protect music copyright more effectively.

ID CHALLENGES; SECURITY; INTERNET; PRIVACY
AB Thanks to its decentralized structure and immutability, blockchain technology has the potential to address relevant security and privacy challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, by hosting and executing smart contracts, blockchain allows secure, flexible, and traceable message communication between IoT devices. The unique characteristics of IoT systems, such as heterogeneity and pervasiveness, however, pose challenges in designing smart contracts for such systems. In this paper, we study these challenges and propose a design approach for smart contracts used in IoT systems. The main goal of our design model is to enhance the development of IoT smart contracts based on the inherent pervasive attributes of IoT systems. In particular, the design model allows the smart contracts to encapsulate functionalities such as contract-level communication between IoT devices, access to data-sources within contracts, and interoperability of heterogeneous IoT smart contracts. The essence of our approach is structuring the design of IoT smart contracts as self-contained software services, inspired by the microservice architecture model. The flexibility, scalability and modularity of this model make it an efficient approach for developing pervasive IoT smart contracts.

AB The mining and metals industry is a critical component of the global economy. However, many operational and commercial practices remain inefficient and antiquated, leading to critical data omissions, security vulnerabilities, and even corruption. Mining supply chain faces several challenges like traceability, transparency, interoperability between supplier platforms and so on. Traditional systems are inefficient and hence this paper explores the use of an emerging digital technology named blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that keeps a record of every transaction securely and reliably without the need of third parties that reduces the exposure of the data to hackers. Blockchain technology improves productivity by replacing the standard contract with smart contracts. This paper outlines several key applications of blockchain for the mining industry.

AB Ethereum smart contract makes developers can deploy decentralized applications to inherit features from blockchain, such as decentralization and openness. Although Ethereum provided a decentralized platform, Ethereum Virtual Machine for smart contracts, it lacks of ability to fetch off-chain data. The general solution is Oracle data carrier. However, Oracle results in rising deployment costs. It requires Ethereum smart contract developers to follow format in programing contract, this constraint decreases the readability of smart contract. This paper proposes an off-chain data fetching architecture which is cost-effective and highly elastic for smart contract. It also compatible with exited contract, which makes Ethereum smart contract owner able to automate the reply process.

DE Blockchain; Smart contract; Systematic mapping
AB Blockchain based smart contracts arc computer programs that encode an agreement between non-trusting participants. Smart contracts are executed on a blockchain system if specified conditions are met, without the need of a trusted third party. Blockchains and smart contracts have received increasing and booming attention in recent years, also in academic circles. We carry out a systematic mapping study of all peer-reviewed technology-oriented research in smart contracts. Our interest is twofold, namely to provide a survey of the scientific literature and to identify academic research trends and uptake. We only focus on peer-reviewed scientific publications, in order to identify how academic researchers have taken up smart contract technologies and established scientific outputs. We obtained all research papers from the main scientific databases, and using the systematic mapping method arrived at 188 relevant papers. We classified these papers into six categories, namely, security, privacy, software engineering, application, performance & scalability and other smart contract related topics. We found that the majority of the papers falls into the applications (about 64%) and software engineering (21%) categories. Compared to our 2017 survey [lb we observe that the number of relevant articles has increased about eightfold and shifted considerably towards applications of smart contracts.

AB Blockchains were originally used to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and now entire software ecosystems are being supported by blockchains. Despite their widespread use, not much is known about how peers in the bitcoin blockchain network use the system. We present visualizations to help in identifying some patterns in the usage of bitcoin blockchain supported technologies. In this paper, we observe the bitcoin transaction continent-wise via a visualization of the locations from where peers in the bitcoin blockchain network were making their transactions, using WebGL technology. We analyzed regional bitcoin blockchain usage patterns by observing their clusters formation over time. We also presented a pattern of how the value of the bitcoin changes over time.

DE Consortium blockchain; multipath data transmission; SDN
AB The user can organize a social network together with other peoples, in the manner of the consortium blockchain, so that expected contents can be accessed via collecting pieces of data (sub-flows) from members. This promising mechanism heavily relies on the multipath data transmission to transfer sub-flows to the user over the social network. However, the performance differentiation and link overlapping of transmission paths between the user and members could result in severe traffic congestion and packet scrambling. To solve these problems, we design a novel SDN (Software-Defined Networking)-based framework because the global traffic engineering can perform more flexible flow transferring. Our SDN controller has three modules of topology discovery, sub-flow association and path selection. We quickly capture the social network from the most appropriate consortium blockchain where a set of paths with minimal link overlapping and performance differentiation can be found to transfer correlated sub-flows the user wants. The simulation results show that our solution achieves a higher network throughput compared with traditional methods while guaranteeing a low data retransmission rate.

AB With the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT), Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is a key factor to enable the IoT paradigm. Several Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) including oneM2M are working on specifications that will enable interoperability for the M2M within the IoT ecosystem. However, the transactions within the IoT platform are not trustworthy due to its centralized structure. In the meanwhile, blockchain technologies have emerged as a revolutionary technology with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we present an architectural framework that aims at enabling blockchain in IoT platform. We consider a oneM2M-based IoT platform and an existing blockchain system namely Logchain that uses the blind voting algorithm as a consensus rule to ensure the integrity of the blocks. We discuss the proposed framework by highlighting the key points that are achieved through the architecture. We then present the concluding remarks and our future work.

DE Dynamic Access Control; IoT; Blockchain; Distributed System
AB Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) and block chain technology are growing rapidly. Particularly, there is an attempt to change the centralized access control method of IoT into a distributed method using a block chain. With the access control method currently presented, data communication between physically separated IoT devices is impossible. In addition, a policy corresponding to a number of dynamic IoT scenarios must be generated in advance in order for data exchanges to be performed. In this paper, we propose a dynamic access control scheme to solve the problems of the existing access control method for direct data communication between devices and to cope with the dynamic environment of IoT.

AB We present an energy-efficient, security-enhanced consensus algorithm to compensate for the security weaknesses that may arise when a node that generates a block is vulnerable in a closed blockchain environment. Consensus algorithms, which are usually used in blockchain environments, use a large amount of hash to create a new block, producing significant energy waste. The consensus algorithm that is proposed in this paper reduces energy waste by generating new blocks in a single operation according to the defined rules of all miner nodes that can generate blocks and converging them into blocks with many identical block values, forming a blockchain.

DE Blockchain; Monitoring
AB On 2017, Bitcoin and Ethereum shocked the world with their coins being traded in coin exchange markets at incredibly high prices around the world. The fervor led to more than 1,700 startups launching ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and many more preparing one. Blockchain the fundamental technology behind these cryptocurrencies - is being used by many companies worldwide to solve mathematically meaningful problems. enhance efficiency, save cost and/or generate new revenue. The growing popularity of blockchain has brought about the need for monitoring and analyzing blockchain transactions, nodes, blocks, and smart contracts in order to make sure that the blockchains operate legally, efficiently, and reliably. Various government authorities (police, taxation office, banking and financial) show great interest in monitoring blockchain transactions. In this paper, we present the design of blockchain monitoring and analysis system for collecting and analyzing important aspects of blockchain operations.

DE Blockchain; Scalability
AB The blockchain is the distributed ledger technology, and the unchangeability is the main feature. However, the scalability is hindered to satisfy the characteristic. Nowadays, there are more and more attempts to put many applications on block-chains, but there are problems in actual use, for example, the low number of processing transactions per second (tps). Since solving these problems can increase the performance of the blockchain and reduce the cost, to solve them is one of the most important issues in the blockchain; And it is called the scalability issue. In this paper, we analyze methods that various attempts to solve it into following categories: On-chain, Off-chain, Side-chain, Child-chain and Inter-chain. We will analyze how these methods in each category work, what their pros and cons are, and finally compare which scalability issue has been resolved and their own features.

AB Bitcoin, the most popular peer-to-peer electronic cash system stands strong in its feature of decentralized architecture based on the blockchain technology. The blockchain platform allows the maintenance of a shared distributed ledger, which can be simultaneously read/accumulated by all participants without being owned/controlled by any central unit or person. This paper focuses on scoping the networking side of the Bitcoin blockchain network. In our study, we analyze how Bitcoin utilizes the flooding peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol to broadcast events through the bitcoin network to update the replicas of the ledger. We then use the collected data to identify the process of data propagation, the broadcasting delay, and the bandwidth needed to keep up with the ledger real-time updates.

DE Trust; Reputation; Blockchain; e-Commerce
AB E-commerce has become an essential part of our life allowing us to buy products, request services, and transfer money easily with a press of a button. In general, people consider various factors of a product like price, quality, etc. before making purchases. When it comes to choosing one of the sellers having a same product with similar price, customers pay attention to each seller's reputation or the degree of trust to the seller. On the existing online payment systems, however, information such as reputation could be manipulated by the malicious (including the advertisers) giving extremely high or low ratings on purpose. Furthermore, as each individual has different criteria on ways to evaluate, the result value of reputation could be non-objective resulting in unreliability of data.
   In this paper, we propose Reptor, a model for calculation of trust and reputation with the values stored on blockchain-based payment system's ledger. Reptor is applied on blockchain-based online payment system which has a characteristic of immutability. Reptor normalizes the evaluations given by each user based on personal evaluation criteria changing over time. In addition, Reptor derives reputation of users and trust of one to another by applying psychological factors. Simulation results show that our Reptor is able to derive robust and objective values from immutable transactions on blockchain-based online payment system.

AB As the complexity of software increases, the importance of software quality is ever increasing, as everyone recognizes. In order to secure software quality, various engineering methods have been proposed. However, because these methods are very specialized, the reality is that it is difficult to apply them to a distributed and small scale development environment. So, to solve this problem, a tool to analyze the quality of source code is used. Still, it is not easy to rely on code quality in a distributed development environment. In this study, source code quality data measured in a distributed development environment is stored in a blockchain ledger based on a graph database. In this way, the reliability of code quality in a distributed development environment can be enhanced.

AB In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in the number of cryptocurrencies and the technology that underpins all the cryptocurrencies is the Blockchain. The blockchain serves as a decentralized, cryptographically signed ledger that enables payments in a trustless manner. While there are limitless applications of the blockchain, the problem that persists is the limited scaling of the blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain, are able to process only 7 transactions per second and 15 transactions per second respectively. All the participating mining nodes in the blockchain network perform heavy computation and compete to mine a block, but only one of them succeeds and others waste their computation. In this paper, we propose a new node count based transaction propagation protocol for less competitive mining called as NoCo. NoCo distributes a transaction from a node to the nearby miners based on the node count between them and thereby decreasing the competition, and hence this is beneficial for the miners as well as for the networks scalability. The protocol tries to parallelize the mining in the network. The protocol scales the transaction rates almost linearly.

AB Blockchain is an immutable and shared database of time stamped transactions that supports decentralization and strong consistency support over many authoritative domains where trust is a major factor. The above advantage of Blockchain makes it potentially suitable for a diverse set of applications in many sectors like healthcare, education and finance. In this paper, we propose a globally trusted blockchain based educational framework among various stakeholders like universities, companies and other higher educational institutions that agree to collaborate as a part of the framework. This framework aids to verify academic certificates and course credits of a student registered in a university which can be digitally transferred among the stakeholders. This ensures a global view of a student's performance by achieving consistency among the local copies of educational certificates and credits. The proposed framework will assign tokens on successful completion of courses as credits of registered students in various universities. The transferred credits will act as transactions mined as blocks and added to longest chain. It will work in a homogeneous environment where all stakeholders collaborate irrespective of the hurdles of legal and administrative policies.

AB Blockchain technology has been recently applied in many applications including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Internet of Things, healthcare, and supply chain management. The essential properties are the capabilities in doing verification and maintaining data integrity which would be hardly guaranteed in other systems. As millions of packages are daily sent, information related to those packages must be protected since they are prone to attacks such as phishing. In addition, current package delivery systems are mostly implemented on a centralized platform which would be vulnerable to different kind of attacks. In this paper, we propose a package delivery system based on the blockchain technology which would help enhance the security with data integrity and the verification of both users and data. We evaluate the performance of our system using two operations: insertions and reads/writes under high workload. We found that our system performance for both insertions and reads/writes is highly sensitive to the number of chains rather than the number of transactions per chain. But, the time spent for reads/writes is much higher than the time spent for insertions.

AB Modern communication technologies and cryptographic technologies have pushed social networks into the virtual world, but they have also ensured the real existence of social proximity. In the evaluation of social proximity, some decentralized scenarios require the participants bootstrapping tust, and the existing authentication key exchange scheme can hardly satisfy the above requirements. In this study, we have designed a homomorphic hash and Blockchain based authenticated key exchange protocol with privacy protection, and prove its security under the standard model based on hash one-way, discrete logarithm and Blockchain transaction-level security assumption, and discussed the attack that the proposed scheme can resist. Compared with the existing scheme, the proposed scheme does not need the default Unit of Trust, is safer and more flexible, suitable for the scenarios that require strangers to bootstrap trust.

AB State machine replication, or "consensus", is a central abstraction for distributed systems where a set of nodes seek to agree on an ever-growing, linearly-ordered log. In this paper, we propose a practical new paradigm called Thunderella for achieving state machine replication by combining a fast, asynchronous path with a (slow) synchronous "fall-back" path (which only gets executed if something goes wrong); as a consequence, we get simple state machine replications that essentially are as robust as the best synchronous protocols, yet "optimistically" (if a super majority of the players are honest), the protocol "instantly" confirms transactions.
   We provide instantiations of this paradigm in both permissionless (using proof-of-work) and permissioned settings. Most notably, this yields a new blockchain protocol (for the permissionless setting) that remains resilient assuming only that a majority of the computing power is controlled by honest players, yet optimistically-if 3/4 of the computing power is controlled by honest players, and a special player called the "accelerator", is honest-transactions are confirmed as fast as the actual message delay in the network. We additionally show the 3/4 optimistic bound is tight for protocols that are resilient assuming only an honest majority.

ID SECURITY
AB An exciting recent line of work has focused on formally investigating the core cryptographic assumptions underlying the security of Bitcoin. In a nutshell, these works conclude that Bitcoin is secure if and only if the majority of the mining power is honest. Despite their great impact, however, these works do not address an incisive question asked by positivists and Bitcoin critics, which is fuelled by the fact that Bitcoin indeed works in reality: Why should the real-world system adhere to these assumptions?
   In this work we employ the machinery from the Rational Protocol Design (RPD) framework by Garay et al. [FOCS 2013] to analyze Bitcoin and address questions such as the above. We show that under the natural class of incentives for the miners' behavior-i.e., rewarding them for adding blocks to the blockchain but having them pay for miningwe can reserve the honest majority assumption as a fallback, or even, depending on the application, completely replace it by the assumption that the miners aim to maximize their revenue.
   Our results underscore the appropriateness of RPD as a "rational cryptography" framework for analyzing Bitcoin. Along the way, we devise significant extensions to the original RPD machinery that broaden its applicability to cryptocurrencies, which may be of independent interest.

AB We present "Ouroboros Praos", a proof-of-stake blockchain protocol that, for the first time, provides security against fully-adaptive corruption in the semi-synchronous setting: Specifically, the adversary can corrupt any participant of a dynamically evolving population of stakeholders at any moment as long the stakeholder distribution maintains an honest majority of stake; furthermore, the protocol tolerates an adversarially-controlled message delivery delay unknown to protocol participants.
   To achieve these guarantees we formalize and realize in the universal composition setting a suitable form of forward secure digital signatures and a new type of verifiable random function that maintains unpredictability under malicious key generation. Our security proof develops a general combinatorial framework for the analysis of semi-synchronous blockchains that may be of independent interest. We prove our protocol secure under standard cryptographic assumptions in the random oracle model.

   MAPS; MULTISIGNATURES; HASH
AB In this work we construct efficient aggregate signatures from the RSA assumption in the synchronized setting. In this setting, the signing algorithm takes as input a (time) period t as well the secret key and message. A signer should sign at most once for each t. A set of signatures can be aggregated so long as they were all created for the same period t. Synchronized aggregate signatures are useful in systems where there is a natural reporting period such as log and sensor data, or for signatures embedded in a blockchain protocol.
   We design a synchronized aggregate signature scheme that works for a bounded number of periods T that is given as a parameter to a global system setup. The big technical question is whether we can create solutions that will perform well with the large T values that we might use in practice. For instance, if one wanted signing keys to last up to ten years and be able to issue signatures every second, then we would need to support a period bound of upwards of 2(28).
   We build our solution in stages where we start with an initial solution that establishes feasibility, but has an impractically large signing time where the number of exponentiations and prime searches grows linearly with T. We prove this scheme secure in the standard model under the RSA assumption with respect to honestly-generated keys. We then provide a tradeoff method where one can tradeoff the time to create signatures with the space required to store private keys. One point in the tradeoff is where each scales with root T.
   Finally, we reach our main innovation which is a scheme where both the signing time and storage scale with lg T which allows for us to keep both computation and storage costs modest even for large values of T. Conveniently, our final scheme uses the same verification algorithm, and has the same distribution of public keys and signatures as the first scheme. Thus we are able to recycle the existing security proof for the new scheme.
   We also extend our results to the identity-based setting in the random oracle model, which can further reduce the overall cryptographic overhead. We conclude with a detailed evaluation of the signing time and storage requirements for various settings of the system parameters.

AB At ITCS 2013, Mahmoody, Moran and Vadhan [MMV13] introduce and construct publicly verifiable proofs of sequential work, which is a protocol for proving that one spent sequential computational work related to some statement. The original motivation for such proofs included non-interactive time-stamping and universally verifiable CPU benchmarks. A more recent application, and our main motivation, are blockchain designs, where proofs of sequential work can be used - in combination with proofs of space - as a more ecological and economical substitute for proofs of work which are currently used to secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
   The construction proposed by [MMV13] is based on a hash function and can be proven secure in the random oracle model, or assuming inherently sequential hash-functions, which is a new standard model assumption introduced in their work.
   In a proof of sequential work, a prover gets a "statement"., a time parameter N and access to a hash-function H, which for the security proof is modelled as a random oracle. Correctness requires that an honest prover can make a verifier accept making only N queries to H, while soundness requires that any prover who makes the verifier accept must have made (almost) N sequential queries to H. Thus a solution constitutes a proof that N time passed since. was received. Solutions must be publicly verifiable in time at most polylogarithmic in N.
   The construction of [MMV13] is based on "depth-robust" graphs, and as a consequence has rather poor concrete parameters. But the major drawback is that the prover needs not just N time, but also N space to compute a proof.
   In this work we propose a proof of sequential work which is much simpler, more efficient and achieves much better concrete bounds. Most importantly, the space required can be as small as log(N) (but we get better soundness using slightly more memory than that).
   An open problem stated by [MMV13] that our construction does not solve either is achieving a "unique" proof, where even a cheating prover can only generate a single accepting proof. This property would be extremely useful for applications to blockchains.

AB This paper provides an extension to a family of games that are in the theme of distributed energy systems. This extension of the family of games is a direct result of developing a derived type of game, that is, an energy trading and investing game that involves the infrastructural usage of a new technology, in this particular case, blockchain (a type of distributed ledger technology). The game's novel architecture is explained succinctly, and some results are discussed. Shortly, the extensions of the generic architecture are listed, and special emphasis is put on the idea that such a game must have a two-phased play - one with the novel technology not active and one with it activated. Finally, some insights in game architecture development and the necessary next steps are posited.

AB The volume of data generated is increasing. Companies capture large amounts of bytes of information about customers, vendors, products, sensory components, and especially their manufacturing operations. However, important problems, such as the Supply Chain Management processes, present difficulties regarding the security, integrity and validity of information generated in different databases. Blockchain technology presents itself as a disruptive process control technology where, through Smart Contracts, it provides transaction reliability and assures the parties involved that its purpose is strictly adhered to. Meanwhile, Big Data is offered as a solution to analyze all the information originated from the operations generated. In this article, as a contribution, possibilities of information generation will be presented, with the interaction of Blockchain, Cyber Physical Systems, Internet of Things technologies in function of the Supply Chain Management processes, so that they can later be analyzed through Big Data, giving users better controls and decision management in favor of improving their business.

AB Mixed reality telepresence is becoming an increasingly popular form of interaction in social and collaborative applications. We are interested in how created virtual spaces can be archived, mapped, shared, and reused among different applications. Therefore, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer model of distribution, with virtual spaces represented as blocks. We demonstrate the integration of our system in a collaborative mixed reality application and discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach.

AB The enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption and use phenomenon has attracted much of the attention of production researchers over the last two to three decades. Through a systematic literature review, the purpose of this paper is to conduct a detailed examination of the investigation of ERP adoption and use in production research, more specifically. The paper provides a synthetic view of the various research approaches and designs having been used and presents an overview of the studied: vendors/systems, ERP deployment types, implementation outcomes, benefits, critical success factors, risk factors and effects based on identified 61 articles. Further research directions are proposed including the urgent need for researchers to examine ERP implementation with regards to IoT, big data analytics, machine learning and blockchain. The contribution of this study lies in the provided taxonomy, the detailed description of classifications, the adopted methodology, and the identification of research gaps.

AB The scientific enterprise relies on a peer-review process to maintain the quality of academic discourse and to ensure researchers develop a valid and consistent cumulative body of knowledge. In recent years, it appears that the review capacity in the IS field has decreased, which indicates that the community's hunger for publication accompanies only a modest appetite for providing the necessary support to sustain the consequent increase in peer-review load. The advent of blockchain technologies and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies presents an opportunity to develop a token-based peer-review payment system that can clear the congested review pipelines while also controlling for quality and spreading the equity that peer review generates in a fair fashion through market-regulation mechanisms. Despite the digital transformation of the publishing industry, little has been done thus far to address the chronic inefficiency of the review process. The typical review cycles, which are measured in years, suggest that something needs to change. Developing a token-based peer-review payment system may be an opportunity not only to address the apparent challenge in the peer-review process but also to assert our proclaimed role as stewards of the digital revolution.

AB This paper aims to link the blockchain technology with property issues and in extend architectural design decisions at the urban scale. In an urban design context, this paper investigates the new potentials of urban form connected to the application of the logic of the blockchain to urban design. With this, the article concentrates on the distributed way of sharing information, with no intent to focus on cryptography issues related to the blockchain. Transferring the blockchain's core concepts of data distribution through ledgers, to patterns of shared and private owned spaces it can lead to what we propose as polyphonic spaces, with overlapping uses. Urban realm, designed as a chain, initiates with the binary condition of private and shared but handles it as a way to interact, through nesting, its initial parts. We think that the blockchain theory is capable of challenging architecture by shifting the weight from individual elements of composition to compound entities (block) that incorporate all the information needed.Please write your abstract here by clicking this paragraph.

AB The robustness of modern power systems depends on the level of cyber security against cyber-attacks. Since energy transactions could significantly affect the power system operation, these transactions should be evaluated through a secure system to enhance the power system reliability. In this paper, a blockchain-based energy transaction framework is introduced and the level of security for different energy transaction frameworks are evaluated by calculating the overall probability of successful attacks (PSA) to each one. PSA is defined as a successful attack to the system which can lead to the system collapse. The numerical results will demonstrate that the blockchain based energy transaction framework is the most reliable system against cyber-attacks comparing with traditional centralized and modified decentralized energy transaction frameworks.

TI Searching an Encrypted Cloud Meets Blockchain: A Decentralized, Reliable

AB Enabling search directly over encrypted data is a desirable technique to allow users to effectively utilize encrypted data outsourced to a remote server like cloud service provider. So far, most existing solutions focus on an honest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. It is not until recently that a few works address the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on the specific encrypted search index structures, and fail to support complex queries. There is a lack of a general verification mechanism that can be applied to all search schemes. Moreover, no effective countermeasures (e g., punishing the cheater) are available when an unfaithful server is detected.
   In this work, we explore the potential of smart contract in Ethereum, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology that provides a new paradigm for trusted and transparent computing. By replacing the central server with a carefully designed smart contract, we construct a decentralized privacy preserving search scheme where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance and without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. To better support practical applications, we introduce fairness to our scheme by designing a new smart contract for a financially-fair search construction, in which every participant (especially in the multiuser setting) is treated equally and incentivized to conform to correct computations. In this way, an honest party can always gain what he deserves while a malicious one gets nothing. Finally, we implement a prototype of our construction and deploy it to a locally simulated network and an official Ethereum test network, respectively. The extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the practicability of our decentralized search scheme over encrypted data.

AB Being the largest blockchain with the capability of running smart contracts, Ethereum has attracted wide attention and its market capitalization has reached 20 billion USD. Ethereum not only supports its cryptocurrency named Ether but also provides a decentralized platform to execute smart contracts in the Ethereum virtual machine. Although Ether's price is approaching 200 USD and nearly 600K smart contracts have been deployed to Ethereum, little is known about the characteristics of its users, smart contracts, and the relationships among them. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on Ethereum by leveraging graph analysis to characterize three major activities on Ethereum, namely money transfer, smart contract creation, and smart contract invocation. We design a new approach to collect all transaction data, construct three graphs from the data to characterize major activities, and discover new observations and insights from these graphs. Moreover, we propose new approaches based on cross-graph analysis to address two security issues in Ethereum. The evaluation through real cases demonstrates the effectiveness of our new approaches.

AB In recent years, real-world attacks against PKI take place frequently. For example, malicious domains' certificates issued by compromised CAs are widespread, and revoked certificates are still trusted by clients. In spite of a lot of research to improve the security of SSL/TLS connections, there are still some problems unsolved. On one hand, although log-based schemes provided certificate audit service to quickly detect CAs' misbehavior, the security and data consistency of log servers are ignored. On the other hand, revoked certificates checking is neglected due to the incomplete, insecure and inefficient certificate revocation mechanisms. Further, existing revoked certificates checking schemes are centralized which would bring safety bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based public and efficient audit scheme for TLS connections, which is called Certchain. Specially, we propose a dependability-rank based consensus protocol in our blockchain system and a new data structure to support certificate forward traceability. Furthermore, we present a method that utilizes dual counting bloom filter (DCBF) with eliminating false positives to achieve economic space and efficient query for certificate revocation checking. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that CertChain is suitable in practice with moderate overhead.

AB The Blockchain paradigm provides a popular mechanism for establishing trust and consensus in distributed environments. While Blockchain technology is currently primarily deployed in crypto-currency systems like Bitcoin, the concept is also expected to emerge as a key component of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), enabling novel applications in digital health, smart energy, asset tracking and smart transportation.
   As Blockchain networks evolve to industrial deployments with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes, the block transfer and processing delays arise as a critical issue which may create greater potential for forks and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Motivated by these issues, we develop stochastic network models to capture the Blockchain evolution and dynamics and analyze the impact of the block dissemination delay and hashing power of the member nodes on Blockchain performance in terms of the overall block generation rate and required computational power for launching a successful attack.
   The results provide useful insight in crucial design issues, e.g., how to adjust the `difficulty-of-work' in the presence of delay so as to achieve a target block generation rate or appropriate level of immunity from adversarial attacks. We employ a combination of analytical calculations and simulation experiments to investigate both stationary and transient performance features, and demonstrate close agreement with measurements on a wide-area network testbed running the Ethereum protocol.

AB Mining is the foundation of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin rewarding the miner for finding blocks for new transactions. The Monero currency enables mining with standard hardware in contrast to special hardware (ASICs) as often used in Bitcoin, paving the way for in-browser mining as a new revenue model for website operators. In this work, we study the prevalence of this new phenomenon. We identify and classify mining websites in 138M domains and present a new fingerprinting method which finds up to a factor of 5.7 more miners than publicly available block lists. Our work identifies and dissects Coinhive as the major browser-mining stakeholder. Further, we present a new method to associate mined blocks in the Monero blockchain to mining pools and uncover that Coinhive currently contributes 1.18% of mined blocks having turned over 1293 Moneros in June 2018.

DE Ethereum; DEVp2p; peer-to-peer computing; network measurement
AB Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency valued at a peak of $138 billion in 2018, is a decentralized, Turing-complete computing platform. Although the stability and security of Ethereum-and blockchain systems in general-have been widely-studied, most analysis has focused on application level features of these systems such as cryptographic mining challenges, smart contract semantics, or block mining operators. Little attention has been paid to the underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that are responsible for information propagation and that enable blockchain consensus. In this work, we develop NodeFinder to measure this previously opaque network at scale and illuminate the properties of its nodes. We analyze the Ethereum network from two vantage points: a three-month long view of nodes on the P2P network, and a single day snapshot of the Ethereum Mainnet peers. We uncover a noisy DEVp2p ecosystem in which fewer than half of all nodes contribute to the Ethereum Mainnet. Through a comparison with other previously studied P2P networks including BitTorrent, Gnutella, and Bitcoin, we find that Ethereum differs in both network size and geographical distribution.

AB Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency today, with a current market cap of over $68B. What sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies is that it uses the blockchain to not only store a record of transactions, but also smart contracts and a history of calls made to those contracts. Thus, Ethereum represents a new form of distributed system: one where users can implement contracts that can provide functionality such as voting protocols, crowdfunding projects, betting agreements, and many more. However, despite the massive investment, little is known about how contracts in Ethereum are actually created and used.
   In this paper, we examine how contracts in Ethereum are created, and how users and contracts interact with one another. We modify the geth client to log all such interactions, and find that contracts today are three times more likely to be created by other contracts than they are by users, and that over 60% of contracts have never been interacted with. Additionally, we obtain the bytecode of all contracts and look for similarity; we find that less than 10% of user-created contracts are unique, and less than 1% of contract-created contracts are so. Clustering the contracts based on code similarity reveals even further similarity. These results indicate that there is substantial code re-use in Ethereum, suggesting that bugs in such contracts could have wide-spread impact on the Ethereum user population.

DE Medicare; Blockchain technology; Game Theory; 'Medi-score'
AB At present, in China, the government plays a significant role in running the medicare system, while the commercial insurance acts as a supplement to it. With the aggravating trend of aging population, rising medical demands released from increasing health consciousness, and more occurrence of chronic diseases coming from the lifestyle change, as well as the medical technology progress, all these contribute the rapid rise of health care expense and the Medicare is under great pressure. As a result, the problem of inadequate and overly expensive medical services has become a hot topic.
   There is also unbalance in resource allocation in the social healthcare system, which can be attributed to the nature of insurance or healthcare, namely Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection. Still they are two unsolved questions. For example, it is common to see residents buy articles for daily use, cosmetics or heath products from designated pharmacies using their Medicare account. While many other people are unable to get timely and efficient treatment because they cannot afford it. What' s more, such abuse of Medicare also increases the operation cost of national healthcare system. Apart from Medicare, citizens could alternatively choose commercial insurance. Unfortunately, it is not a proper choice for the low-incomes. Therefore, it is important to find a way to solve this unbalance.
   According to the development of technology, Blockchain may well bring about a revolution in today's social medical insurance system. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology based on the principles of peer-to-peer network and cryptographic primitives (such as hash, asymmetric encryption and digital signature). Due to its immutability, transparency, and trustworthiness for all transactions executed in a blockchain network, this innovative technology has many potential applications.
   Individuals, families, medical institutions and the government all play a part in the Medicare. To make the most of the healthcare system, we have to put individual demand and feelings at first place. Having access to a ledger-shared, immutable, and transparent history of all the actions performed by participants of the network (such as a patient modifying permissions, a doctor accessing or uploading new data like prescriptions) overcome the issues presented above. In other words, blockchain technology could solve the problem of Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection, which is aroused from asymmetric information. At the same time, based on a peer-to-peer medical insurance network, Medicare could allocate resources more efficiently. This paper tends to analyze problems of the current social medical system and discuss the potential applications of blockchain technology in this field. By innovatively putting forth an idea of 'Medi-score', taking theories of insurance economics into account and discussing cases in other countries, we try to figure out a framework of our topic.

DE Video-on-Demand; Blockchain; Decentralized Architecture; Cryptocurrency
AB Video-on-Demand (VoD) service is currently one of the most lucrative business on the Internet. Most VoD services nowadays adopt a centralized-based architecture such that, service providers can have a total control over all system transactions (e.g., watched history, video royalty fee payment). The problem of a centralized-based architecture is the server-side bottleneck issue. The system maintenance cost for avoiding such an issue can be dramatically expensive. This maintenance cost can be reduced by adopting a decentralized-based architecture instead. However, the lack of a total control over user transactions in a decentralized-based architecture limits the capability of the service on being able to deploy commercially. In this study, we propose to apply Blockchain in a decentralized-based VoD service to overcome such a limitation. A new cryptocurrency so-called VoDCoin and its architecture design are proposed. The feasibility of our design is confirmed by means of experimentation in our Blockchain development testbed. Experiment results and open research challenges toward the practical deployment of VoDCoin are discussed at the end of this study.

AB The Blockchain technology is a disruptive technology that is changing the societal environment at various levels particularly the financial systems creating a new cryto-economy. There is dominant optimistic and praising view of the potentialities of the decentralized public ledgers. However most of the changes and cutting-edge impact of Blockchain technology remains misunderstood or unknown. This paper aims to propose a more critical perspective of the Blockchain implications highlighting the limitations, the controversies and the drawbacks of public distributed ledgers. An illustration from the monetary system is presented to propose an example of socio-economic implication. By presenting a case regarding the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system, which is now being, introduced as a counter policy against the emergence of the private crypto-currency system. We elaborate what CBDC is trying to solve and yet at the same time what potential problems might arise from this system. We conclude that the introduction of the Blockchain technology should be valued and evaluated in a more thorough way.

AB Many interesting news and activities are going on in the field of blockchain (sometimes called, Distributed Ledger Technology) related technologies like cryptocurrency, Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI, mostly Deep Learning). Not only developing countries but also developed countries need to be concerned about applying blockchain technology to their e-government system. Blockchain technology has brought a very deep innovation over conventional Client Server Trusted Third Party intermediary system to pure peer-to-peer (P2P) based smart contract system. This smart contract based peer-to-peer system allow participants to share data which was not possible under Client Server Trusted Third Party system due to architectural monopoly nature of Client Server. Smart contract concept brought logical conditions to share data among participants but it does not provide any definition about data value. This peer-to-peer based data sharing can be practically possible only under definition of value on data shared. If this definition is vague, then it will be very difficult to share data among participants. Also if this definition is clear, data sharing participants can get much benefit from this data sharing. This data sharing will be only effective from blockchain based architecture.

AB In the period of 2006-2011 Georgia enjoyed the status of "world's top reformer" and World Bank recognised that one of the key success factors that made Georgian governments efforts so powerful, is Harnessing Technology [1]. Although e-Goventment was not, per se, high political goal and strategic direction for Georgian reformers, but it quickly became the integral part and key enabler of whole public administration reform process. This paper analysis one of the modern and notable example of Georgian innovative and secure e-Government solution - property ownership guaranteed by blockchain technology [2]. The analysis highlight prerequisites for implementing such a solution, its main features, system description and core enabled results of blockchain-managed property registration system. The paper makes a generic conclusion that blockchain-based ownership registry is a key driver for both developing and developed information societies (e.g.: Brazil, Sweden) [3] in order to ensure transparency and reliability of government-owned registration systems and increase trust in them, as well as enhance enforcement of rule of law, protection of basic proprietary human rights, reduce costs and increase efficiency and effectiveness of registration process. The aim of this paper is two-fold: to identify the Georgian country-specific solution for legal validity and presumption of proof of property ownership and to add the Georgian experience for a future cross-country comparative studies.

AB The ability of blockchain technology to record transactions on distributed ledgers offers new opportunities for governments to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and establish trust in the public sector. However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.

ID DESIGN
AB The blockchain technology has evolved beyond traditional payment solutions in the finance sector and offers a potential for transforming many sectors including the public sector. The novel integration of technology and economy that open public blockchains have brought represents both challenges to and opportunities for enhancing digital public services. So far, the public sector has lagged behind other sectors in both research and exploration of this technology, but pilot cases show that there is a great potential for reforming and even transforming public service delivery.
   We argue that the open blockchain technology is best understood as a possible information infrastructure, given its universal, evolving, open and transparent nature. A comparison with Internet is meaningful despite obvious differences between the two. Based on some case studies, we have developed an analytical framework for better understanding the potential benefits as well as the existing challenges when introducing blockchain technology in the public sector.

AB Blockchain technology is the underlying enabling technology developed for Bitcoin, the most common cryptocurrency. Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular with the potential to become a powerful disruptive force. Individuals and organizations may benefit from blockchain with its ability to increase secure data exchange and to make that transaction simpler and easier between entities. We investigate factors that influence an individual's intention to use a blockchain cryptocurrency. We develop a model of cryptocurrency adoption grounded in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to: identify the determinants for the acceptance of cryptocurrency and explore the relative importance of each construct. We offer empirical evidence for a better theoretical understanding of cryptocurrency adoption with practical implications in an e-government context.

DE Blockchain Technology; Institutions; Trust; Control; Governance
AB Blockchain Technology is considered as a general-purpose technology with far reaching effects. As can be seen from the discussions on blockchain applications, both practitioners and researchers struggle to get to the core of blockchain technology consequences. Especially practitioners in the governmental sector explore adequate responses to this new technology. Therefore, our aim is to provide a conceptualization of the consequences of blockchain systems from an institutional perspective, and to use this conceptualization to provide insights into the governance of blockchain systems.
   We use a Grounded Theory approach to conceptualize the institutional consequences of blockchain technology. This approach leads to our core category: power transfer in environments with highly institutionalized values.
   This core category supports the synthetization of the governance issues related to blockchain systems. We conclude that the controlling powers that were formerly vested in highly institutionalized organizations (such as governments and regulators) and institutions (such as legal frameworks and agreements), are no longer automatically part of the governing ecosystem in blockchain systems but are engrained into the technical system itself Thus, Blockchain technology enables the technological institutionalization of values in environments that are highly dependent on these values. We believe that this is at the core of why existing institutions are being pressured by blockchain technology, and as such increase the difficulty for governments to effectively govern blockchain systems.
   Using this notion, public and private parties within the blockchain ecosystems can develop regulatory arrangements and strategies that strike a balance between fostering the innovative power and possibilities that blockchain applications offer and to mitigate possible negative effects of blockchain technology.

The goal of the project is to simulate the application of IoT devices in smart city initiatives, and explore how IoT data management could benefit from Blockchain technology. In this project, there are three basic questions we are attempting to answer. 1) How do you link various kinds of IoT devices to the Blockchain, as they have different computing capabilities? 2) How do you store data on Blockchain from different IoT devices, and retrieve data for further utilization? 3) To what extent, smart contracts can be designed to implement automated data access management?

DE Blockchain; Smart Contracts; Corruption Levels; Governance
AB The increasing demands for more transparency in public administration worldwide ask for open data, and the establishing of other mechanisms as well as keep using the contributions of new technologies to increment the management capacity, focusing on better controls and governance mechanisms. One of the new technologies that presents potential to be used to protect organizations from corruption is Blockchain. An important point when dealing with corruption perpetrated by frauds is the use of technology to avoid wrongdoing or to reduce its impact. Contracts are a very complex subject provided they are the main way governments transfer money to other organizations, including private ones. This document presents a study proposal about the use of Smart Contracts technology in Blockchain environments as a way to face corruption in governmental instances. Smart Contracts can be used to all government payments as a way to increase transactions transparency, as well as to avoid overbilling, provided that contracts and bids are typical ways to exert frauds and money misappropriation. As future researches it is important to verify barriers to Blockchain adoption as well as its main vulnerabilities.

   Structured Case-Study Approach
AB Blockchain technology (BC) is a new technology that can potentially bring value to governments by providing public services in a more direct and distributed manner. The vast majority of nontechnical literature related to blockchain technology, especially in public sector, focuses on the landscaping of use cases. The major drawback of the landscaping approach is that it is speculative and often done without a reference to empirical evidence. Our research aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art and provide insights into the economic constraints and effects of blockchain implementations in public sector based on empirical evidence. Our poster presents the identified true drivers of cost and benefits and explores potential policy steps that the European Union could explore to capture the full benefits of blockchain technology for the public sector.

AB In the past few years, researchers and practitioners have highlighted the potential of Blockchain (BC) and distributed ledger technology to revolutionize government processes. Blockchain technology enables distributed power and embedded security. As such, Blockchain is regarded as an innovative, general purpose technology, offering new ways of organization in many domains, including e-government for transactions and information exchange. However, due to its very characteristics of peer to peer information exchange, its distributed nature, the still developing technology, the involvement of new actors, roles, etc., the implementation of blockchain applications raise issues that need governance attention. BC initiatives have implications for citizen trust, privacy, inclusion and participation. Governmental organizations need a thorough understanding of the BC design principles, the possible applications in the domain of e-government and the exploration of governance mechanisms to deal with the limitations and challenges of the BC technology when used in a myriad of sectors, ranging from the financial and business sector to the social domains of healthcare and education. In this panel we explore the impact of block chain technology on all levels of government and create an awareness of effects or applications in society that raise governance issues.

DE CPU Security; Vulnerability Detection; Comprehensive Benchmark
AB The current electronic-economy is booming, electronic-wallets, encrypted virtual-money, mobile payments, and other new generations of economic instruments are springing up. As the most important cornerstone, CPU is facing serious security challenges. And with the blowout of actual application requirements, the importance of CPU security testing is increasing. However, the actual security threats to computer systems are also becoming increasingly rampant (now attackers often use multiple different types of vulnerabilities to construct complex attack systems, not just a single attack chain). The traditional vulnerability detection model is not capable of comprehensive security assessment.
   We first proposed a comprehensive CPU Security Benchmark solution with high coverage for existing known vulnerabilities, including Undocumented Instructions detection, Control Flow Integrity test, Memory Errors detection, and Cache Side Channels detection, Out of Order and Speculative execution vulnerabilities (Meltdown and Spectre series) tests, and more. Our benchmark provides meaningful and constructive feedbacks for evading architecture/microarchitecture design flaws, system security (OS and libraries) software patches design, and user programming vulnerabilities tips.
   We hope that the work of this paper will promote the computer system security testing from the past scatter point and line mode (single specific vulnerability and attack chain testing) to coordinated and whole surface mode (multi-type vulnerabilities and attack network testing), thus creating a new research direction of the comprehensive and balanced CPU Security Benchmark. Our test suite will play an inspiring role in the comprehensive assessment of security in personal computer devices (PC/Mobile Phone) and large server clusters (Servers/Cloud), as well as the construction of more secure Block-Chain nodes (IOT), and many other practical applications.

DE Bitcoin; Mining; Selfish mining; N-attackers
AB Selfish mining is a well-known mining attack strategy discovered by Eyal and Sirer in 2014. After that, the attackers' strategy has been further discussed by many other works, which analyze the strategy and behavior of a single attacker. The extension of the strategy research is greatly restricted by the assumption that there is only one attacker in the blockchain network, since, in many cases, a proof of work blockchain has multiple attackers. The attackers can be independent of others instead of sharing information and attacking the blockchain as a whole. In this paper, we will establish a new model to analyze the miners' behavior in a proof of work blockchain with multiple attackers. Based on our model, we extend the attackers' strategy by proposing a new strategy set publish-n. Meanwhile, we will also review other attacking strategies such as selfish mining and stubborn mining in our model to explore whether these strategies work or not when there are multiple attackers. The performances of different strategies are compared using relative stale block rate of the attackers. In a proof of work blockchain model with two attackers, strategy publish- n can beat selfish mining by up to 26.3%.

AB In this paper, we highlight a new form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that impacts the memory pools of cryptocurrency systems causing massive transaction backlog and higher mining fees. Towards that, we study such an attack on Bitcoin mempools and explore its effects on the mempool size and transaction fees paid by the legitimate users. We also propose countermeasures to contain such an attack. Our countermeasures include fee -based and age -based designs, which optimize the mempool size and help to counter the effects of DDoS attacks. We evaluate our designs using simulations in diverse attack conditions.

AB As interest in cryptocurrency has increased, problems have arisen with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) methods, the most representative methods of acquiring cryptocurrency in a blockchain. The PoW method is uneconomical and the PoS method can be easily monopolized by a few people. To cope with this issue, this paper introduces a Proof-of-Probability (PoP) method. The PoP is a method where each node sorts the encrypted actual hash as well as a number of fake hash, and then the first node to decrypt actual hash creates block. In addition, a wait time is used when decrypting one hash and then decrypting the next hash for restricting the excessive computing power competition. In addition, the centralization by validaters with many stakes can be avoided in the proposed PoP method.

AB Blockchain is an emerging infrastructural technology that is proposed to fundamentally transfoun the ways in which people transact, trust, collaborate, organize and identify themselves. In this paper, we construct a typology of emerging blockchain applications, consider the domains in which they are applied, and identify distinguishing features of this new technology. We argue that there is a unique role for the HCI community in linking the design and application of blockchain technology towards lived experience and the articulation of human values. In particular, we note how the accounting of transactions, a trust in immutable code and algorithms, and the leveraging of distributed crowds and publics around vast interoperable databases all relate to longstanding issues of importance for the field. We conclude by highlighting core conceptual and methodological challenges for HCI researchers beginning to work with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.

AB Design and HCI researchers are increasingly working with complex digital infrastructures, such as cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers and smart contracts. These technologies will have a profound impact on digital systems and their audiences. However, given their emergent nature and technical complexity, involving non-specialists in the design of applications that employ these technologies is challenging. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and present GeoCoin, a location-based platform for embodied learning and speculative ideating with smart contracts. In collaborative workshops with GeoCoin, participants engaged with location-based smart contracts, using the platform to explore digital 'debit' and 'credit' zones in the city. These exercises led to the design of diverse distributed-ledger applications, for time-limited financial unions, participatory budgeting, and humanitarian aid. These results contribute to the HCI community by demonstrating how an experiential prototype can support understanding of the complexities behind new digital infrastructures and facilitate participant engagement in ideation and design processes.

AB Smart contracts enable autonomous decentralized organizations (DAOs) in large, trustless and open trading networks by specifying conditions for automated transactions of cryptographically secured data. This data could represent cryptocurrencies but also sensor data or commands to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) connected to the Internet. To provide reliability, the contract code is enforced by consensus and the transactions it triggers are non-revertible, even if they were not intended by the programmer, which could lead to dangerous system behavior.
   In this paper, we conduct a survey over existing smart contract platforms and languages to determine requirements for the design of a safer contract language. Subsequently we propose concepts that enhance the understanding of code by limiting confusing language constructs, such as nesting, arbitrary naming of operations, and unreadable hash identifiers. This enables human reasoning about the contract semantics on a much higher abstraction layer, because a common understanding can be derived from the language specification itself.
   We implement these concepts in a new domain specific language called SmaCoNat to illustrate the feasibility and show that our concepts are barely covered by existing languages but significantly enhance readability and safety without violating deterministic parsability.

ID ACCESS-CONTROL
AB Authorization, and more generally Trust Management (TM), is an indispensable part of the correct operation of most IT systems. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with its cyber-physical and distributed nature, creates new challenges, that existing TM systems cannot adequately address, such as for example the need for non-interactive exclusive access enforcement. In the meantime, a line of thought in the research community is that Distributed Ledgers (DLs), like the one implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, can provide strong security guarantees for distributed access control. However, this approach has not yet been examined in a scientific, systematic manner, and has many pitfalls, with arguably the most important one being scalability.
   In this paper, we critically explore the shortcomings of existing solutions for trust management in distributed networks, pinpoint which of these shortcomings can be addressed by utilizing DLs, and offer a conceptual design for a scalable, secure TM system. Our design approaches the problem in three layers, namely a global, an intermediate group or shard layer, and a local layer, corresponding to the set of embedded devices behind an internet access point. We view our design as a novel first step, helping the community to produce more secure and realistic authorization solutions for the IoT, in the near future.

AB We present hamm, a Haskell library that enables programmers to easily configure authenticated map (key-value store) implementations. We use type level programming techniques to establish an extensible foundation, and provide an example base map and several example "add on" transformers supporting features such as caches, Bloom filters and paging structures. Another add-on enables a prover to provide-and a verifier to verify-a "summary" containing only a small subset of the map's data, and a verifier to receive and verify additional data only if needed. Preliminary performance results demonstrate significant potential for authenticated maps configured using hamm to support our goal of enabling participants to join blockchain networks faster.

AB We present a server-supported, hash-based digital signature scheme. To achieve greater efficiency than current state of the art, we relax the security model somewhat. We postulate a set of design requirements, discuss some approaches and their practicality, and finally reach a forward-secure scheme with only modest trust assumptions, achieved by employing the concepts of authenticated data structures and blockchains. The concepts of blockchain authenticated data structures and the presented blockchain design could have independent value and are worth further research.

   Distributed Ledger Technologies
AB Blockchains and distributed ledger technology (DLT) that rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW) typically show limited performance. Several recent approaches incorporate Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols in their DLT design as Byzantine consensus allows for increased performance and energy efficiency, as well as it offers proven liveness and safety properties. While there has been a broad variety of research on BFT consensus protocols over the last decades, those protocols were originally not intended to scale for a large number of nodes. Thus, the quest for scalable BFT consensus was initiated with the emerging research interest in DLT. In this paper, we first provide a broad analysis of various optimization techniques and approaches used in recent protocols to scale Byzantine consensus for large environments such as BFT blockchain infrastructures. We then present an overview of both efforts and assumptions made by existing protocols and compare their solutions.

AB Could smart contracts written in Solidity, a popular language among blockchain developers for Ethereum, be run on other blockchain platforms such as Hyperleger Fabric. To run Solidity smart contracts on another blockchain platform, one can either incorporate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the target blockchain, or perform a source-to-source translation of the Solidity contracts to a smart contract language for the target platform. This paper presents Sol2js, an open source source-to-source translation tool that generates Javascript smart contracts for Hyperledger Fabric from Solidity contracts, and provides a conceptual mapping of Ethereum constructs to that of Hyperleger Fabric, where possible. Presently, the tool is able to successfully translate 65-70% of Solidity constructs including major types, functions, inheritance, and events. The preliminary results show that the average of the lines of code (loc) across translated contracts is 7.5x more than the average of Solidity contracts loc while preserving contract semantics.

AB The success and growing popularity of blockchain technology has lead to a significant increase in load on popular permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum. With the current design, these blockchain systems do not scale with additional nodes since every node executes every transaction. Further efforts are therefore necessary to develop scalable permissionless blockchain systems. In this paper, we provide an aggregated overview of the current research on the Ethereum blockchain towards solving the scalability challenge. We focus on the concept of sharding, which aims to break the restriction of every participant being required to execute every transaction and store the entire state. This concept however introduces new complexities in the form of stateless clients, which leads to a new challenge: how to guarantee that critical data is published and stays available for as long as it is relevant. We present an approach towards solving the data availability problem (DAP) that leverages synergy effects by reusing the validators from Casper. We then propose two distinct approaches for reliable collation proposal, state transition, and state verification in shard chains. One approach is based on verification by committees of Casper validators that execute transactions in proposed blocks using witness data provided by executors. The other approach relies on a proof of execution provided by the executor proposing the block and a challenge game, where other executors verify the proof. Both concepts rely on executors for long-term storage of shard chain state.

AB This short paper proposes the potential effect on individuals' behavioural intention to adopt blockchain technology. It recognises the importance of blockchain and its associate Bitcoin, and it seeks to shed light on the factors that enable or challenge individuals' behavioural intention to utilise the new phenomena. In particular, this study argues there are three potential dimensions in which one's behavioural intention can be impacted. It suggests that the behavioural intention to adopt blockchain technology is associated with perceived risk, perceived value, and personal innovativeness. This study provides an opportunity for future research to validate the proposed model and suggests a plan to conduct such verification.

AB As blockchain became popular technology, This short paper proposes the potential effect of different groups of people on individuals' behavioural intention to embrace this technology. Social influence in previous studies shows a significant impact on individuals toward adopting new technologies. To understand the effect of different group of people namely family, friends and community on intention to utilise the new phenomena is the purpose of this proposed paper. Considering the growing interest in the use of Bitcoins through blockchain technology, we argue that the lack of studies on social influence on Bitcoins adoption will contribute significantly to bridge a gap in the literature and provide a research opportunity to contextualise the effect of social influence and broaden its dimensions to include several influence channels. This study provides an opportunity for a future research to validate the proposed model and suggests the plan to conduct such verification.

DE insurance; technology; evolution; claim; risk
AB In just a few short years, the application of tech to the traditional insurance market has caused industry-wide change. A great number of exciting businesses now offer alternatives to traditional providers. The threat to their dominance is real, highlighted by the fact that three in four insurers believe their business is at risk of disruption from insurtech. 86% know they must innovate to remain competitive. Staying the same is not an option. Traditional providers, who offered all types of insurance, are being challenged by providers who cater for niche needs. Typical insurtech users are digitally-savvy consumers, so insurtech businesses are focusing on the retail segment, with 75% servicing this sector. As McKinsey says, "for plugged-in cohorts, the use of 24/7 digital channels to receive an insurance quote or submit a claim is infinitely preferable to a branch visit". And these needs are being met by insurtech businesses delivering highly personalised, engaging, digital solutions. Excitingly, insurtech is embracing innovative new technologies, too. In time, AI and blockchain will offer peerless security and trust, making them even more compelling for a generation of users who have grown up using tech for everything from banking to transportation to dating. Considering the importance of insurtech for insurance companies, this paper is aimed to highlight the main directions insurtech actions in the present and the main directions likely be followed the near future.

AB This research aims at exploring the blockchain technology role in the national innovation system development and defining its application areas in the Russian Federation. The current condition of the Russian national innovation system has been studied; some weaknesses and opportunities for improvement have been revealed. The structure and main advantages of the blockchain technology have been covered, prospective areas for its applications have been explored and some difficulties, associated with its implementation, have been detected. The Russian society's and authorities' position on the blockchain technology implementation in the country has been clarified, which was essential, in order to make sure that this technology can be used in the Russian Federation. By using the regression analysis, the relationship between the blockchain application and the national innovation system development indicators (namely, the venture capital deals), has been analyzed, in order to test a particular way of using blockchain for the country's welfare. Finally, the perspectives of the Russian national innovation system development, based on the blockchain technology application in finance, have been defined. This work is considered as relevant, as it can serve as an information basis for forming the Russian national innovation system development policy.

AB The development of interaction between all interested participants in innovation system is a crucial mechanism of digital transformation of the economy. The authors emphasize that innovation process participants should collaborate without hindrance, accumulate experience from completing joint projects intended to create and commercialize innovations. Understanding how culture affects collaborative behavior in a multicultural context is critical to improving performance in today's organizations. The paper examines the comparison of the cross-cultural analysis of Australia and Russia. Based on the results of the analysis, it shows how a small business from Russia overcomes barriers in Australia through the application of blockchain technology. The authors hope that examples of development and thoughts about the driving sources of these transformations, chosen by taking into account the interests of the development of the Russian digital economy, can be interesting and useful for Russian enterprises, small businesses that have begun their digital transformations.

AB Recent advances in quantum computer technology and Shor algorithms have increased the importance of new data integrity verification for the security of existing public key cryptography. Keyless signature can perform high-speed data integrity verification using only hash operation and immunity to quantum computer using One Time Password(OTP). Keyless Signature Infrastructure(KSI) is an environment for Keyless Signature. It provides user certificate creation through distributed network server and block time chain global time stamp token for message integrity. However, when a large number of users are added to the KSI and the OTP is managed, the number of end nodes increases, which increases the KSI overhead. In this paper, we propose a KSI system that reduces overhead by efficiently merging a large number of nodes by applying multi path hash chain. Finally, we proposed universal hashing function so that improved secure KSI system.

DE Blockchain; Consensus Rule; internet of things; Supply chain; Cold chain
AB As in 2009 the first encrypted electronic currency Bitcoin is introduced, the block chain technology has received attention. Bitcoin is a currency issued without a trusted third party, in peer-to-peer (Peer-to-Peer) network and gives a guarantee of the reliability of money transactions, ensures the integrity of transactions. There is a back end-technique called block-chain that guarantees these without trusted third party. Block chain is a public ledger that all nodes to verify transactions and maintain integrity with the same ledger. Block chain technology applies not only electronic currency but also in various industries such as contract document integrity, cloud storage service, internet of thigns, supply chain for transaction integrity. However, there are problems to be solved if the bitcoin block chain consensus rule is applied to these industry. First, there is problem of low transaction throughput and block generation rate by an inefficient consensus rule. Second, There is problem of tampered block broadcast with non-dependency (internet of things data, food history data) transactions when applying the block chain consensus rule, which is proof-of-work of bitcoin's competitive system.
   To solve these problems, we propose new blockchain consensus algorithm for non-dependency transactions. In this paper, the blockchain transactions targeted internet of things data and food history. We propose consensus rule based voting for the efficiency, also propose method of imposing difficulty of block generation according to the voting result in order to prevent malicious node attacks. We provide experimental results on attack malicious node in the block chain implemented by the proposed consensus algorithms and the result is analyzed

AB The present experimental study investigated a flexible floating anti-collision system consisting of block chains, buoys, mooring chains, and gravity anchors. The motions of the central buoy and tensions of the block and mooring chains were measured under random waves with normal incidence. The results showed that both the motion and tension amplitudes increased with the incident significant wave height, but the increment decreased due to the effect of the nonlinear mooring chains. The edge mooring chain and block chain appeared to dominate the characteristics of the multi-frequencies, which can mainly be attributed to the sway motion of the buoys as well as the relative movements of the coupled buoys. The surge motion was found to contribute to the tension responses on the edge mooring chain due to the oscillation of the system in the axial direction.

TI A Distributed Ledger for Supply Chain Physical Distribution Visibility

AB Supply chains (SC) span many geographies, modes and industries and involve several phases where data flows in both directions from suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, to customers. This data flow is necessary to support critical business decisions that may impact product cost and market share. Current SC information systems are unable to provide validated, pseudo real-time shipment tracking during the distribution phase. This information is available from a single source, often the carrier, and is shared with other stakeholders on an as-needed basis. This paper introduces an independent, crowd-validated, online shipment tracking framework that complements current enterprise-based SC management solutions. The proposed framework consists of a set of private distributed ledgers and a single blockchain public ledger. Each private ledger allows the private sharing of custody events among the trading partners in a given shipment. Privacy is necessary, for example, when trading high-end products or chemical and pharmaceutical products. The second type of ledger is a blockchain public ledger. It consists of the hash code of each private event in addition to monitoring events. The latter provide an independently validated immutable record of the pseudo real-time geolocation status of the shipment from a large number of sources using commuters-sourcing.

AB The installed capacity of distributed generation (DG) based on renewable energy sources has increased continuously in power systems, and its market-oriented transaction is imperative. However, traditional transaction management based on centralized organizations has many disadvantages, such as high operation cost, low transparency, and potential risk of transaction data modification. Therefore, a decentralized electricity transaction mode for microgrids is proposed in this study based on blockchain and continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. A buyer and seller initially complete the transaction matching in the CDA market. In view of the frequent price fluctuation in the CDA market, an adaptive aggressiveness strategy is used to adjust the quotation timely according to market changes. DG and consumer exchange digital certificate of power and expenditure on the blockchain system and the interests of consumers are then guaranteed by multi-signature when DG cannot generate power due to failure or other reasons. The digital certification of electricity assets is replaced by the sequence number with specific tags in the transaction script, and the size of digital certification can be adjusted according to transaction energy quantity. Finally, the feasibility of market mechanism through specific microgrid case and settlement process is also provided.

AB Blockchain ledgers and the Cloud are a perfect match. On the one hand, there is an inherent requirement for multiple separate authentication nodes to validate every Blockchain transaction with each node requiring substantial encryption calculation capability. On the other hand, massive economies of scale can bring down the cost per transaction, and provide service continuity. Additionally, the Cloud provides a perfect incubator for proof-of-concept projects. This paper considers the future implications of Blockchain, as the concept of disintermediated trustless ledgers stimulates the imagination of computer scientists and innovators. The Cloud's role in implementing this new paradigm is also highlighted, as a new decentralized P2P-Cloud model. Finally, this paper discusses how Blockchain may be integrated into the university level computer science and information technology curriculum.

TI Blockchain-Empowered Fair Computational Resource Sharing System in the

SO FUTURE INTERNET
LA English

DE D2D communication; blockchain; fairness; connectivity-aware
AB Device-to-device (D2D) communication is becoming an increasingly important technology in future networks with the climbing demand for local services. For instance, resource sharing in the D2D network features ubiquitous availability, flexibility, low latency and low cost. However, these features also bring along challenges when building a satisfactory resource sharing system in the D2D network. Specifically, user mobility is one of the top concerns for designing a cooperative D2D computational resource sharing system since mutual communication may not be stably available due to user mobility. A previous endeavour has demonstrated and proven how connectivity can be incorporated into cooperative task scheduling among users in the D2D network to effectively lower average task execution time. There are doubts about whether this type of task scheduling scheme, though effective, presents fairness among users. In other words, it can be unfair for users who contribute many computational resources while receiving little when in need. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based credit system that can be incorporated into the connectivity-aware task scheduling scheme to enforce fairness among users in the D2D network. Users' computational task cooperation will be recorded on the public blockchain ledger in the system as transactions, and each user's credit balance can be easily accessible from the ledger. A supernode at the base station is responsible for scheduling cooperative computational tasks based on user mobility and user credit balance. We investigated the performance of the credit system, and simulation results showed that with a minor sacrifice of average task execution time, the level of fairness can obtain a major enhancement.

AB Service commissions, which are claimed by Ad-Networks and Publishers, are susceptible to forgery as non-human operators are able to artificially create fictitious traffic on digital platforms for the purpose of committing financial fraud. This places a significant strain on Advertisers who have no effective means of differentiating fabricated Ad-Reports from those which correspond to real consumer activity. To address this problem, we contribute an advert reporting system which utilizes opportunistic networking and a blockchain-inspired construction in order to identify authentic Ad-Reports by determining whether they were composed by honest or dishonest users. What constitutes a user's honesty for our system is the manner in which they access adverts on their mobile device. Dishonest users submit multiple reports over a short period of time while honest users behave as consumers who view adverts at a balanced pace while engaging in typical social activities such as purchasing goods online, moving through space and interacting with other users. We argue that it is hard for dishonest users to fake honest behaviour and we exploit the behavioural patterns of users in order to classify Ad-Reports as real or fabricated. By determining the honesty of the user who submitted a particular report, our system offers a more secure reward-claiming model which protects against fraud while still preserving the user's anonymity.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency based on a peer-to-peer payment system managed by an open source software and characterized by lower transaction costs, greater security and scalability than fiat money and no need of a central bank. Despite criticisms about illegal uses and social consequences, it is attracting the interest of the scientific community. The purpose of this work is to define and evaluate the current trends of the literature concerned with the sustainability of bitcoin, considering the environmental impacts, social issues and economic aspects. From the analysis it emerges that the transition of the whole monetary system in the new cryptocurrency will result in an unacceptable amount of energy consumed to mine new bitcoins and to maintain the entire virtual monetary system, and probably bitcoin will remain a niche currency. Blockchain, which is the base for a distributed and democratically-sustained public ledger of the transactions, could foster new and challenging opportunities. Sharing the framework of medical data, energy generation and distribution in micro-grids at the citizen level, block-stack and new state-driven cryptocurrencies, may benefit from the wide spread of blockchain-based transactions. Under the perspective of its being a driver of social change, bitcoins and related blockchain technologies may overcome the issues highlighted by numerous detractors.

AB The know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence process is outdated and generates costs of up to USD 500 million per year per bank. The authors propose a new system, based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), that reduces the costs of the core KYC verification process for financial institutions and improves the customer experience. In the proposed system, the core KYC verification process is only conducted once for each customer, regardless of the number of financial institutions with which that customer intends to work. Thanks to DLT, the result of the core KYC verification can be securely shared by customers with all the financial institutions that they intend to work with. This system allows for efficiency gains, cost reduction, improved customer experience, and increased transparency throughout the process of onboarding a customer.

AB Since its introduction in 2008, blockchain technology has outgrown its use in cryptocurrencies and is now preparing to revolutionize a multitude of commercial applications including value and supply chains, business models, and market structures. This work follows design science research to guide the implementation of a blockchain-based proof-of-concept prototype that enables the automated transaction of real-world assets, such as cars, and provides a valid, transparent, and immutable record of vehicle history to market participants, authorities, and other third parties. The contribution of this study to existing research is threefold: First, it introduces a built-in mechanism to reduce transaction risk resulting from the irreversibility of transactions in blockchain-based systems. Second, it replaces a trust-based, centralized, and bureaucratic register with a tamper-free and autonomous transactional database system that comprises a secure registration and transaction process. Third, it proposes a novel approach to mitigate adverse selection effects in lemon markets by providing a reliable, transparent, and complete record of each marketable asset's history. In total, the findings in this article illustrate the potential of blockchain-based systems but also highlight technological shortcomings and challenges for commercial applications, such as scalability or privacy issues.

ID SCHEME
AB As modern vehicle and communication technologies advanced apace, people begin to believe that the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) would be achievable in one decade. ITS introduces information technology to the transportation infrastructures and aims to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, security is still a main concern in vehicular communication systems (VCSs). This can be addressed through secured group broadcast. Therefore, secure key management schemes are considered as a critical technique for network security. In this paper, we propose a framework for providing secure key management within the heterogeneous network. The security managers (SMs) play a key role in the framework by capturing the vehicle departure information, encapsulating block to transport keys and then executing rekeying to vehicles within the same security domain. The first part of this framework is a novel network topology based on a decentralized blockchain structure. The blockchain concept is proposed to simplify the distributed key management in heterogeneous VCS domains. The second part of the framework uses the dynamic transaction collection period to further reduce the key transfer time during vehicles handover. Extensive simulations and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, in which the blockchain structure performs better in term of key transfer time than the structure with a central manager, while the dynamic scheme allows SMs to flexibly fit various traffic levels.

AB Swift developments in the emerging field of blockchain technology have facilitated the birth of 'smart contracts': computerised transaction protocols which autonomously execute the terms of a contract. Smart contracts are disintermediated and generally transparent in nature, offering the promise of increased commercial efficiency, lower transaction and legal costs, and anonymous transacting. The business world is actively investigating the use of blockchain technology for various commercial purposes. Whilst questions surround the security and reliability of this technology, and the negative impact it may have upon traditional intermediaries, there are equally significant concerns that smart contracts will encounter considerable difficulty adapting to current legal frameworks regulating contracts across jurisdictions. This article considers the potential issues with legal and practical enforceability that arise from the use of smart contracts within both civil and common law jurisdictions.

AB Personal privacy protection issues has gradually caused widespread concern in society which will lead to economic and reputation losses, hinder network and E-commerce innovation or some other consequences if not handled properly. In this paper, we make use of the de-centralization, permanent and audibility of the blockchain to propose a blockchain-based personal privacy protection mechanism, which uses Online taxi-hailing as the application scenario. We not only provide the details of the blockchain custom transaction domain used by the scene, but also expound the information exchanging and blockchain auditing between passengers, Online taxi-hailing platform and drivers in Online taxi-hailing scene, providing a case model for the blockchain solution to personal privacy protection and a technical mechanism solution for further study of personal privacy protection issues.

AB In this article, we introduce a prototype of an innovative technology for proving the origins of captured digital media. In an era of fake news, when someone shows us a video or picture of some event, how can we trust its authenticity? It seems that the public no longer believe that traditional media is a reliable reference of fact, perhaps due, in part, to the onset of many diverse sources of conflicting information, via social media. Indeed, the issue of fake reached a crescendo during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, when the winner, Donald Trump, claimed that The New York Times was trying to discredit him by pushing disinformation. Current research into overcoming the problem of fake news does not focus on establishing the ownership of media resources used in such storiesthe blockchain-based application introduced in this article is technology that is capable of indicating the authenticity of digital media. Put simply, using the trust mechanisms of blockchain technology, the tool can show, beyond doubt, the provenance of any source of digital media, including images used out of context in attempts to mislead. Although the application is an early prototype and its capability to find fake resources is somewhat limited, we outline future improvements that would overcome such limitations. Furthermore, we believe that our application (and its use of blockchain technology and standardized metadata) introduces a novel approach to overcoming falsities in news reporting and the provenance of media resources used therein. However, while our application has the potential to be able to verify the originality of media resources, we believe that technology is only capable of providing a partial solution to fake news. That is because it is incapable of proving the authenticity of a news story as a whole. We believe that takes human skills.

TI From blockchain technology to global health equity: can cryptocurrencies
   finance universal health coverage?
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies could remake global health financing and usher in an era global health equity and universal health coverage. We outline and provide examples for at least four important ways in which this potential disruption of traditional global health funding mechanisms could occur: universal access to financing through direct transactions without third parties; novel new multilateral financing mechanisms; increased security and reduced fraud and corruption; and the opportunity for open markets for healthcare data that drive discovery and innovation. We see these issues as a paramount to the delivery of healthcare worldwide and relevant for payers and providers of healthcare at state, national and global levels; for government and non-governmental organisations; and for global aid organisations, including the WHO, International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.

AB While blockchain technology is commonly considered potentially disruptive in various regards, there is a lack of understanding where and how blockchain technology is effectively applicable and where it has mentionable practical effects. This issue has given rise to critical voices that judge the technology as over-hyped. Against this backdrop, this study adapts an established research framework to structure the insights of the current body of research on blockchain technology, outline the present research scope as well as disregarded topics, and sketch out multidisciplinary research approaches. The framework differentiates three groups of activities (design and features, measurement and value, management and organization) at four levels of analysis (users and society, intermediaries, platforms, firms and industry). The review shows that research has predominantly focused on technological questions of design and features, while neglecting application, value creation, and governance. In order to foster substantial blockchain research that addresses meaningful questions, this study identifies several avenues for future studies. Given the breadth of open questions, it shows where research can benefit from multidisciplinary collaborations and presents data sources as starting points for empirical investigations.

AB In financial markets it is common for companies and individuals to invest into foreign companies. To avoid the double taxation of investors on dividend payment - both in the country where the profit is generated as well as the country of residence - most governments have entered into bilateral double taxation treaties, whereby investors can claim a tax refund in the country where the profit is generated. Due to easily forgeable documents and insufficient international exchange of information between tax authorities, investors illegitimately apply for these tax returns causing an estimated damage of 1.8 billion USD, for example, in Denmark alone. This paper assesses the potential of a blockchain database to provide a feasible solution for overcoming this problem against the backdrop of recent advances in the public sector and the unique set of blockchain capacities. Towards this end, we develop and evaluate a blockchain-based prototype system aimed at eliminating this type of tax fraud and increasing transparency regarding the flow of dividends. While the prototype is based on the specific context of the Danish tax authority, we discuss how it can be generalized for tracking international and interorganizational transactions.

AB The paper investigates financial contract management on distributed ledgers and provides a working solution implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The system is based on a domain-specific language for financial contracts that is capable of expressing complex multi-party derivatives and is conducive to automated execution. The authors propose an architecture for separating contractual terms from contract execution: a contract evaluator encapsulates the syntax and semantics of financial contracts without actively performing contractual actions; such actions are handled by user-definable contract managers that administer strategies for the execution of contracts. Hosting contracts and contract managers on a distributed ledger, side-by-side with digital assets, facilitates automated settlement of commitments without the need for an intermediary. The paper discusses how the proposed technology may change the way financial institutions, regulators, and individuals interact in a financial system based on distributed ledgers.

AB The development of Financial Technology (FinTech) in areas such as mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, search engines, and blockchain technology have significantly changed the financial industry. FinTech is expected to overturn the traditional banking business model, forcing banks to upgrade and transform. This study adopts a comparative case study method to contrast and analyze the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Citibank. It analyzes the strategies, organizations, HR systems, and product innovations adopted by these two banks in response to the impact of FinTech. This paper proposes an "electric vehicle" mode for ICBC and an "airplane mode" for Citibank. Further, it describes the difficulties encountered by the Chinese banking industry and proposes some feasible ways to upgrade. "Technology power" will become the core competitive concept for the financial institutions of the future.

AB Interconnected smart vehicles offer a range of sophisticated services that benefit the vehicle owners, transport authorities, car manufacturers, and other service providers. This potentially exposes smart vehicles to a range of security and privacy threats such as location tracking or remote hijacking of the vehicle. In this article, we argue that blockchain (BC), a disruptive technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrencies to smart contracts, is a potential solution to these challenges. We propose a BC-based architecture to protect the privacy of users and to increase the security of the vehicular ecosystem. Wireless remote software updates and other emerging services such as dynamic vehicle insurance fees are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed security architecture. We also qualitatively argue the resilience of the architecture against common security attacks.

AB We propose a localized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading model for locally buying and selling electricity among plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in smart grids. Unlike traditional schemes, which transport electricity over long distances and through complex electricity transportation meshes, our proposed model achieves demand response by providing incentives to discharging PHEVs to balance local electricity demand out of their own self-interests. However, since transaction security and privacy protection issues present serious challenges, we explore a promising consortium blockchain technology to improve transaction security without reliance on a trusted third party. A localized P2P Electricity Trading system with COnsortium blockchaiN (PETCON) method is proposed to illustrate detailed operations of localized P2P electricity trading. Moreover, the electricity pricing and the amount of traded electricity among PHEVs are solved by an iterative double auction mechanism to maximize social welfare in this electricity trading. Security analysis shows that our proposed PETCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real map of Texas indicate that the double auction mechanism can achieve social welfare maximization while protecting privacy of the PHEVs.

AB Driven by advances in data analytics, machine learning, and smart devices, financial technology is changing the way Canadians interact with the financial sector. The evolving landscape is further influenced by cryptocurrencies: non-fiat, decentralized digital payment systems, like Bitcoin, that operate outside the formal financial sector. While Bitcoin has garnered attention for facilitating criminal activity, including money laundering, terrorism financing, digital ransomware, weapons trafficking, and tax evasion, it is Bitcoin's underlying protocol, the blockchain, that represents an innovation capable of transforming financial services and challenging existing security, financial, and public safety regulations and policies. Canada's challenge is to find the right balance between oversight and innovation. Our paper examines these competing interests: we provide an overview of blockchain technologies, illustrate their potential in Canada and abroad, and examine the government's role in fostering innovation while concurrently bolstering regulations, maintaining public safety, and securing the integrity of financial systems.

TI Saving Deployment Costs of Smart Contracts by Eliminating Gas-wasteful
   Patterns

LA English
DT Article
DE Smart contract; Ethereum; Solidity; Gas; Cost; Pattern
AB Smart contracts are blockchain-based programs that have developed with the emergence of Ethereum, one of the most well-known blockchains. Gas, paid in Ethers (i.e., the cryptocurrency in Ethereum), is required for the costs to upload and run smart contracts on Ethereum. As cost-inefficiently designed smart contracts result in unnecessary costs, it is vital to eliminate any gas-wasteful code fragments to optimize the deployment costs. In this study, we define five gas-wasteful patterns: 'Over-public variables', 'Redundant initial values', 'Loose packing', 'Non-base unit types', and 'Non-constant variables', based on the state variables in Solidity, the most commonly used implementation language for smart contracts in Ethereum. We also propose improvement methods related to these patterns and a solution to identify and eliminate the patterns. Furthermore, we analyze 143 real-world contracts deployed on Ethereum and find that 56% of them include the above-mentioned patterns. We also upgrade 43 of the pattern-matched contracts and demonstrate that their deployment costs are decreased on an average by 13.47%, and the most-reduced rate is 64%.

AB Drawing on economic transaction cost theory, this paper explores how blockchain and distributed ledger technology could shift the smart city agenda by altering transaction costs with implications for the coordination of infrastructures and resources. Like the smart city the crypto city utilizes data informatics, but can be coordinated through distributed rather than centralized systems. The data infrastructure of the crypto city can enable civil society to run local public goods and services, and facilitate economic and social entrepreneurship.

DE Blockchain; Theory of value; Information economy; Backfeed
ID INFORMATIONAL CAPITALISM; RISE
AB This article explores the potential of blockchain technology in enabling a new system of value that will better support the dynamics of social sharing. Our study begins with a discussion of the evolution of value perceptions in the history of economic thought. Starting with a view on value as a coordination mechanism that defines meaningful action within a certain context, we associate the price system with the establishment of capitalism and the industrial economy. We then discuss its relevance to the information economy, exhibited as the techno-economic context of the sharing economy, and identify new modalities of value creation that better reflect the social relations of sharing. Through the illustrative case of Backfeed, a new system of value is envisioned, comprising three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; and (c) actualisation of value. In this framework, we discuss the solutions featured by Backfeed and describe a conceptual economic model of blockchain-based decentralised cooperation. We conclude with a tentative scenario for blockchain technology that can enable the creation of commons-oriented ecosystems in a sharing economy.

TI A proposal for UNCITRAL to develop a Model Law on Warehouse Receipts
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article fleshes out a proposal made during the fourth International Secured Transactions Colloquium, held in March 2017, for United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) to develop a model legal framework for warehouse receipts. It argues that most developing economies have sufficient warehousing infrastructure and secondary markets but lack a modern warehouse receipts law. To support this argument, it includes a summary of the recent projects funded by various agencies to promote the warehousing of goods and, in particular, agricultural commodities. It describes the recent efforts to create a model framework for warehouse receipts and provides guidance on the establishment of a warehouse receipts system by entities such as the Organization of American States, the World Bank Group, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Furthermore, the article analyses the work of UNCITRAL in the field of negotiable documents and concludes that such work has not addressed many aspects typically regulated by warehouse receipts laws. The analysis also focuses on the emerging practice of issuing electronic warehouse receipts, their trading through commodity exchanges, and the utilization of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, to dematerialize warehouse receipts. Finally, the article explores the most common modalities of warehousing services, the parties involved in warehouse receipts transactions, the characteristics of warehouse receipts in different jurisdictions, and the benefits of electronic systems, identifying the areas that ought to be covered in a model warehouse receipts framework.

AB We report experimental results on relationship between polymer chain architecture and morphology of microdomains of asymmetric linear triblock copolymers, S1BS2 (S: polystyrene; B: polybutadiene). For this purpose, we synthesized various asymmetric triblock copolymers having different lengths of two end-blocks. The morphology was examined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although total molecular weight, composition, and thermal annealing temperature were kept constant, the morphology was found to change with a degree of chain asymmetry. One typical example exhibits a morphological change as cylinder lamella cylinder with a decrease in length of the shorter S-2 end-block chains, while keeping the total molecular weight and the total polystyrene composition constant. This curious morphological behavior exhibiting a re-entrant type change is qualitatively in accord with the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) results by Matsen [J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 113, 5539-5544]. This indicates that SCFT results about the morphological phase behavior of block copolymers are useful guides for experiments as long as the preparation of block copolymer samples is precisely controlled. The re-entrant behavior predicted by SCFT for the asymmetric triblock copolymers is attributed to the pull-out of the shorter end-block chains from their preferred microdomain. Namely, when pull-out of the shorter S-2 end-block chains from a S-microdomain takes place, the shorter S-2 end-block chain is solubilized in B-microdomains. As a result, the effective polybutadiene composition is increased. This kind of mechanism, the solubilization of the shorter A(2) end-block chains, may be relevant to the re-entrant type change of morphology with the degree of the chain asymmetry, and it has been experimentally confirmed by the lowering of T-g of the middle blocks and the lowering of the chain mobility of the shorter M-2 end-blocks by the electron spin resonance using spin-labeled M1SM2 (M: poly(methyl acrylate), and the shorter M-2 end-block chains were spin-labeled) specimens. It is confirmed by this study that the architecture asymmetry is an important factor in addition to the composition and the degree of the segregation, impacting the morphological phase behavior of block copolymers.

Proponents imagine a future where commerce takes place exclusively using smart contracts, avoiding the high costs of contract drafting, judicial intervention, opportunistic behavior, and the inherent ambiguities of written language.
   These decentralized code-only contracts are part of a decades-long quest to eliminate supposed inefficiencies in traditional written agreements. Electronic data interchange (EDI), a contracting technology from the 1970s, was designed with the same goal and garnered similar fanfare. Commentators at the time imagined a revolution in the way firms transacted and a full shift away from anything resembling a paper contract. Ultimately EDI failed to achieve these goals-it empowered, rather than circumvented, human decisionmakers along with their "inefficient" way of forming agreements. In doing so, EDI successfully reduced some transaction costs while preserving efficient forms of contractual flexibility.
   Smart contracts are indeed more technologically sophisticated than EDI. Smart contract scripting languages offer a broader range of operations and greater scalability. Smart contracts are capable of seamlessly integrating with the operational and financial systems at the core of modern firms, whereas EDI transactions occurred in very early digital environments that required human intermediaries. Proponents of the smart contract revolution, therefore, do not describe the technology as a way to merely enhance human activity; they argue it can replace every stage of agreement formation and performance. From a purely technical standpoint, they might be right.
   However, shifting away from human-language contracts creates new inefficiencies. These stem from three features of smart contracts: automation, which requires that every agreement be formed from fully-defined terms; decentralization, which conditions performance on verification by third parties; and anonymity, which eliminates the use of commercial context to give meaning to agreement terms. As a result, it is extremely costly to form smart contracts in a volatile environment or whenever there's a level of uncertainty surrounding the agreement.
   On the other hand, semantic contracts are flexible. They enable parties to use performance standards, generally-defined contract terms, to create an enforceable agreement without requiring complete knowledge of what might happen in the future. Standards also allow parties to responsively incorporate commercial customs into their agreement, circumventing the need for explicit but redundant negotiation. And once their agreement is formed and executed, the parties are nonetheless free to dynamically shape their relationship through informal modifications or by selectively enforcing breaches. These two forms of flexibility-linguistic ambiguity, and enforcement discretion-create important efficiencies in the contracting process. By eliminating this flexibility, smart contracting will impose costs that are more severe and intractable than the ones it seeks to solve.

TI Intelligent Resource Management in Blockchain-Based Cloud Datacenters
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Nowadays, more and more companies migrate business from their own servers to the cloud. With the influx of computational requests, datacenters consume tremendous energy every day, attracting great attention in the energy efficiency dilemma. In this paper, we investigate the energy-aware resource management problem in cloud datacenters, where green energy with unpredictable capacity is considered. Via proposing a robust blockchain-based decentralized resource management framework, we save the energy consumed by the request scheduler. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method embedded in a smart contract to further minimize the energy cost. Because the reinforcement learning method is informed from the historical knowledge, it relies on no request arrival and energy supply. Experimental results on Google cluster traces and real-world electricity price show that our approach is able to reduce the datacenters' cost significantly compared with other benchmark algorithms.

TI The Governance of Blockchain Financial Networks
SO MODERN LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the emergence of the virtual currency Bitcoin in 2009, a new, Internet-based way of recording entitlements and enforcing rights has increasingly captured the interest of businesses and governments. The technology is commonly called blockchain' and is often associated with a closely related phenomenon, the smart contract'. The market is now exploring ways of using these concepts for financial assets, such as securities, fiat money and derivative contracts. This article develops a conceptual framework for the governance of blockchain-based networks in financial markets. It constructs a vision of how financial regulation and private law should set the boundaries of this new technology in order to protect market participants and societies at large, while at the same time allowing the necessary room for innovation.

TI Blockchain entrepreneurship opportunity in the practices of the unbanked
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Financial entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion; Blockchain; fsQCA;
   Informal finance; Fintech
AB Two billion people in developing economies have limited or no access to formal financial services, creating cause for substantial research interest in financial inclusion as a complex multidimensional phenomenon. Digital finance technologies, including blockchain, have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to financially excluded individuals. This article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded, which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach. After applying fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to determine the conditions related to financial practice and motivations that explain the absence of a formal bank account, I prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to consider when targeting this segment. The value of this article's approach extends well beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices. Blockchain entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial aspirations closer to people. My perspective is relevant to blockchain entrepreneurs who aim to understand the practices of the unbanked as source information for the development of innovative solutions.

DT Article
ID CIVIL RECOURSE; UNCONSCIONABILITY; PROMISES; CONSENT
AB Smart contracts are self-executing digital transactions using decentralized cryptographic mechanisms for enforcement. They were theorized more than twenty years ago, but the recent development of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies has rekindled excitement about their potential among technologists and industry. Startup companies and major enterprises alike are now developing smart contract solutions for an array of markets, purporting to offer a digital bypass around traditional contract law. For legal scholars, smart contracts pose a significant question: Do smart contracts offer a superior solution to the problems that contract law addresses? In this article, we aim to understand both the potential and the limitations of smart contracts. We conclude that smart contracts offer novel possibilities, may significantly alter the commercial world, and will demand new legal responses. But smart contracts will not displace contract law. Understanding why not brings into focus the essential role of contract law as a remedial institution. In this way, smart contracts actually illuminate the role of contract law more than they obviate it.

AB This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to-the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public private partnerships. Finally, riational governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.

AB This paper aims to identify the likely determinants for cryptocurrency value formation, including for that of bitcoin. Due to Bitcoin's growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance, it has become increasingly important to try to understand the factors that influence its value formation. Presently, the value of all bitcoins in existence represent approximately $7 billion, and more than $60 million of notional value changes hands each day. Having grown rapidly over the past few years, there is now a developing but vibrant marketplace for bitcoin, and a recognition of digital currencies as an emerging asset class. Not only is there a listed and over-the-counter market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, but also an emergent derivatives market. As such, the ability to value bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is becoming critical to its establishment as a legitimate financial asset.
   Using cross-sectional empirical data examining 66 of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, a regression model was estimated that points to three main drivers of cryptocurrency value: the level of competition in the network of producers, the rate of unit production, and the difficulty of algorithm used to "mine" for the cryptocurrency. These amount to relative differences in the cost of production of one digital currency over another at the margin, pointing to differences in relative cost of production electricity goes in, cryptocurrency comes out. Using that as a starting point, a no-arbitrage situation is established for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies followed by the formalization of a cost of production model to determine the fair value of a bitcoin.

TI Enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures for additive manufacturing:
   coupling lanthanide nanomaterial chemical signatures with blockchain
   technology
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
LA English

ID NANOCRYSTALS; SMARTPHONE; PHONE
AB The significant rise of additive manufacturing (AM) in recent years is in part due to the open sourced nature of the printing processes and reduced cost and capital barriers relative to traditional manufacturing. However, this democratization of manufacturing spurs an increased demand for producers and end-users to verify the authenticity and quality of individual parts. To this end, we introduce an anti-counterfeiting method composed of first embedding engineered nanomaterials into features of a 3D-printed part followed by non-destructive interrogation of these features to quantify a chemical signature profile. The part specific chemical signature data is then linked to a securitized, distributed, and time-stamped blockchain ledger entry. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, lanthanide-aspartic acid nanoscale coordination polymers (Ln(3+)-Asp NCs)/poly(lactic) acid (PLA) composites were formulated and transformed into a filament feedstock for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. In the present case, a quick-response (QR) code containing the doped Ln(3+)-Asp NCs was printed using a dual-extruder FDM printer into pure PLA parts. The QR code provides a searchable reference to an Ethereum-based blockchain entry. The QR code physical features also serve as defined areas to probe the signatures arising from the embedded Ln(3+)-Asp NCs. Visible fluorescence emission with UV-excitation was quantified in terms of color using a smartphone camera and incorporated into blockchain entries. Ultimately, linking unique chemical signature data to blockchain databases is anticipated to make the costs of counterfeiting AM materials significantly more prohibitive and transactions between those in the supply chain more trustworthy.

DE dlt; blockchain; distributed ledger; fintech; digital currency
AB This paper reviews what stage the central banks of the world's leading economies are at in their study and adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to reengineer their various systems and functions. A brief description of DLT will be given, followed by an analysis of central banks' publications and pronouncements to determine what each central bank is doing on their journey to DLT adoption. It was found that of the central banks for which information was available, all of them have expressed interest in DLT and have evaluated it to some extent. Nevertheless, no central bank has an operational DLT-based system at this point. This is because some issues remain regarding the speed, cost of processing, security, transparency and privacy, legal settlement finality, scalability and network effects of the technology. As DLT matures, the expectation is that these issues will begin to be resolved.

TI Govern by Blockchain Dubai wants one platform to rule them all, while

SO IEEE SPECTRUM
LA English
DT Article
AB GOVERNMENTS EVERYWHERE WOULD LIKE TO CUT RED tape, reduce bureaucracy, and speed the delivery of services. But constituents are still often frustrated by mounds of paperwork and the snail-like pace of official business. Could a blockchain help? Just as blockchains have shaken up the financial industry and changed our perception of money, some government agencies now believe the technology could rejuvenate the public sector. Proponents argue that its immutability will protect records from fraudsters, its transparency will keep employees accountable, and its ability to automatically process new entries can make agencies more efficient. Such promises have persuaded city, state, and federal governments to launch the first batch of public-sector blockchain experiments. Two of the most enthusiastic early adopters have been the U.S. state of Illinois and the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. And intriguingly enough, the two have adopted very different strategies for mixing blockchains into government.

TI Energy Trading for Fun and Profit Buy your neighbor's rooftop solar
   power or sell your own-it'll all be on a blockchain
SO IEEE SPECTRUM
LA English
DT Article
AB WOULD YOU PAY SLIGHTLY MORE for your electricity if you knew it was sourced from photovoltaic panels on your neighbor's roof? Or, if you are that neighbor, would you use your solar power to charge a battery and dump that energy back onto the grid at peak hours, when the price was highest? The answers to these questions-which depend on how people would behave in an open energy market-are unknown, because that market does not exist. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs, the two dominant schemes for reimbursing residential energy production, pay out at a fixed rate, effectively decoupling producers from the price signals that might otherwise direct their behavior. But that may be changing. And we may have the blockchain to thank. Multiple projects are now under way to use technology that was originally intended to account for transactions in digital currency to track electricity production and put it up for sale.

AB Stewart Macaulay and Ian Macneil were the prime movers in creating a model of contractual relations that went beyond the confines of the formal legal model that defined contract enforceability. The work of both of them has been influential even though it has suffered from many misdescriptions along the way. In this article I map their respective contributions and explain the differences between their visions of contract. I then add a third dimension: the possibilities for a new vision of contract and contractual relations raised by blockchain.

AB This article introduces the symposium Toward a Philosophy of Blockchain, which provides a philosophical contemplation of blockchain technology, the digital ledger software underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, for the secure transfer of money, assets, and information via the Internet without needing a third-party intermediary. The symposium offers philosophical scholarship on a new topic, blockchain technology, from a variety of perspectives. The philosophical themes discussed include mathematical models of reality, signification, and the sociopolitical institutions that structure human life and interaction. The symposium also investigates the metaphilosophical theme of how to create a philosophy of anything, specifically a new topic such as blockchain technology. Repeated themes are identified, in all areas of philosophical inquiry (ontology, epistemology, and axiology), and conceptual resources are elaborated to contribute to a philosophical understanding of blockchain technology. Thus, philosophy as a metaphilosophical approach is shown to be able to provide an understanding of the conceptual, theoretical, and foundational dimensions of novelty and emergence in the world, with a particular focus on blockchain technology.

ID DYNAMICS
AB The philosophy of blockchain technology is concerned, among other things, with blockchain ontology, how it might be characterised, how it is being created, implemented, and adopted, how it operates in the world, and how it evolves over time. This paper concentrates on whether Bitcoin/blockchain can be considered a complex system and, if so, whether it is a chaotic one. Beyond mere academic curiosity, a positive response would raise concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a 2010-Flash-Crash-type of chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for financial systems based on it. The paper starts by highlighting the relevant details of the Bitcoin/blockchain ecosystem formed by the blockchain itself, bitcoin end users (payers and payees), capital gains seekers, miners, full nodes maintainers, and developers, and their interactions. Then the Information Theory of Complex Systems is briefly discussed for later use. Finally, the blockchain is investigated with the help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure. The low non-null statistical complexity value obtained suggests that the blockchain may be considered algorithmically complicated but hardly a complex system and unlikely to enter a chaotic regime.

TI Blockchain Identities: Notational Technologies for Control and
   Management of Abstracted Entities

DT Article

AB This paper argues that many so-called digital technologies can be construed as notational technologies, explored through the example of Monegraph, an art and digital asset management platform built on top of the blockchain system originally developed for the cryptocurrency bitcoin. As the paper characterizes it, a notational technology is the performance of syntactic notation within a field of reference, a technologized version of what Nelson Goodman called a notational system. Notational technologies produce abstracted entities through positive and reliable, or constitutive, tests of socially acceptable meaning. Accordingly, this account deviates from typical narratives of blockchains (usually characterized as Turing or state machines), instead demonstrating that blockchain technologies are effective at managing digital assets because they produce abstracted identities through the performance of notation. Since notational technologies rely on configurations of socially acceptable meaning, this paper also provides a philosophical account of how blockchain technologies are socially embedded.

AB The central theme of this paper is that the development of a technology that is predicted to have a major impact on the way we transact with each other should be a matter where the needs of society at large are taken into account. Where the technology is one that emerges from the domain of the Internet, inclusivity becomes even more acute in order to avoid widening the already existing gap in reaping the digital dividend. With blockchain, the obligation could even be seen as a moral one, as blockchain is said to have the potential to negate the scope for the abuse of trust by states and institutions. This could be a game changer in areas such as public procurement and the conduct of elections where abuse can lead to the denial of essential resources and a concomitant loss of life, or to conflict and mass killings. Blockchain presents an opportunity for the Internet development community to claim a degree of recognition in the human rights realm by aiding civil intervention in areas where military intervention has been deemed inappropriate.

TI Blockchain Technology as an Institution of Property
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE blockchain; bitcoin; property; rights; institutions
AB This paper argues that the practical implementation of blockchain technology can be considered an institution of property similar to legal institutions. Invoking Penner's theory of property and Hegel's system of property rights, and using the example of bitcoin, it is possible to demonstrate that blockchain effectively implements all necessary and sufficient criteria for property without reliance on legal means. Blockchains eliminate the need for a third-party authority to enforce exclusion rights, and provide a system of universal access to knowledge and discoverability about the property rights of all participants and how the system functions. The implications of these findings are that traditional property relations in society could be replaced by or supplemented with blockchain models, and implemented in new domains.

DE blockchain; DLT; identity; Russell's Paradox; sortal
AB This article studies the origin and continuity of the identity of the entities inscribed in a distributed ledger. Specifically, it focuses on the differences between the identities of the entities that exist in a distributed ledger and those of the entities that exist outside the ledger but must be represented in the ledger in order to interact with it. It suggests that a distributed ledger that contains representations of entities that exist outside the ledger can yield a continuum of interconnected existing and past identities that is constantly redefined to represent new conceptual entities. This continuum can be understood as a metasortalor a sortal of sortalsthat resembles the mathematical structure of a set of sets. Further, the article presents the dilemma that arises when representing the identities of entities in a distributed ledger, and it draws an analogy between this dilemma and Russell's Paradox.

AB A blockchain can be considered a technological phenomenon that is made up of different interconnected and autonomous systems. Such systems are referred to here as cyber-physical systems: complex interconnections of cyber and physical components. When cyber-physical systems are interconnected, a new whole consisting of a system of systems is created by the autonomous systems and their intercommunication and interaction. In a blockchain, individual systems can independently make decisions on joint information transactions. The decision-making procedures needed for this are executed based on fault-tolerant communication and voting and consensus procedures, while the results of these decision-making procedures are stored in distributed ledgers. Due to the intercommunication, interaction, and independent decision making by autonomous systems, the new whole of a blockchain is a complex entity. Complexity science rather than the usual reductionist scientific approach can help us better understand the behaviour of the new and continuously developing whole of a blockchain as a technological phenomenon.

ID CAPITALISM
AB This paper investigates ontological dimensions of the blockchain by asking what kind of socio-technical object bitcoin is. It discusses both blockchain's political qualities and the political forms enabled by its emergence. It first observes recent approaches to the ontology of money and the political qualities of the ledgers used by the current fractional reserve banking model. It then directs the same questions at blockchain technology. The paper discusses an ontology proposed by Ole Bjerg (2016) and argues in favour of a mixed-ontology approach to blockchains. It then questions the political qualities of the distributed ledger as a digital object and highlights the apparent absence of authority figures in the model. Finally, it argues that the political ontology of the blockchain can be framed as the displacement of authority from institutional actors into instrumental control of trust, in a dynamically distributed environment.

ID DARK SILICON; CRYPTOCURRENCY
AB Bitcoin is an electronic currency that has become increasingly popular since its introduction in 2008. Transactions in the bitcoin system are stored in a public transaction ledger ('the blockchain'), which is stored in a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Bitcoin provides decentralized currency issuance and transaction clearance. The security of the blockchain depends on a compute-intensive algorithm for bitcoin mining, which prevents double spending of bitcoins and tampering with confirmed transactions. This 'proof-of-work' algorithm is energy demanding. How much energy is actually consumed, is subject of debate. We argue that this energy consumption currently is in the range of 100-500 MW. We discuss the developments in bitcoin mining hardware. We also briefly outline alternative schemes that are less energy demanding. We finally look at other blockchain applications, and argue that also here energy consumption is not of primary concern.

AB This paper investigates alternative configurations of different blockchain architectures that can be used for gathering and processing transactions in a range of different settings, including accounting, auditing, supply chain and other types of transaction information. Although there has been substantial focus on the peer-to-peer and public versions of blockchain, this paper focuses primarily on cloud-based and private configuration versions of blockchains and investigates use configurations, advantages and limitations as firms bring blockchain-based market mechanisms into their organizations. In addition, this paper investigates some emerging issues associated with blockchain use in consortium settings. Finally, this paper relates some proposed uses of blockchain for transaction processing to other technologies, such as data warehouses and databases.

AB Blockchain holds promise for being the revolutionary technology, which has the potential to find applications in numerous fields such as digital money, clearing, gambling and product tracing. However, blockchain faces its own problems and challenges. One key problem is to automatically cluster the behavior patterns of all the blockchain nodes into categories. In this paper, we introduce the problem of behavior pattern clustering in blockchain networks and propose a novel algorithm termed BPC for this problem. We evaluate a long list of potential sequence similarity measures, and select a distance that is suitable for the behavior pattern clustering problem. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm is much more effective than the existing methods in terms of clustering accuracy.

AB While the Internet is passing through a second era of development, companies and business environment are challenged by a disruptive technology: blockchain (BC), the platform underlying Bitcoin virtual currency. Considered a digital revolution, but in the same time a natural consequence of the Internet development, BC technology has deep implications for many companies. By now, BC-enabled projects crossed through multiple industries and services: banking, supply chain operations, real estate, insurance, healthcare, electronic health records, copyright, music, renewable energy, to name just a few. New BC-enabled projects are initiated mostly by leading IT and banking companies. The potential growth of the Internet of Things makes the BC technology come even closer and faster. In this paper we present the pros and cons for adopting BC technology and show some aspects of the current state in Romania.

AB In this general overview article intended for non-experts, I define blockchain technology and some of the key concepts, and then I elaborate four specific applications that highlight the potential economic benefits of digital ledgers. These applications are digital asset registries, blockchains as leapfrog technology for global financial inclusion, long-tail personalized economic services, and net settlement payment channels. I also highlight key challenges that offset the potential economic benefits of blockchain distributed ledgers, while arguing that the benefits would outweigh the potential risks. The overarching theme is that an increasing amount of everyday operations involving money, assets, and documents could start to be conducted via blockchain-based distributed network ledgers with cryptographic security, and at more granular levels of detail. One economic implication of widespread blockchain adoption is that the institutional structure of society could shift to one that is computationally-based and thus has a diminished need for human-operated brick-and-mortar institutions.

DE blockchain; legal; law; smart contracts; trust; reputation; online

AB Much of the discussion around blockchain-based smart contracts has focused on whether or not they operate in the same way as legal contracts. However, it is argued that most contracts are social rather than legal in nature and are entered into because the parties trust each other to perform the agreed exchange. Little has been written to address how the blockchain's trust protocol can enable the kind of social contracting that characterized the way exchanges were conducted before the Internet. This article aims to fill that gap by exploring blockchain-based smart contracts primarily as noncontractual social exchanges.

ID PATIENT-CENTERED CARE; ONLINE ACCESS; MICROBIOME; RECORDS
AB Health services must balance patient care with information privacy, access, and completeness. The massive scale of the healthcare industry also amplifies the importance of cost control. The promise of blockchain technology in health services, combined with application layers built atop it, is to be a mechanism that provides utmost privacy while ensuring that appropriate users can easily add to and access a permanent record of information. Blockchains, also called distributed ledgers, enable a combination of cost reduction and increased accessibility to information by connecting stake-holders directly without requirements for third-party brokers, potentially giving better results at lower costs. New ventures are looking to apply blockchain technology to solve real-world problems, including efforts to track public health, centralize research data, monitor and fulfill prescriptions, lower administrative overheads, and organize patient data from an increasing number of inputs. Here, concrete examples of the application of blockchain technology in the health sector are described, touching on near-term promise and challenges.

AB Blockchain-based solutions have the potential to make government operations more efficient and improve the delivery of services in the public and private sectors. Identity verification and authentication technologies, as one of the applications of blockchain-based solutions - and the focus of our own efforts at SecureKey Technologies - have been critical components in service delivery in both sectors due to their power to increase trust between citizens and the services they access. To convert trust into solid value added, identities must be validated through highly-reliable technologies, such as blockchain, that have the capacity to reduce cost and fraud and to simplify the experience for customers while also keeping out the bad actors. With identities migrating to digital platforms, organizations and citizens need to be able to transact with reduced friction even as more counter-bound services move to online delivery. In this article, drawing on our own experiences with an ecosystem approach to digital identity, we describe the potential value of using blockchain technology to address the present and future challenges of identity verification and authentication within a Canadian context.

AB Research background: The year 2016 ended the period of the migration from national payment services to the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA) instruments. At the same time, however, it has become apparent that some problems remained unresolved. Overcoming them requires finding suitable technological solutions. The potential of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) is currently being explored by the financial sector and its implementation may affect the SEPA schemes in a variety of dimensions.
   Purpose of the article: The aim of the article was to determine the potential impact that the DLT transfer to the banking sector may have on the functioning of the SEPA in the future. The paper presents SEPA's assumptions and the current status of the project as well as the DTL's concept. It describes the technology transfer implications for the banking industry and compares the SEPA schemes currently operating with those based on the DLT. It also indicates the opportunities and threats that are the consequence of the new technology implementation and examines their significance for the SEPA.
   Methods: In the article, a qualitative analysis is supplemented with a quantitative one. Elements of descriptive statistics have been used to characterize the functioning of the main pillars of the SEPA schemes. The final conclusions are based on the comparative analysis of the SEPA schemes and developed DLT applications.
   Findings & Value added: The existing problems might be solved by supplementing the SEPA payment schemes currently operating with the applications based on the DLT. The systems that will be subsequently developed will provide the required real-time processing and a global reach. They will also extend the functionalities of the SEPA schemes with the ability to transfer other currencies. The implementation of this technology will result not only in new financial products but, first of all, in creating new business models. Consequently, we may expect a modification of the currently operating SEPA schemes, based on their supplementation rather than total replacement in a short time frame.

AB Blockchain technology, which supports low-cost decentralized distributed data management featuring tamper resistance, high availability, and transparency, is a breakthrough technology that will lead to the next generation of information and communications technology (ICT). Originally devised to support the Bitcoin digital currency, it is expected to be applied to a broad range of financial applications as well as in various other sectors such as distribution and sharing economies. This broader application requires that several technical challenges including data privacy protection and better processing performance be addressed, and Fujitsu Laboratories is working on several relevant R&D projects. This paper introduces blockchain technology and example applications, describes a technology for achieving security in a business context, and examines Fujitsu's efforts in commercializing this technology and an accompanying service as well as the open source software (0SS) project.

DE peer review; BlockChain; currency
AB Peer review of scholarly papers is seen to be a critical step in the publication of high quality outputs in reputable journals. However, it appears that there are few incentives for researchers to agree to conduct suitable reviews in a timely fashion and in some cases unscrupulous practices are occurring as part of the production of academic research output. Innovations in internet-based technologies mean that there are ways in which some of the challenges can be addressed. In particular, this paper proposes a new currency system using the BlockChain as its basis that provides a number of solutions. Potential benefits and problems of using the technology are discussed in the paper and these will need further investigation should the idea develop further. Ultimately, the currency could be used as an alternative publication metric for authors, institutions and journals.

AB As the core of intelligent manufacturing, cyber-physical systems (CPS) have serious security issues, especially for the communication security of their terminal machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. In this paper, blockchain technology is introduced to address such a security problem of communications between different types of machines in the CPS. According to the principles of blockchain technology, we designed a blockchain for secure M2M communications. As a communication system, M2M consists of public network areas, device areas, and private areas, and we designed a sophisticated blockchain structure between the public area and private area. For validating our design, we took cotton spinning production as a case study to demonstrate our solution to M2M communication problems under the CPS framework. We have demonstrated that the blockchain technology can effectively solve the safety of expansion of machines in the production process and the communication data between the machines cannot be tampered with.

TI Research and Researchers: The Enduring Value of Conferences to Logistics

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS

DE logistics; supply chain; research; Internet of Things; Blockchain
ID EVOLUTION
AB Academic conferences serve the critical purposes of bringing together scholars to not only advance the state of the art in research, teaching, and practice, but also to socialize with established and prospective members of the academic society. In this way, conferences help to instill and reinforce the values of the academic society. Logistics and supply chain scholars are increasingly targeted to join in the dialogue of different academic networks and attend conferences in tangential disciplines. This editorial speaks to the growing affinity for logistics and supply chain scholars in different disciplinary settings, yet underscores the CSCMP Annual Global Conference (AGC) and its Academic Research Symposium (ARS) as the premier forums for advancing the state of the art in supply chain scholarship and reinforcing the discipline's traditions and values.

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB The constant rise of over-the-top video consumption nowadays challenges the current Internet architecture. In this article, we propose a user-centric approach that helps the necessary reshaping of the content delivery ecosystem. We study how blockchain-powered smart contracts and network service chaining can be exploited to support such novel collaboration schemes. Finally, our findings suggest that the proposed solution can complement existing technologies by supporting a wide range of business cases while at the same time significantly reducing costs.

AB The financial technology (FinTech) sector sees high potential value in cryptocurrency blockchain protocols, or distributed-ledger technology (DLT). However, the requirements and guarantees of blockchains for cryptocurrencies do not match those of FinTech-from transaction throughput to security primitives and privacy. The author explores how blockchain research beyond Bitcoin is closing these gaps and some of the challenges that remain.

AB Blockchain technology, while still challenged with key limitations, is a transformative Information and Communications Technology (ICT) that has changed our notion of trust. Improved efficiencies for agricultural sustainable development has been demonstrated when ICT-enabled farms have access to knowledge banks and other digital resources. UN FAO-recommended ICT e-agricultural infrastructure components are a confluence of ICT and blockchain technology requirements. When ICT e-agricultural systems with blockchain infrastructure are immutable and distributed ledger systems for record management, baseline agricultural environmental data integrity is safeguarded for those who participate in transparent data management. This paper reviewed blockchain-based concepts associated with ICT-based technology. Moreover, a model ICT e-agriculture system with a blockchain infrastructure is proposed for use at the local and regional scale. To determine context specific technical and social requirements of blockchain technology for ICT e-agriculture systems, an evaluation tool is presented. The proposed system and tool can be evaluated and applied to further developments of e-agriculture systems.

AB This paper looks at the challenges and opportunities of implementing blockchain technology across banking, providing food for thought about the potentialities of this disruptive technology. The blockchain technology can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achieving sustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present. In fact, many banks are currently focusing on blockchain technology to promote economic growth and accelerate the development of green technologies. In order to understand the potential of blockchain technology to support the financial system, we studied the actual performance of the Bitcoin system, also highlighting its major limitations, such as the significant energy consumption due to the high computing power required, and the high cost of hardware. We estimated the electrical power and the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, over time, and, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Bitcoin system in its actual operation, we defined three quantities: "economic efficiency", "operational efficiency", and "efficient service". The obtained results show that by overcoming the disadvantages of the Bitcoin system, and therefore of blockchain technology, we could be able to handle financial processes in a more efficient way than under the current system.

ID GOVERNANCE
AB Blockchain refers to a range of general purpose technologies to exchange information and transact digital assets in distributed networks. The core question addressed in this paper is whether blockchain technology will lead to innovation and transformation of governmental processes. To address this question we present a critical assessment of the often exaggerated benefits of blockchain technology found in the literature and discuss their implications for governmental organizations and processes. We plea for a shift from a technology-driven to need driven approach in which blockchain applications are customized to ensure a fit with requirements of administrative processes and in which the administrative processes are changed to benefit from the technology. Having sound governance models are found to be a condition for realizing benefits. Based on a critical assessment we offer directions for further research into the potential benefits of BC applications in e-government and the role of governance of BC architectures and applications to comply with societal needs and public values.

TI DistBlockNet: A Distributed Blockchains-Based Secure SDN Architecture
   for IoT Networks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid increase in the number and diversity of smart devices connected to the Internet has raised the issues of flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability within the current IoT network. These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.

AB The technology underpinning Bitcoin-the blockchain-is acknowledged to offer security, stability and efficiency to online transactions. After a brief introduction to Bitcoin system, I touch upon the most innovative implementation of blockchain technology: the so-called smart contracts, ie programmable computer protocols that are able to self-enforce the terms therein encoded upon certain triggering conditions. First, I sketch their core functioning and benefits for digital relationships. Secondly, I stress their structural constraints and the issues of regulability fully decentralized blockchains pose. The elements underlined highlight the reasons why the financial and banking sectors represent smart contracts most immediate testing ground.

DE financial accounting; blockchain; ledger; database
AB The blockchain has enabled the successful creation of decentralized digital currency networks. This success has prompted further investigation into the usefulness of blockchains in other business settings. Because of the blockchain's use as a ledger, the question arises whether the blockchain could become a more secure alternative to current accounting ledgers. We show that this is infeasible. By casting this question in the context of the Byzantine Generals Problem, which the blockchain was designed to solve, we identify multiple flaws hindering implementation of the blockchain as a financial reporting tool. Whereas blockchain-based digital currencies only exist within the blockchain, economic transactions exist outside of accounting records. This distinction prevents an acceptable level of transaction verification using the blockchain model. Additionally, the security benefits of the blockchain that render it ostensibly immutable are not fully available or reliable in an accounting setting.

AB Since 2009, blockchain has served as a potentially transformative information technology expected to be as revolutionary as the Internet. Originally developed as a methodology to record cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain's functionality has evolved into a large number of applications, such as banking, financial markets, insurance, voting systems, leasing contracts, and government service. Despite such advancements, the application of blockchain to accounting and assurance remains under-explored. This paper aims to provide an initial discussion on how blockchain could enable a real-time, verifiable, and transparent accounting ecosystem. Additionally, blockchain has the potential to transform current auditing practices, resulting in a more precise and timely automatic assurance system.

AB Blockchain technology provides an exciting application space for innovation in diverse domains but threatens disintermediation for organizations providing a trusted and auditable account of ownership and transactions. It needs, however, an appropriate regulation to keep pace with technological developments. Technology remains very young, akin to the Internet in the early 1990s. Use cases, practical demonstrators, standards, and lexical consistency are urgently required.

AB The blockchain innovation appears to represent viable catalysts for achieving global sustainable development targets. Projects and initiatives seeking to extend the reach of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) seem mostly intended for the benefit of for-profit businesses, governments, and consumers. DLT projects devised for the public good could aim, in theory, to fulfill the United Nation's current sustainable development goals. Blockchain technology is being applied in ways that could transform this ambition for good into a practical reality.

AB Blockchain has the potential to become a significant source of disruptive innovations in business and management. There is a scarcity of knowledge and understanding of blockchain techniques that hinders its academic research and practical application. Business managers need to understand the potential impact and threat of blockchain applications in order to gain and maintain competitive advantage. Blockchain applications appear to offer considerable performance improvement and commercialization opportunities.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITY; PIRACY
AB Visibility of digital art and its ownership can be achieved using blockchain technology as part of a broader solution for the identification, attribution, and payment for digital work. A case study is provided of a firm using the Bitcoin blockchain as part of an integrated solution to identify and authenticate ownership of digital property. An integrated ownership ledger allows for secure attribution, transfer, and provenance of digital property. Blockchain technology enables limited-edition digital property, while Internet-scale web crawl and machine learning shows where and how works are being used on the Internet.

AB Blockchain technology may have transformational potential for those music industries associated with recorded music, and for the sustainability of music careers. While predictions of widespread disintermediation may have been premature, blockchain technology does appear to have the potential to transform the role of third parties and to make musicians' careers more sustainable. Blockchains could improve the accuracy and availability of copyright data, facilitate near-instant micropayments for royalties, and significantly improve the transparency of the value chain.

AB Blockchain technology is considered, in some quarters, to have outgrown its primary association with the Bitcoin payments ecosystem. This belief has fostered numerous predictions of blockchain futures, in which the Bitcoin ecosystem is largely absent. It is nevertheless wholly possible to imagine a future for blockchain in which Bitcoin plays a presiding role. In drawing attention to subtexts of this kind, expectations of the future can prove highly persuasive within the context of technology selection and adoption processes of the present, lending an invisible hand to the design of business models, while also guiding strategic choices and the purchasing decisions made by managers.

DT Article
AB Blockchain as an engine for auto-enforceable smart contracts could disrupt traditional governance structures by reducing bureaucracy through lower transaction costs, solving principal-agent issues, and subsequent moral hazard. While machine consensus can radically reduce transaction costs and disrupt traditional governance structures, there is a gap between initial conceptualizations of blockchains and their first instantiations. First use cases show that as circumstances change, protocols can become inappropriate for the new environment and require modification. Modification of blockchain code happens through majority consensus, but reaching consensus in a distributed multi-stakeholder network with sometimes unaligned interests is complex, potentially introducing new agency issues.

AB Blockchain technologies are reconfiguring the global economy, though often in contradictory ways. Blockchain technologies are disrupting key economic and financial sectors. Some blockchain applications allow for democratization of finance, services, agriculture, and governance, yet they may also deepen inequality and weaken democracy. We need new understandings of the countervailing tendencies of blockchain technologies and the contingencies that shape their deployment.

AB The impact of diurnal photosynthetic activity on the fine structure of the amylopectin fraction of starch synthesized by normal barley (NBS) and waxy barley (WBS), the latter completely devoid of amylose biosynthesis, was determined following the cultivation under normal diurnal or constant light growing conditions. The amylopectin fine structures were analysed by characterizing its unit chain length profiles after enzymatic debranching as well as its phi,beta-limit dextrins and its clusters and building blocks after their partial and complete hydrolysis with alpha-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, respectively. Regardless of lighting conditions, no structural effects were found when comparing both the amylopectin sides chain distribution and the internal chain fragments of these amylopectins. However, the diurnally grown NBS and WBS both showed larger amylopectin clusters and these had lower branching density and longer average chain lengths than clusters derived from plants grown under constant light conditions. Amylopectin clusters from diurnally grown plants also consisted of a greater number of building blocks, and shorter inter-block chain lengths compared to clusters derived from plants grown under constant light. Our data demonstrate that the diurnal light regime influences the fine structure of the amylopectin component both in amylose and non-amylose starch granules. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A blockchain is an underlying technology and basic infrastructure of the Bitcoin system. At present, blockchains and their applications are developing rapidly. However, the basic research of blockchain technology is still in the early stages. The efficiency and reliability of blockchain communication is one of the research problems that urgently need to be studied and addressed. Existing algorithms may be less feasible for blockchain-based communication because they only consider a single communication factor (node communication capability or node trust degree) and only focus on a single communication performance parameter(communication time or communication reliability). In this paper, to shorten the validation time of blockchain transactions and improve the reliability of blockchain-based communication, we first establish a multi-link concurrent communication model based on trust degree, and then we propose a novel integrated factor communication tree algorithm (IFT). This algorithm comprehensively considers the node communication link number and the node trust degree and selects several nodes with powerful communication capacity and high trust as the communication sources to improve the concurrency and communication efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the IFT algorithm outperforms existing algorithms. A blockchain communication routing scheme based on the IFT algorithm can increase communication efficiency by ensuring communication reliability.

AB In December 2014, Estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to apply to become an e-Resident. Estonian e-Residency is essentially a commercial initiative. The e-ID issued to Estonian e-Residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors. It does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense, and the e-ID provided to e-Residents is not a travel document. However, in many ways it is an international 'passport' to the virtual world. E-Residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the Estonian government is now partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-Residents based on blockchain technology is of significance. The application of blockchain to e-Residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated. This paper examines the legal, policy, and technical implications of this development. (C) 2017 Clare Sullivan & Eric Burger. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Capm; Business cycles; Pareto optimality

AB In this paper we show in a thought experiment that in an economy where i) investors hold rational expectations, ii) output is generated by a linear homogeneous production function, and iii) real investment is allocated across sectors according to the CAPM, a fractional reserve banking system is not Pareto efficient and amplifies the business cycle. In developing these results we show that these three well known propositions in economics also imply a new view of the business cycle, one where the business cycle is described in terms of the dispersion of an ex-ante probability distribution. The policy implication of this analysis is that bank regulation should go further than the Volcker rule or the Vickers commission proposal by restricting bank investments to currency and deposit accounts on the central bank. Non bank financial institutions should then carry out the financial intermediation function now carried out by banks. The paper proposes that post office banking perhaps augmented with blockchain technology sometime in the future is one way to implement the transition from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking. While little academic work has been done on full reserve banking in the aftermath of the Great Crisis, it is interesting to note that it is part of banking reform proposals now (July 2016) before the parliament in Iceland and a special national referendum in Switzerland.

AB Blockchain has drawn attention as the next-generation financial technology due to its security that suits the informatization era. In particular, it provides security through the authentication of peers that share virtual cash, encryption, and the generation of hash value. According to the global financial industry, the market for security-based blockchain technology is expected to grow to about USD 20 billion by 2020. In addition, blockchain can be applied beyond the Internet of Things (IoT) environment; its applications are expected to expand. Cloud computing has been dramatically adopted in all IT environments for its efficiency and availability. In this paper, we discuss the concept of blockchain technology and its hot research trends. In addition, we will study how to adapt blockchain security to cloud computing and its secure solutions in detail.

TI Traveling waves in a spring-block chain sliding down a slope
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article

AB Traveling waves are studied in a spring slider-block model. We explicitly construct front waves (kinks) for a piecewise-linear spinodal friction force. Pulse waves are obtained as the matching of two traveling fronts with identical speeds. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wavespeed and the wave form in the anticontinuum limit. The link with localized waves in a Burridge-Knopoff model of an earthquake fault is briefly discussed.

AB Reproducibility, data sharing, personal data privacy concerns and patient enrolment in clinical trials are huge medical challenges for contemporary clinical research. A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community. Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure "trustless" manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders. In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.

AB Background: Digital health technologies, including telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and remote monitoring, are playing a greater role in medical practice. Safe and accurate management of medical information leads to the advancement of digital health, which in turn results in a number of beneficial effects. Furthermore, mHealth can help lower costs by facilitating the delivery of care and connecting people to their health care providers. Mobile apps help empower patients and health care providers to proactively address medical conditions through near real-time monitoring and treatment, regardless of the location of the patient or the health care provider. Additionally, mHealth data are stored in servers, and consequently, data management that prevents all forms of manipulation is crucial for both medical practice and clinical trials.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a tamper-resistant mHealth system using blockchain technology, which enables trusted and auditable computing using a decentralized network.
   Methods: We developed an mHealth system for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using a smartphone app. The volunteer data collected with the app were stored in JavaScript Object Notation format and sent to the blockchain network. Thereafter, we evaluated the tamper resistance of the data against the inconsistencies caused by artificial faults.
   Results: Electronic medical records collected using smartphones were successfully sent to a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. We verified the data update process under conditions where all the validating peers were running normally. The mHealth data were successfully updated under network faults. We further ensured that any electronic health record registered to the blockchain network was resistant to tampering and revision. The mHealth data update was compatible with tamper resistance in the blockchain network.
   Conclusions: Blockchain serves as a tamperproof system for mHealth. Combining mHealth with blockchain technology may provide a novel solution that enables both accessibility and data transparency without a third party such as a contract research organization.

SO ERCIM NEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB We propose a way for users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can then be validated against a record on Bitcoin's blockchain. We obtain anonymity for users by making use of a scheme of Brands to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of identity and also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting users control a secret of their own. This way, users can gain access to services thanks to the identity records of our proposal.

AB Until recently, digitalisation in the public sector was characterised largely by making existing processes faster or more efficient. Blockchain instead is challenging established public structures. Currently publically controlled functions for interaction could be organised completely privately, which requires a repositioning of the state. At the same time, Blockchain provides a technological approach that can be used by the public sector itself to improve transparency and trust.

TI Blockchain-enabled Intelligent Asset Exchange for a Circular Economy
SO ERCIM NEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB As the notion of circular economy gains momentum, intelligent assets increasingly form the backbone of sustainable ecosystems. Although these assets can supply the necessary knowledge for fueling the value drivers of a circular economy, the generated value will be significantly amplified by allowing third parties to manage them and profit from better asset utilisation. However, for an everchanging networked environment consisting of numerous assets, ownership needs to be dynamic, granular and adaptable in order to maximise gains. Blockchain-based mechanisms can effectively serve this need by enabling transfer of asset ownership directly between parties participating in the circular economy while introducing trust, efficiency and automation in asset exchange contracts.

AB The ability to use identities in many different digital contexts is vital for doing electronic business transactions. Such identities are hard to come by, in particular when the transaction involves international parties that do not necessarily trust each other (yet). The Dutch Techruption project has taken on the challenge of specifying a self-sovereign identity framework (SSIF) that aims to solve this problem, and to build demonstrators that show its practical use, for businesses, consumers and governments. Blockchain technologies are used for critical parts, such as storing commitments to attestations and revocation events.

The underlying idea is to properly represent the access rights of the subjects in the blockchain in order to easily allow their enforcement at access request time. By leveraging blockchain advantages we can add new desired properties, such as auditability, to the access control system. To prove the feasibility and validate the proposed approach we developed a proof of concept implementation and performed some relevant experiments.

AB The electricity sector is in a transition towards a Smart Energy System where the roles of private and institutional actors are evolving. This work deals with the influence of some technological innovations, enabling social innovations such as peer to peer trading and the participation in local energy collectives, on the regulation of the rights and obligations of consumers and prosumers in the electricity sector. It identifies the main radical innovations in the electricity market and analyses the legal and related non-legal obstacles that may impede the empowerment of energy consumers and prosumers. Some recommendations are provided to ensure that consumers and prosumers are empowered and can benefit from these new technological and social innovations in the electricity market. The recommendations relate to an accurate definition of prosumers and active consumers, the integration of demand response, the evolving role of distribution network operators and the birth of peer-to-peer trading.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is now destroying the barriers between the real and digital worlds. However, one of the huge problems that can slow down the development of this global wave, or even stop it, concerns security and privacy requirements. The criticality of these latter comes especially from the fact that the smart objects may contain very intimate information or even may be responsible for protecting people's lives. In this paper, the focus is on access control in the IoT context by proposing a dynamic and fully distributed security policy. Our proposal will be based, on one hand, on the concept of the blockchain to ensure the distributed aspect strongly recommended in the IoT; and on the other hand on machine learning algorithms, particularly on reinforcement learning category, in order to provide a dynamic, optimized and self-adjusted security policy.

AB An analysis of some of the recent blockchain networks is presented to determine if they satisfy Metcalfe's Law, as has been shown for some online social media networks. The value of the network was modeled based on the price of the digital currency in use on the network, and the number of users by the number of unique addresses each day that engage in transactions on the network. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash networks were analyzed. The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe's Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users. A new network model was also presented that shows the value to be proportional to the exponential of the root of the number of users participating in the network, and shows good agreement as well. Conditions for determining critical mass based on the new model were also presented. Finally, the potential for identifying value bubbles that can be spotted as deviations in value from the model was discussed and illustrated using the data from one of the networks. Those value bubbles show up where repeated extremely high value increases are not accompanied by any commensurate increase in the number of participating users, or any other development that could give rise to the higher value.

TI Blockchain Ensures Transparency in Personal data Usage: Being Ready for

SO ERCIM NEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1][L1], which will come into effect in 2018, demands transparency as one of the main principles for the collection, processing, storing and transfer of personal data. Transparency ensures that individuals can enforce their legal rights: to withdraw consent for their personal data to be processed or to request that their data are erased. At the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology we filed a patent, based on blockchain technology, that guarantees transparency in the context of files that are exchanged in a shared data pool. It guarantees that access by partners to specific files can be traced without a central entity.

AB The advances in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) brought many benefits to the healthcare area, specially to digital storage of patients' health records. However, it is still a challenge to have a unified viewpoint of patients' health history, because typically health data is scattered among different health organizations. Furthermore, there are several standards for these records, some of them open and others proprietary. Usually health records are stored in databases within health organizations and rarely have external access. This situation applies mainly to cases where patients' data are maintained by healthcare providers, known as EHRs (Electronic Health Records). In case of PHRs (Personal Health Records), in which patients by definition can manage their health records, they usually have no control over their data stored in healthcare providers' databases. Thereby, we envision two main challenges regarding PHR context: first, how patients could have a unified view of their scattered health records, and second, how healthcare providers can access up-to-date data regarding their patients, even though changes occurred elsewhere. For addressing these issues, this work proposes a model named OmniPHR, a distributed model to integrate PHRs, for patients and healthcare providers use. The scientific contribution is to propose an architecture model to support a distributed PHR, where patients can maintain their health history in an unified viewpoint, from any device anywhere. Likewise, for healthcare providers, the possibility of having their patients data interconnected among health organizations. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the model in maintaining health records distributed in an architecture model that promotes a unified view of PHR with elasticity and scalability of the solution.

AB Nowadays, the development of traditional business models become more and more mature that people use them to guide various kinds of E-business activities. Internet of things (IoT), being an innovative revolution over the Internet, becomes a new platform for E-business. However, old business models could hardly fit for the E-business on the IoT. In this article, we 1) propose an IoT E-business model, which is specially designed for the IoT E-business; 2) redesign many elements in traditional E-business models; 3) realize the transaction of smart property and paid data on the IoT with the help of P2P trade based on the Blockchain and smart contract. We also experiment our design and make a comprehensive discuss.

AB The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to the 4th Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) and to present an example where blockchain is employed to facilitate machine to-machine (M2M) interactions and establish a M2M electricity market in the context of the chemical industry. The presented scenario includes two electricity producers and one electricity consumer trading with each other over a blockchain. All participants are supplied with realistic data produced by process flow sheet models. This work contributes a proof-of-concept implementation of the scenario. Additionally, this paper describes and discusses the research and application landscape of blockchain technology in relation to the Industry 4.0. It concludes that this technology has significant under researched potential to support and enhance the efficiency gains of the revolution and identifies areas for future research.

ID GENERATION; CHINA; PV
AB The emergence of citizen-based power systems in an integrated grid has been anticipated for decades. We can reveal how this is emerging in practice due to the significant uptake of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) and now battery storage in Perth, Australia. The high cost of electricity, high radiant energy levels and easy access to cheap Chinese technology, has led to dramatic buying during Perth's recent boomtown years. The traditional uni-directional power system is rapidly disrupting and this paper assesses where this may lead and what it means for the grid. Results of detailed monitoring in a solar powered house along with the impact of a battery storage system show the impact on the traditional grid is substantial but it will still be needed and must therefore adapt to the new distributed, bi-directional energy system. Surveys and price trajectories reveal how the trends to solar power storage will continue and how a citizen utility paradigm will emerge as the future grid building block using new blockchain support systems. Responses from utilities are then see to be fight, flight or innovate.

ID PRIVACY; MODEL
AB Disseminating medical data beyond the protected cloud of institutions poses severe risks to patients' privacy, as breaches push them to the point where they abstain from full disclosure of their condition. This situation negatively impacts the patient, scientific research, and all stakeholders. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing framework that sufficiently addresses the access control challenges associated with sensitive data stored in the cloud using immutability and built-in autonomy properties of the blockchain. Our system is based on a permissioned blockchain which allows access to only invited, and hence verified users. As a result of this design, further accountability is guaranteed as all users are already known and a log of their actions is kept by the blockchain. The system permits users to request data from the shared pool after their identities and cryptographic keys are verified. The evidence from the system evaluation shows that our scheme is lightweight, scalable, and efficient.

AB We analyze statistical properties of the largest cryptocurrencies (determined by market capitalization), of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. We characterize their exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar by fitting parametric distributions to them. It is shown that returns are clearly non-normal, however, no single distribution fits well jointly to all the cryptocurrencies analysed. We find that for the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best fit, while for the smaller cryptocurrencies the normal inverse Gaussian distribution, generalized t distribution, and Laplace distribution give good fits. The results are important for investment and risk management purposes.

AB Densely sulfonated poly(fluorenyl ether sulfone) block copolymers (DS-PFESs) of various hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligomer block lengths were prepared, and the effect of the block length on the membranes' physicochemical and electrical properties was systematically investigated. Although the conductivity increased with the block length, a morphological analysis identified an optimal chain length. Further increases in the chain length resulted in the formation of larger ionic cluster clumps that caused a significant loss in the phase separation and, hence the dimensional/mechanical stability. The DS-9-32 membrane, prepared with a hydrophilic and hydrophobic block length of 9:32, displayed a well-balanced hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase separation and a high conductivity, together with a high dimensional/mechanical stability.

AB Current construction engineering management suffers numerous challenges in terms of the trust, information sharing, and process automation. Blockchain which is a decentralised transaction and data management technology, has attracted increasing interests from both academic and industrial aspects since 2008. However, most of the existing research and practices are focused on the blockchain itself (i.e. technical challenges and limitations) or its applications in the finance service sector (i.e. Bitcoin). This paper aims to investigate the potential of applying blockchain technology in the construction sector. Three types of blockchain-enabled applications are proposed to improve the current processes of contract management, supply chain management, and equipment leasing, respectively. Challenges of blockchain implementation are also discussed in this paper.

AB We show how to realize two-factor authentication for a Bitcoin wallet. To do so, we explain how to employ an ECDSA adaption of the two-party signature protocol by MacKenzie and Reiter (Int J Inf Secur 2(3-4):218-239, 2004. doi:10.1007/s10207-004-0041-0 Address="10.1007/s10207-004-0041-0") in the context of Bitcoin and present a prototypic implementation of a Bitcoin wallet that offers both: two-factor authentication and verification over a separate channel. Since we use a smart phone as the second authentication factor, our solution can be used with hardware already available to most users and the user experience is quite similar to the existing online banking authentication methods.

AB Permissions usually cannot fulfill user requirements to determine security and privacy risks of Android smart phone applications. To provide users additional information about applications, this study proposes a blockchainbased reputation service for Android applications. The proposed reputation service provides a scheme to integrate reputation information about an application, such as comments, reviews, security analysis results and so on, around the world with tree structures. Therefore, people can send requests to perform query and update operations provided by the reputation service on the so called reputation information trees. Moreover, the proposed service adopts the blockchain technology used in the Bitcoin. Therefore, the service can be provided based on resources of application users and other volunteers. Consequently, we can prevent reputation information provided by the service from being controlled by a single party. Moreover, this study proposes a flexible means for application developers or marketplace providers to embed reputation information into applications to reduce the costs of obtaining the basic reputation information from the reputation service. Users can obtain reputation of applications from the application files directly and query advanced information from the reputation service on demand. While users can obtain more reputation information about applications, the study can hopefully contribute to enable users to understand application security and privacy risks.

AB Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have ignited intense discussions. Despite receiving extensive public attention, theoretical understanding is limited regarding the value of blockchain-based cryptocurrendes, as expressed in their exchange rates against traditional currencies. In this paper, we conduct a theory-driven empirical study of the Bitcoin exchange rate (against USD) determination, taking into consideration both technology and economic factors. To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a significant impact of mining technology and a decreasing significance of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Embedded devices are going to be used extremely in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The small and tiny IoT devices will operate and communicate each other without involvement of users, while their operations must be correct and protected against various attacks. In this paper, we focus on a secure firmware update issue, which is a fundamental security challenge for the embedded devices in an IoT environment. A new firmware update scheme that utilizes a blockchain technology is proposed to securely check a firmware version, validate the correctness of firmware, and download the latest firmware for the embedded devices. In the proposed scheme, an embedded device requests its firmware update to nodes in a blockchain network and gets a response to determine whether its firmware is up-to-date or not. If not latest, the embedded device downloads the latest firmware from a peer-to-peer firmware sharing network of the nodes. Even in the case that the version of the firmware is up-to-date, its integrity, i.e., correctness of firmware, is checked. The proposed scheme guarantees that the embedded device's firmware is up-to-date while not tampered. Attacks targeting known vulnerabilities on firmware of embedded devices are thus mitigated.

DE Bitcoin; blockchain; creative writing; digital publishing; narrative;

AB Digital technology is changing, and has changed the ways we create and consume narratives, from moving images and immersive storyworlds to digital long-form and multi-branched story experiences. At the same time, blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is revolutionizing the way that transactions and exchanges occur. As a globally stored and collaboratively written list of all transactions that have ever taken place within a given system, the blockchain decentralizes money and offers a platform for its creative use. There are already examples of blockchain technologies extending beyond the realm of currency, including the decentralization of domain name servers that are not subject to government takedown and identity management and governance. By framing key blockchain concepts with past and present storytelling practices, this article raises questions as to how the principles and implementation of such distributed ledger technologies might be used within contemporary writing practices - that is, can we imagine stories as a currency or value system? We present three experiments that draw on some of the fundamental principles of blockchain and Bitcoin, as an instantiation of a blockchain implemented application, namely, (1) the ledger, (2) the blocks and (3) the mining process. Each low-fi experiment was intentionally designed to be very accessible to take part in and understand and all were conducted as discrete workshops with different sets of participants. Participants included a cohort of design students, technology industry and design professionals and writing and interaction design academics. Each experiment raised a different set of reflections and subsequent questions on the nature of digital, the linearity (or not) of narratives and collaborative processes.

AB In recent decades, the ad hoc network for vehicles has been a core network technology to provide comfort and security to drivers in vehicle environments. However, emerging applications and services require major changes in underlying network models and computing that require new road network planning. Meanwhile, blockchain widely known as one of the disruptive technologies has emerged in recent years, is experiencing rapid development and has the potential to revolutionize intelligent transport systems. Blockchain can be used to build an intelligent, secure, distributed and autonomous transport system. It allows better utilization of the infrastructure and resources of intelligent transport systems, particularly effective for crowdsourcing technology. In this paper, we proposes a vehicle network architecture based on blockchain in the smart city (Block-VN). Block-VN is a reliable and secure architecture that operates in a distributed way to build the new distributed transport management system. We are considering a new network system of vehicles, Block-VN, above them. In addition, we examine how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular information. Finally, we discuss service scenarios and design principles for Block-VN.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as an alternative monetary system that could circumvent political and financial authorities. A practice in libertarian prefigurative politics, Bitcoin demonstrates the capacity for online subgroups to creatively appropriate internet-based technologies to enact alternative futures. Andrew Feenberg's critical theory of technology clarifies this capacity and outlines the significance of agency in technical action. As technology mediates many social relations, it has a significant role in the reproduction of social power. Technological agency is therefore a crucial site of resistance in which users can form alternative, democratic rationalizations of technology. Yet are such instances of agency intrinsically democratic? In analysing this aspect of Feenberg's theory, this article argues that Bitcoin represents a popular rationalization' of technology - a creative appropriation of technology that empowers some groups while lacking the ethical justification necessary to be considered democratic.

AB The authenticity of human resource information has become an important factor that affects the cost and efficiency of human resource management. With the rapid development of mobile devices and Internet technology, various human resource risks caused by information asymmetry constantly bring economic loss, and even a fatal blow, to enterprises. Based on Blockchain(BC), this paper aims to combine traditional encryption technology with Internet-distributed technology, to establish a human resource information management model that reduces the risk of authenticity of human resource information. This model aims to solve the lack of discrimination of the authenticity of human resource information, and to provide authentic and effective decision support information to the human resource management of an organization. The operation method, such as Bitcoin, is used to certify the human resource documentations, as well as to bind the information and the documentation. Furthermore, human resource information is recorded in an accounting book based on BC technology; thus, modifying and validating may be difficult in the entire net work. Consensus mechanism, smart contract, accounting, and payment functions of BC can provide the basic support for human resource information management. Moreover, decentralization of the protection mechanism can be achieved to achieve low cost and high efficiency of information transfer, and to ensure a high-performance work system in the human resource management of enterprises.

AB As data is having an increasingly relevant role in different business fields, ensuring integrity has become fundamental. Modern databases rely on transaction history written on redo logs to allow for data restore. However, if redo logs are (maliciously) forged, data can actually be lost or altered. Due its strong data integrity guarantees, blockchain technology can be employed to ensure log integrity, but its current performance limitations hinder actual exploitations.
   In previous work, we proposed a layered blockchain-based architecture for distributed (federated) database redo logs: a fast first layer blockchain, anchored to a secure second layer blockchain, based on proof-of-work to achieve strong integrity. Here, we present an implementation and an experimental evaluation of a prototype of that architecture, which employs a total consensus algorithm on the first layer blockchain. Finally, to improve availability and scalability, we refine our solution by investigating, respectively, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus and a Distributed Hash Table solution to shard the first layer blockchain ledger among available nodes.

AB In recent times food safety has drawn upsurge of academic and commercial concerns. In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale. The paper concludes with a description of a use case and the challenges to adopt blockchain technology in the future food supply chain traceability systems are discussed.

AB The rapid spread of the Internet in China is also changing people's consumption habits and lifestyle, small to food and entertainment, large to the defense industry, the Internet has been integrated into every corner of China's economic industry. With the Internet consumption of consumer spending and the promotion of consumer ideas, China's Internet consumer financial market came into being and achieved rapid development. There is a unique advantage in Internet consumer finance in a large number of individual customers in the consumption habits, spending power and other aspects of the information, breaking the information monopoly of the traditional consumer finance institutions. Therefore, in the market most of the Internet companies, including Jingdong, Baidu and so began to lay a large-scale Internet banking business. In the process of large-scale development of capital and credit business on the Internet financial platform, they need for a large amount of funds. The traditional financing model has been unable to meet the needs of the rapid expansion of the industry, so following the traditional equity and debt financing, asset securitization opens up an innovative way of financing channels to solve the problem of financing platform to bring a new way of thinking. However, in the process of asset securitization, there are many problems in the bottom of the asset management process, and block chain technology in the process of application, just to help consumer financial services companies to achieve asset fidelity, reduce financing costs. And in asset management, you can ensure the authenticity of the underlying asset quality.
   In this paper, taking Jingdong as an example, this paper first introduces the concept of Accounts Receivable Backed Securitization(ARBS) of JD.com Consumer Credit Line, and the specific transaction process. Second, the introduction of the entire ABS cloud platform and the significance of the analysis. The last part introduces the block chain technology applied in the asset securitization of JD, mainly include the basic principles of block chain technology, the necessity of application in ABS and the application prospect in future financial industry.

AB Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.

DE Blockchain; Byzantine Fault Tolerance; Consensus Protocol; Quorum Slice
AB Blockchain is a distributed, transparent, immutable ledger. Consensus protocol forms the core of blockchain. They decide how a blockchain works. With the advent of new possibilities in blockchain technology, researchers are keen to find a well-optimized Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol. Creating a global consensus protocol or tailoring a cross-platform plug and play software application for implementation of various consensus protocols are ideas of huge interest. Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is considered to be a global consensus protocol and promises to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) by bringing with it the concept of quorum slices and federated byzantine fault tolerance. This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here. This paper focuses on analyzing these consensus protocols already proposed and their feasibility and efficiency in meeting the characteristics they propose to provide.

DE Block chain; Internet finance; Application; Governance mechanism
AB Great concerns have arisen due to the increasing research of block chain application in internet finance. However, there appears to have many research prospects in this area according to China's present development situation. In most studies of research, block chain technology is in the theoretical stage, practice still needed. At home and abroad, block chain technology has been gradually put into use, but there are no complete landing application results. From the development point of view, the future of technology conversion still takes a long time of practice. This paper is intended to analyze the development of block chain in internet finance in order to illustrate its future's development prospect. The greatest emphasis has been on the influence of block chain application in internet finance. The methods used in this study are known as comparison method and graphic method. Studies have shown that block chain will reconstruct internet financial governance mechanism and block chain technology is a useful tool for internet shared finance. The findings of the research have led to the conclusion that the road of block chain application in internet finance in china and abroad is still long and implications in this area still needs being pushed on. Suggestions were made for further study of block chain in internet finance.

AB Supply Chain Management systems provide information sharing and analysis to companies and support their planning activities. They are not based on the real data because there is asymmetric information between companies, then leading to disturbance of the planning algorithms. On the other hand, sharing data between manufacturers, suppliers and customers becomes very important to ensure reactivity towards markets variability. Especially, double marginalization is a widespread and serious problem in supply chain management. Decentralized systems under wholesale price contracts are investigated, with double marginalization effects shown to lead to supply insufficiencies, in the cases of both deterministic and random demands. This paper proposes a blockchain based solution to address the problems of supply chain such as Double Marginalization and Information Asymmetry etc.

AB Enabled by mobile and wearable technology, personal health data delivers immense and increasing value for healthcare, benefiting both care providers and medical research. The secure and convenient sharing of personal health data is crucial to the improvement of the interaction and collaboration of the healthcare industry. Faced with the potential privacy issues and vulnerabilities existing in current personal health data storage and sharing systems, as well as the concept of self-sovereign data ownership, we propose an innovative user-centric health data sharing solution by utilizing a decentralized and permissioned blockchain to protect privacy using channel formation scheme and enhance the identity management using the membership service supported by the blockchain. A mobile application is deployed to collect health data from personal wearable devices, manual input, and medical devices, and synchronize data to the cloud for data sharing with healthcare providers and health insurance companies. To preserve the integrity of health data, within each record, a proof of integrity and validation is permanently retrievable from cloud database and is anchored to the blockchain network. Moreover, for scalable and performance considerations, we adopt a tree-based data processing and batching method to handle large data sets of personal health data collected and uploaded by the mobile platform.

AB Economy of knowledge is built on the ground of intellectual production. The efficiency of knowledge economy relies on the intellectual assets' market and regulation that requires smart solutions providing information security of the data processing. The blockchain' technology as a secure tool is already wide-spread within the individual contracting in the finance, management and governance. The Russian government discusses the possibilities to introduce this basic tool into public administration to assure the data safety, especially, to the creation and management of the State Registers, the Russian Association for Financial Technologies (FinTech Association) is established to help the digitalization process in the country. The FinTech Association produced the White Paper for Masterchain as a public resource for smart contracts can be used as an efficient tool not only for financial transactions or real estate register, but especially as a tool of the fast and secure processing of intellectual assets and exchange of ideas, providing high level of confidence for the knowledge' transfer. The paper includes the theoretical exploration of digital economy concept with the new tools of cloud and fog computing, Masterchain and crypto-currencies, the regulation of knowledge within the new context.

AB This paper describes the design and development of a decentralized firewall system powered by a novel malware detection engine. The firewall is built using blockchain technology. The detection engine aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as malicious or benign. File classification is carried out using a deep belief neural network (DBN) as the detection engine. Our approach is to model the files as grayscale images and use the DBN to classify those images into the aforementioned two classes. An extensive data set of 10,000 files is used to train the DBN. Validation is carried out using 4,000 files previously unexposed to the network. The final result of whether to allow or block a file is obtained by arriving at a proof of work based consensus in the blockchain network.

AB With the increasingly serious problem of food safety in China, it directly or indirectly endangers people's health, quality of life and safety of life. The global economy, politics and society as a whole have a greater impact. As an effective means of product quality and safety management and control, many countries and regions have been researched, developed and operated of the traceability system. On the one hand, these technologies have not been able to achieve more accurate traceability, these results cannot be directly used in Chinese market. Therefore, the article introduces the concept of Blockchain technology, putting forward the application of Blockchain technology in information security of the food supply chain and comparing it with the traditional supply chain system.

AB The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services ad applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law.
   However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data security and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - already in force from 24 May 2016 - that will be applicable on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data.
   The IoT ecosystem is evolving quickly, developing several applications in different sectors. The main topics for the last time are Big Data and the blockchain. People are paying attention to the latest one because of its potential concrete use for services and applications, increasing the security measures to guarantee a secure system. However, it is equally important to analyse the legal issues related to them. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In this context, we cannot dismiss to guarantee an adequate protection of personal data designing any application. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection especially regarding the blockchain, focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a worldwide privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities.

AB In recent years novel models for energy distribution appeared and islanded microgrids quest for new ways to exchange energy between consumers and producers without the need of central authorities. The blockchain mechanism has emerged as a distributed solution for recording energy transactions in power systems. The blockchain has been used to permit users bartering and selling energy and to keep track of such exchanges without exposing them to tampering. In this work, we consider a novel application of the blockchain in islanded microgrids that includes also annotating energy losses caused by energy transactions, in order to have a more realistic matching between the physical status of the energy grid and the consequent costs attributed to users. To validate our novel use of the blockchain, we carried out simulated experiments for an exemplary islanded microgrid, in which 3 main generators supply 6 load nodes. This validates the compatibility of this new cost attribution model with the supporting physical infrastructure. Preliminary results demonstrate that the superposition of energy transactions in a microgrid changes the distribution of losses in all paths, eventually due to the large reactive flows created by PV systems.

AB Remote attestation is used to enable verifiers to check if an underlying Trusted Computing Base TCB) of a device and data from the TCB are trustworthy. However, the current remote attestation has limitations to be deployed in IoT from the perspective of the management in a massive and diverse collection of TCB measurements and the redundant execution of remote attestation. To mitigate these limitations, we present a trustworthy management of TCB measurements called TM-Coin TCB Measurement-Coin) using the blockchain and ARM TrustZone. The TM-Coin transactions and protocol are presented to manage the TCB measurements of IoT devices using the blockchain, a decentralized database. The trusted execution environment provided by ARM TrustZone is used as the TCB to generate the TM-Coin transactions securely. Based on TM-Coin, the verifiers launch remote attestation of sensed data from the devices using the TCB measurements published in the blockchain without attesting to the TCB. We implemented a prototype to evaluate the performance overhead caused by TM-Coin.

AB Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.

AB The blockchain technology can be regarded as a groundbreaking invention with the potential to bring the digital revolution to the next stage by helping to realize peer economy solutions. The blockchain technology and the concept of blockchain immutability is discussed. The benefits of early standardization of the blockchain technology are argued based on the literature and the analysis of the central blockchain immutability characteristic. From this, a framework is proposed aimed at understanding the dimensions and boundaries of blockchain immutability. The resulting framework is suggested as a good practice standard for the implementation of blockchain systems. Based on these efforts, the article supports initiatives to better exploit the blockchain technology's full potential by standardization.

AB Blockchain is here to stay. Some affirm that it is the next big thing after the Internet. Blockchain is a network-based technology that rewards participants to assemble transactions which will next configure blocks and later be part of a chain. Blockchain guarantees immutability and integrity of data without the need of a third suryeilling party. It is therefore a revolution in current systems of trust. It also brings automation and self-execution of processes thanks to its embedded smart contracts functionality. Current standards drafting and development processes can definitively benefit from blockchain technology, and perhaps see the standardization domain revolutionize, like it already happened in the fintech and insurtech arenas [1]. In this paper, we explain what these advantages are. And, before new standard drafting models emerge from the disruptive blockchain community, challenging traditional standard development models -with this paper-, we want to inspire and give tools to established standardization bodies for them to take the lead and initiate a transformation towards 'Blockchained Standards' so that they can keep their authority and leadership in the field going forward.

DE Enterprise ontology; Business model ontology; REA; Blockchain
AB Blockchain technology is regarded as highly disruptive, but there is a lack of formalization and standardization of terminology. Not only because there are several (sometimes propriety) implementation platforms, but also because the academic literature so far is predominantly written from either a purely technical or an economic application perspective. The result of the confusion is an offspring of blockchain solutions, types, roadmaps and interpretations. For blockchain to be accepted as a technology standard in established industries, it is pivotal that ordinary internet users and business executives have a basic yet fundamental understanding of the workings and impact of blockchain. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical contribution and guidance on what blockchain actually is by taking an ontological approach. Enterprise Ontology is used to make a clear distinction between the datalogical, infological and essential level of blockchain transactions and smart contracts.

AB We present "Ouroboros", the first blockchain protocol based on proof of stake with rigorous security guarantees. We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a "proof of stake" blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing Proof of Stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining.

TI Blockchain: properties and misconceptions

   Technologies and protocols; Emergent system properties; Secure and
   correct systems; Smart contracts
AB Purpose - The purpose of this article is to clarify current and widespread misconceptions about the properties of blockchain technologies and to describe challenges and avenues for correct and trustworthy design and implementation of distributed ledger system (DLS) or Technology (DLT).
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors contrast the properties of a blockchain with desired, however emergent, properties of a DLS, which is a complex and distributed system. They point out and justify, with facts and analysis, current misconceptions about the blockchain and DLSs. They describe challenges that these systems will need to address and possible solution avenues for achieving trustworthiness.
   Findings - Many of the statements that have appeared on the internet, news and academic articles, such as immutable ledger and exact copies, may bemisleading. These are desired emergent properties of a complex system, not assured properties. It is well-known within the distributed systems and critical software community that it is extremely hard to prove that a complex system correctly and completely implements emergent properties. Further research and development for trustworthy DLS design and implementation is needed, both practical and theoretical.
   Research limitations/implications - This is the first known published attempt at describing current misconceptions about blockchain technologies. Further collaborative work, discussions, potential solutions, evaluations, resulting publications and verified reference implementations are needed to ensure DLTs are safe, secure, and trustworthy.
   Practical implications - Interdisciplinary teams with members from academia, business and industry, and from disciplines such as business, entrepreneurship, theoretical and practical computer science, cybersecurity, finance, mathematics and statistics, must be formed. Such teams must collaborate with the objective of developing strategies and techniques for ensuring the correctness and security of future DLSs in which our society may become dependent.
   Originality value - The value and originality of this article is twofold: the disproving, through fact collection and systematic analysis, of current misconceptions about the properties of the blockchain and DLSs, and the discussion of challenges to achieving adequate trustworthiness along with the proposal of general avenues for possible solutions.

DE Finance
AB Purpose - In Korea and abroad, this paper investigates the use of blockchains in the financial sector. This study aims to examine how blockchains are applied to the financial sector and how to respond to the Korean conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper investigates the movements of the financial sector and related services using the blockchain in the current market.
   Findings - First, as a result of examining domestic and foreign cases, it can be seen that the areas where blockchains are most actively applied in the financial sector are expanding into settlement, remittance, securities and smart contracts. Also, in Korea, many of the authentication procedures based on the equipment possessed by the consumers are used so that introduction of the blockchain in the authentication part is prominent. Second, the move to introduce a closed (private) distributed ledger that does not go through the central bank is accelerating in payments between banks. Third, domestic financial institutions also need joint action by financial institutions through a blockchain consortium to apply blockchain technology to the financial sector. Fourth, consumer needs and technological developments are changing. At the same time, as the opportunity to infringe on the information held by individuals has expanded, the need for blockchain technology is strongly emerging because of the efforts of the organizations to defend it.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to understanding the changes in the financial sector using the blockchain.

AB Purpose - The centralized processes of today's power trading systems are complex and pose a risk of price tampering and hacking. The decentralized and unmodifiable nature of the blockchain technology that has recently been highlighted offers the potential to improve this power trading process. The purpose of this study is to implement a system to apply the blockchain technology to the problem of power trading.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors modeled the power trading problem as the interaction between admin, producer and consumer nodes. And a power trading scenario has been created for this model using a blockchain platform called Multichain which is both fast and highly scalable. To verify this scenario, they implemented a trading system using Savoir, a Python-based JsonRPC module.
   Findings - Experimental results show that all processes, such as blockchain creation, node connectivity, asset issuance and exchange transactions have been correctly handled according to the scenario.
   Originality/value - In this study, the authors have proposed and implemented a power trading method that determines price according to the pure market principle and cannot be manipulated or hacked. It is based on the nature of blockchain technology that is decentralized and cannot be tampered.

DE Case study; Business model innovation; Blockchain; Distributed
AB Purpose - Blockchain is a distributed ledger, in which the blocks containing transaction details are connected chronologically to form a series of chains, thus raising the possibility of improving the process and innovating business model for the financial institutions. The purpose of this paper is to study the actual cases of Blockchain applied in Korea in 2017, so that a vision of business model innovation of financial institutions can be drawn.
   Design/methodology/approach - The financial institutions in Korea are in the technology verification stage to introduce Blockchain technology. Since there is an insufficient amount of actual measurement data, case study method was adopted. The authors interviewed ICT officers of major banks in Korea. The purpose of the interview was to understand the relationship between Blockchain and business models of financial institutions, and the effects and challenges that Blockchain has on the business model of financial institutions.
   Findings - From the perspective of financial institutions, the emergence of Blockchain does not just have technical significance - emergence of highly efficient database system - but has the possibility that if the business model of existing financial intermediaries disappears or get reduced, the financial services relying on them can disappear altogether, or some of them can be replaced, and financial transaction patterns of consumers can be changed. As a case studies researched for this paper, it was discovered that the distributed characteristic of Blockchain cannot be applied when actually developing financial services.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate a blockchain-based solution for transparently managing and analyzing data in a pay-as-you-go car insurance application. This application allows drivers who rarely use cars to only pay insurance premium for particular trips they would like to travel. One of the key challenges from database perspective is how to ensure all the data pertaining to the actual trip and premium payment made by the users are transparently recorded so that every party in the insurance contract including the driver, the insurance company, and the financial institution is confident that the data are tamper-proof and traceable.
   Another challenge from information retrieval perspective is how to perform entity matching and pattern matching on customer data as well as their trip and claim history recorded on the blockchain for intelligent fraud detection. Last but not least, the drivers' trip history, once have been collected sufficiently, can be much valuable for the insurance company to do offline analysis and build statistics on past driving behaviour and past vehicle runtime. These statistics enable the insurance company to offer the users with transparent and individualized insurance quotes. Towards this end, we develop a blockchain-based solution for micro-insurance applications that transparently keeps records and executes smart contracts depending on runtime conditions while also connecting with off-chain analytic databases.

AB Ever increasing adoption of cloud technology scales up the activities like creation, exchange, and alteration of cloud data objects, which create challenges to track malicious activities and security violations. Addressing this issue requires implementation of data provenance framework so that each data object in the federated cloud environment can be tracked and recorded but cannot be modified. The blockchain technology gives a promising decentralized platform to build tamper-proof systems. Its incorruptible distributed ledger/blockchain complements the need of maintaining cloud data provenance. In this paper, we present a cloud based data provenance framework using block chain which traces data record operations and generates provenance data. We anchor provenance data records into block chain transactions, which provide validation on provenance data and preserve user privacy at the same time. Once the provenance data is uploaded to the global block chain network, it is extremely challenging to tamper the provenance data. Besides, the provenance data uses hashed user identifiers prior to uploading so the blockchain nodes cannot link the operations to a particular user. The framework ensures that the privacy is preserved. We implemented the architecture on ownCloud, uploaded records to blockchain network, stored records in a provenance database and developed a prototype in form of a web service.

AB FinTech, the phenomenon which spans over the areas of information technologies and financial innovation, is currently on the rise and is gaining more and more attention from practitioners, investors and researchers. FinTech is broadly discussed by the media, which constitutes its understanding and represents social opinion, however, this perception of FinTech should be supported by empirical evidences. Therefore, we examine five Swiss FinTech companies through the lens of the conceptual framework of understanding of FinTech and its dimensions and, by doing so, analyze the nature of FinTech innovations. Thereby, we extend the understanding of FinTech and provide a fruitful soil for further research in this area.

AB Objective: The main purpose of the paper is to show that blockchain technology may disrupt the existing business models and to explore how this may occur.
   Research Design & Methods: This is a theory development paper which relies on a literature review and desk re-search. The discussion of the reviewed sources leads to the formulation of three re-search propositions.
   Findings: The paper provides a short overview of key literature on business models and business model innovation, indicating, among others, that new technologies may be one of the drivers of business model innovation. This study also provides an overview of blockchain technology and a range of its business applications showing how it can disrupt business models. It is shown that blockchain technology may affect many dimensions of business models. We propose that there are three crucial ways in which blockchain technology can affect and disrupt business models: by authenticating traded goods, via disintermediation and via lowering transaction costs.
   Implications & Recommendations: This study shows that blockchain technology may affect diverse dimensions of business models in diverse industries. It is recommended that mangers should follow developments in this field in order to prepare for possible disruptions in their industries.
   Contribution & Value Added: This study provides an analysis of the possible impact of blockchain technology on business model innovation. Blockchain technology is gaining momentum with more and more diverse applications, as well as increasing numbers of actors involved in its applications. This paper contributes to our understanding of the possible applications of blockchain technology to businesses, and in particular to its impact on business models.

AB Introduction: The globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has introduced new challenges, chief among them, fighting the international criminal trade in fake medicines. As the manufacture, supply, and distribution of drugs becomes more complex, so does the need for innovative technology-based solutions to protect patients globally.
   Areas covered: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the science/health, information technology, computer science, and general academic literature with the aim of identifying cutting-edge existing and emerging 'digital' solutions to combat fake medicines. Our review identified five distinct categories of technology including mobile, radio frequency identification, advanced computational methods, online verification, and blockchain technology.
   Expert opinion: Digital fake medicine solutions are unifying platforms that integrate different types of anti-counterfeiting technologies as complementary solutions, improve information sharing and data collection, and are designed to overcome existing barriers of adoption and implementation. Investment in this next generation technology is essential to ensure the future security and integrity of the global drug supply chain.

TI MeDShare: Trust-Less Medical Data Sharing Among Cloud Service Providers

AB The dissemination of patients' medical records results in diverse risks to patients' privacy as malicious activities on these records cause severe damage to the reputation, finances, and so on of all parties related directly or indirectly to the data. Current methods to effectively manage and protect medical records have been proved to be insufficient. In this paper, we propose MeDShare, a system that addresses the issue of medical data sharing among medical big data custodians in a trust-less environment. The system is blockchain-based and provides data provenance, auditing, and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities. MeDShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodian system. In MeDShare, data transitions and sharing from one entity to the other, along with all actions performed on the MeDShare system, are recorded in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control mechanism to effectively track the behavior of the data and revoke access to offending entities on detection of violation of permissions on data. The performance of MeDShare is comparable to current cutting edge solutions to data sharing among cloud service providers. By implementing MeDShare, cloud service providers and other data guardians will be able to achieve data provenance and auditing while sharing medical data with entities such as research and medical institutions with minimal risk to data privacy.
