AB In this paper, we address the issue of electricity trading in residential electricity market. In recent years, the residential electricity trading has draw more and more attention, the households that produce excessive electricity sell electricity to households that lack of electricity, however the existence of the manage center brings a huge risk to users, once the center goes crashed, the households will suffer economics losses and there is a great possibility of the leakage of users' personal information. To tackle these issues, we propose a peer-to-peer electricity trading mechanism based on blockchain, under our mechanism each user has a distributed ledger maintained by all households and there is no existence of such a manage center, eliminating the danger of all users suffering huge economic losses when the management center goes crashed. Besides, each user in the market can have multiple virtual addresses that are used to sell and purchase electricity, and other users cansellers submit trading information includes unit pricenot identify their identities via virtual addresses, these virtual addresses protect users' privacy from leaking. The experimental results show the consumption of our proposed mechanism is logical and small, which illustrates the reasonability of our mechanism in time consumption.

AB Several problems exist in scientific research project management systems (SRPMSs), such as forgery, tampering, and plagiarism in project application. Additionally, withdrawal and misappropriation of funds in the course of projects and qualitative analysis and evaluation of the expected results of projects consisting of papers, monographs, (tests) reports, and patent inventions during project review remain a challenging task for SRPMS. Blockchain is a distributed database that is maintained by the entire network. It maintains all historical transaction data. This paper proposes researchain using blockchain for SRPMSs and analyzes the key technologies of each module in this model This provides a new method for the construction of science research management platform.

AB Bitcoin and Smart Contract are the first major applications of the BlockChain technology. But, with increasing the number of transactions, the process of verification on every transaction is very slow. This is the reason for a third major innovation called a BlockChain scaling. The scalability is a process of taking certain steps in accelerating the performing of transactions in this new technology.
   In this paper we analyze the possibilities for BlockChain scalability and we examine the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions.

AB This paper presents a simulation analysis of data dissemination algorithms using existing Tendermint blockchain client- server system as an example. Algorithm analysis is connected with the Mempool component of the aforementioned system, which is responsible for disseminating data through the network. It is currently implemented in a way that it guarantees a certain outcome, yet it produces a large overhead. Simulation will show that one of the proposed solutions reduces the redundancy by 56.53% (or 3.62 times) on average, which is a significant improvement.

AB Large number of stakeholders is interested in data stored in land administration systems (LASs), so it is understandable that data quality in LASs is of utmost importance. Data in LASs are often in incorrect state since they are not in accordance with reality. Since data stored in LASs are considered to be correct in all legal affairs, these incorrectnesses could be a cause for large number of problems. Blockchain technology, more precisely smart contracts, could bring improvements to process of registering transactions in LASs. In this paper, two presented case studies propose improvements that would result in faster process of executing transactions and elimination of possibility of "double spending".

AB Healthcare-related technology has been growing exponentially, from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and personal health trackers to population health management tools. Currently, data from these sources is largely archived, analyzed separately or using only cursory integration with other data sources. In this study, we propose a coupled AI-Blockchain EHR management system. The goal is to provide a platform that leverages blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) for (i) secure EHR management, (ii) efficient data integration, and (iii) reliable computer-aided diagnoses. A goal-oriented modeling approach with the Constrained Goal Model (CGM) is used to elicit the system requirements. Questionnaire results for a case study in Abu Dhabi, UAE served for model validation and refinement for maximizing the number of system users.

ID ACCESS-CONTROL
AB Electronic Medical Records - EMR has been an increasingly major area of research in order to improve quality of health services, by reducing attention time, probability of errors and helping all the actors in the ecosystem for accountability and traceability. However, patients are probably one of the actors that, despite being the main actor to be protected by regulations, have the least access to its information and control over what, who, when, how and why other actors in the healthcare system are doing with their information, especially in cases where just the existence of some tests may reveal an illness or a condition that should remain private. There is existing work and regulations on defining user-centered access control to the data, but the options are usually focused on defining policies on who has access to the information. This work introduces an incremental data access options in order to increase privacy over the data by considering the possibility of offering slightly altered or obfuscated data as an option to protect the original information, revealing just enough to enable the desired services. A differential privacy classification of access is presented, tested on lab data and evaluated, showing that different levels of privacy protection can be used in certain cases and for a limited number of services, while preserving privacy of the data. In addition, this technique can be integrated with other access-control techniques in literature.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) technology is emerging to advance the modern defense and warfare applications because the battlefield things, such as combat equipment, warfighters, and vehicles, can sense and disseminate information from the battlefield to enable real-time decision making on military operations and enhance autonomy in the battlefield. Since this Internet-of-Battlefield Things (IoBT) environment is highly heterogeneous in terms of devices, network standards, platforms, connectivity, and so on, it introduces trust, security, and privacy challenges when battlefield entities exchange information with each other. To address these issues, we propose a Blockchain-empowered auditable platform for IoBT and describe its architectural components, such as battlefield-sensing layer, network layer, and consensus and service layer, in depth. In addition to the proposed layered architecture, this paper also presents several open research challenges involved in each layer to realize the Blockchain-enabled IoBT platform.

AB A secure communications infrastructure featuring email, chat, and a MIPR application was developed to a proof of concept level using a blockchain database to store the contents. The blockchain, which already provides a completely secure method of exchanging cryptocurrencies, can be extended to any transactional or communications paradigm. Email applications are described in which application-level standard protocols (e.g. SMTP, POP3, IMAP) were enhanced to optionally allow messages to be routed through a blockchain using familiar client applications such as MS Outlook or Thunderbird. Chat applications are discussed similarly, using the IRC protocol and a custom web-based protocol based on Socket. IO. A MIPR application is also featured where the ability of multiple parties to sign documents and release funds is illustrated. The integrity of the blockchain, inherent in its distributed nature, is discussed along with enhanced software to enable quick recovery from a breach.

AB Distributed ledgers and blockchains have been heralded as a new and universally applicable architecture for management of trust. In this article we investigate what are the possible advantages of using distributed ledger technology within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations and what are possible use cases for such use. We also analyze different types of distributed ledgers proposed in the literature in respect to their applicability in context of federated military operations. Finally, we describe in more detail a specific use case, related to use of blockchain as new approach to implementing trusted binding mechanism for detached labels as stipulated in the NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4778, which is now undergoing a ratification process within NATO.

AB In many envisioned IoT applications, security is crucial. However, designing and/or deploying existing security techniques in IoT systems is not straightforward due to the inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices as well as their huge number. A critical security building block is represented by the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) relying on Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, even a single-point-of-failure in a PKI may affect entire IoT systems due to its centralized nature. Failures have far reaching effects as the number of IoT devices increases. Furthermore, it is difficult for the owners of IoT devices to manage the certificates for their IoT devices since there are no standard protocols for retrieving, installing and updating the certificates. As a result, IoT device manufacturers often install certificates on the devices on behalf of the owners of the devices, which introduces the risk that the private keys of the devices are leaked by the manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a decentralized PKI for IoT, called IoT-PKI, which utilizes distributed nodes in a blockchain network instead of CAs, and thus addresses scalability. IoT-PKI protects against key leakages at device manufacturers since it allows the owners of IoT devices to manage the certificates of their IoT devices. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of IoT-PKI through our prototype implementation and experiments.

AB Blockchain is the one of leading technology of this time; it has started to revolutionize several fields like, finance, business, industry, smart home, healthcare, social networks, Internet and the Internet of Things. It has many benefits like, decentralized network, robustness, availability, stability, anonymity, auditability and accountability. The applications of Blockchain are emerging, and it is found that most of the work is focused on its engineering implementation. While the theoretical part is very less considered and explored. In this paper we implemented the simulation of mining process in Blockchain based systems using queuing theory. We took the parameters of one of the mature Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's real data and simulated using M/ M/ n/ L queuing system in JSIMgraph. We have achieved realistic results; and expect that it will open up new research direction in theoretical research of Blockchain based systems.

AB it is a web and cellular-based app designed commonly for use in the meals & beverage enterprise. These apps solve the problems of labour cost in the restaurants and food court resulting in an increase in overall business. It also provides the owner to manage and make changes as per the requirements in the shop. The customer can order their food by accessing the food app through their mobile. The shopkeeper can easily complete the order in time, as there will be a regular check-in for the availability of ingredients.
   In this paper, we will be representing the overall description and software requirement specification of the entire system designed for use in different food courts. Our apps will provide the restaurant employees to manage their online menu and keep track of all the orders placed by their customers. The customers will be able to access the menu from anywhere so they can order their food and collect it immediately after it is ready. Inside this paper, we have depicted a general model of the framework, layouts of functional and non-functional prerequisites, and a definite portrayal of the UI. Eventually, this idea represents an account of the expansion of the device alongside predicted protection.

AB With the construction and implementation of the government information resources sharing mechanism, the protection of citizens' privacy has become a vital issue for government departments and the public. This paper discusses the risk of citizens' privacy disclosure related to data sharing among government departments, and analyzes the current major privacy protection models for data sharing. Aiming at the issues of low efficiency and low reliability in existing e-government applications, a statistical data sharing framework among governmental departments based on local differential privacy and blockchain is established, and its applicability and advantages are illustrated through example analysis. The characteristics of the private blockchain enhance the security, credibility and responsiveness of information sharing between departments. Local differential privacy provides better usability and security for sharing statistics. It not only keeps statistics available, but also protects the privacy of citizens.

An autonomous credit system is proposed to reform and address the issues of the current systems based on self-regulating blockchain data and programmable smart contracts. The autonomous credit system is trading-oriented to satisfy all the involved trading participants. A blockchain creditworthiness ecosystem is developed to implement the credit system as it provides an open, equal and creditworthy infrastructure. And it is through a collection of smart contracts that all the blockchain operations are processes. A creditworthiness model is developed to implement the credit system to be integrated, traceable, dynamic and personalized. Several pilot projects have been developed to test the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed autonomous credit system. Four creditworthiness clouds have been developed as public blockchain clients and creditworthiness lookup services.

   service
AB To support authors' benefits, reduce brokerage, identify accidence-raised liabilities, and make fair reviews to inspire quality writings, an author-centered media blockchain ecosystem is proposed and its principles, technical design and implementation issues are discussed in this article. The media ecosystem is operated autonomously on a smart contract-based consortium blockchain, with which three public facilities are provided for the participants, i.e., a composing service for authors, a media service for publishers, and an evaluation service for third-party creditworthiness providers. The media ecosystem repositions the authors' and the publishers' role involved in the publishing process, in which the authors' writings would neither be submitted to, nor evaluated by the media. The authors hold their writings and have the right to release them through the ecosystem. The writings are evaluated by a third-party creditworthiness provider and their information on composing, updating, reading, circulating and comments are traced and won't be interfered.

AB In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued and disruptive. Several researches have presented a merge between blockchain and current application i.e. medical, supply chain, and e-commerce. Although Blockchain architecture does not have a standard yet, IBM, MS, AWS offer BaaS (Blockchain as a Service). In addition to the current public chains i.e. Ethereum,,NEO, and Cardeno; there are some differences between several public ledgers in terms of development and architecture. This paper introduces the main factors that affect integration of Artificial Intelligence with Blockchain. As well as, how it could be integrated for forecasting and automating; building self-regulated chain.

AB The recent advances in distributed energy systems require new models for exchanging energy among prosumers in microgrids. The blockchain technology promises to solve the digital issues related to distributed systems without a trusted authority and to allow quick and secure energy transactions, which are verified and cryptographically protected. Transactions are approved and subsequently recorded on all the machines participating in the blockchain. This work demonstrates how users, which are nodes of the energy and digital networks, exchange energy supported by a customized blockchain based on Tendermint. We focus on the procedures for generating blocks and defining data structures for storing energy transactions.

AB The growing demand for safety in urban environments is supported by monitoring using video surveillance. The need to analyze multiple video-flows from different cameras deployed around the city by heterogeneous owners introduces vulnerabilities and privacy issues. Video frames, timestamps, and camera settings can be digitally manipulated by malicious users; the positions of cameras, their orientation and their mechanical settings can be physically manipulated. Digital and physical manipulations may have several effects, including the change of the observed scene and the potential violation of neighbors' privacy. To face these risks, we introduce BlockSee, a blockchain-based video surveillance system that jointly provides validation and immutability to camera settings and surveillance videos, making them readily available to authorized users in case of events. The encouraging results obtained with BlockSee pave the way to new distributed city-wide monitoring systems.

A new paradigm, the "blockchain", enables economic actors to completely decentralize information flows without intermediaries. Even though many technological locks still exist today, it becomes possible already today to imagine that each machine or connected object will be able to communicate autonomously and securely with others, learn and enrich its mode of operation thanks to artificial intelligence technologies. The business models will be strongly impacted by a greater flexibility of the manufacturing capacities, their adaptation in real time to consumer constraints and the optimization of supply management (raw material, energy and components) through smart purchase, onsite production, 3D-printing and smart logistics: a fractal production with shorter supply channels steered by resources and energy efficiency data.

AB Self-consumption and local energy communities have a significant role to play for the energy transition and the development of renewable energies. This paper introduces a blockchain-based solution designed to serve energy communities sharing solar energy. This solution has been defined and developed to manage the energy exchanges according to the rules set by the energy community. It harnesses the available smart metering infrastructure installed by the DSO, as the trusted party for energy data to the energy stakeholders, to stay focused on the governance of the energy community. This paper summarizes the characteristics and field-proven benefits of the implementation.

AB As more and more distributed renewable energy resources are integrated to the grid, the traditional consumers have become the prosumers who can sell back their surplus energy to the others who are in energy shortage. This peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction framework benefits the end users, financially and in term of energy security; and the network operators, in term of flexibility in DRES management, peak load shifting and regulation of voltage/frequency. Environmentally, P2P energy transaction also helps to reduce carbon footprint, reduces DRES payback period and incentivizes the installation of DRES. The current centralized market model is no longer suitable and it is therefore necessary to develop an adapted decentralized architecture for the advanced P2P energy transaction framework intra/intermicrogrid. In this paper, we discuss several distributed ledger approaches for such framework: Blockchain, Block Lattice and Directed Acyclic Graph (the Tangle). The technical advantages of these architectures as well as the persistent challenges are then considered.

AB The underlying or core technology of Bitcoin cryptocurrency has become a blessing for human being in this era. Everything is gradually changing to digitization in this today's epoch. Bitcoin creates virtual money using Blockchain that's become popular over the world. Blockchain is a shared public ledger, and it includes all transactions which are confirmed. It is almost impossible to crack the hidden information in the blocks of the Blockchain. However, there are certain security and technical challenges like scalability, privacy leakage, selfish mining, etc. which hampers the wide application of Blockchain. In this paper, we briefly discuss this emerging technology namely Blockchain. In addition, we extrapolate in-depth insight on Blockchain technology.

AB There has been a vast increase in incidents related to multimedia copyright and security breaches in the past few years, compromising users' privacy. One such breach involved the seventh season of the TV series "Game of Thrones", where episodes were illegally downloaded before the official release date etc. Such security breaches raise questions about the approaches and models that currently apply to data privacy and security, where the user saves and distributes his data personally or depends on a third party or stakeholder to manage the distribution rights of sensitive data. When it comes to multimedia, many companies or multimedia owners rely on third parties. distributors and sales persons to monitor their publicity, maintain their popularity and sell their multimedia content. Blockchain technology, which was originally devised for the digital currency (cryptocurrency), has distinct features such as distributed networking, data privacy, trust less computing etc. This technology attracts great interest from the research community due to its innovative properties which can he applied to many business applications, one being access control over data.
   In this paper, we present a decentralized data management framework that ensures user data privacy and control. We propose a protocol that uses blockchain technology to take control of the user's data. This protocol enables the user to have full control over his multimedia files and he doesn't need to trust a third party. The framework allows the user to not only store data but also to query and share data as well as auditing. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions of blockchain technology as a medium to ensure privacy, data control, auditing and trust management in different areas.

AB Blockchain technology has been seeing widespread interest as a means to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data in a trustless environment. They are designed to protect data from both internal and external cyberattacks by utilizing the aggregated power of the network to resist malicious efforts. In this article, we will create our own decentralized messaging application utilizing the Ethereum Whisper protocol. Our application will be able to send encrypted messages both securely and anonymously. We will utilize the Ethereum platform to deploy our blockchain network. This application would be resistant to most suppression tactics due to its distributed nature and adaptability of its communication protocol.

AB Banks play an important role in the financial market, and their profit mainly comes from loan service. Traditional risk management approaches, as the key part in the loan services, still have several issues including low data credibility, unreliable checking and alert delay. We propose a novel dynamic credit risk management system which leverages edge-based blockchain technology to improve the performance and provide a fair loan environment. Besides, we discuss the potential challenges that the system may face, such as data standards, security on edge and scalability.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have attracted much attention during the last decade. In recent years, a trend of combining Internet of Things (IoT) devices with blockchain technology has emerged. Digital payments can be made on front-end IoT devices, while a back-end blockchain serves as a distributed ledger to ensure the validity of payments across the system. Nevertheless, fast payments are usually on demand in such a scenario, but an open problem still remains on how to protect blockchain-based systems from double-spending attacks in the context of fast payment. Off-chain techniques, such as Lightning Network and Raiden Network, act as countermeasures to this problem, but they all suffer from the hidden transactions problem. To combat this problem, we propose FastPay, a solution for achieving secure fast payments in blockchain-backed edge-IoT systems. Preliminary evaluation on our prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of FastPay.

AB At a time when the digital economy is emerging, the preservation and multiplication of intellectual capital, which is currently a key factor in social development, are paramount. The national economy's orientation toward the use of modern achievements of the digital industry will contribute to a faster transition to the global information society. Digitalization of education will make it possible to use the latest scientific achievements for the development of other areas of life in society.
   This study presents a model that applies distributed registry technologies based on blockchains and smart contracts for the reliable storage and efficient use of date relating to the population's professional competencies. This model aims to create a unified information environment for interaction between all the actors of the economic system. The authors developed the model for registering professional competencies of the population and their developmental paths based on modem digital technologies. We substantiate the efficiency and security assured by blockchain technology for information storage and transmission. Educational institutions of all levels, governmental authorities controlling education, and people taking part in the educational process are the basic actors of the system presented.
   The proposed model presents the educational level and professional skills of each registered person as an education index (ED, which keeps track of all educational achievements and professional competencies of the participant over their lifetime. When calculating the EI , the authors also propose to consider ratings of the educational institutions responsible for the participant's professional skills. The implementation of the EI will significantly simplify the process of employing graduates from various educational institutions, as well as the college admissions process. In addition, analytic tools could be used to create ratings of colleges, school departments, and even specific teachers. The registry of professional competencies we developed is directed at the processing and storage of large volumes of data (Big Data). In the future, this will allow us to open access to the registry to employers, pension insurance funds, and other state authorities that require complete and reliable personal data.

AB IT capability directly impacts organizational performance as well as internal and external cooperation, especially in the field of e-business. Blockchain, as an emerging information technology, has led to a significant trend involving IT-based transformation in recent years. However, despite fruitful research on IT capability and IT-based business innovation, the understanding on the applications of Blockchain technology remains unclear. Our study investigates the applications of this new Information Technology by examining a case study of HNA Group (formerly Hainan Airline), one of the Fortune 500 Companies. The findings of this case show that Blockchain brings a new IT capability - hybrid capability. This case highlights how to leverage Blockchain and its capability to create a new IT application and business model, which contribute to the cooperation between different types of business units in a distributed network. Accordingly, this case shows a new IT-based innovative direction.

AB The optimizing and increasing the efficiency of human resource management in a knowledge-based economy becomes the central issue for research in the field of training and professional integration of high-qualified specialists. The description of competencies and skills required by companies as well as the personal features of candidates, their motivations and interests presented through human resources portfolio and cv need high level of security requirements and agile decentralized methods of governance. Blockchain technologies are able to allow the necessary level of data security and to minimize costs, for this purpose blockchain platform is seen in this paper as a pertinent basis to build a global register of qualification certificates and competency assessment. Developing such a ledger requires coordinating assessments of competencies and qualifications at the global level of business processes, which can be carried out by regulators, for example, government institutions, and on the basis of decentralizing corporate and individual requests, goals and self-actualization motives, which seems more appropriate to the actual practice of creating infrastructure.

AB Public key infrastructures (PKIs), or more generally secure naming systems, lie at the foundation of the security of any communication system. Without a trustworthy binding between user-facing names, such as domain names, and cryptographic identities, such as public keys, all security guarantees against. active attackers come crashing down like a house of cards.
   Blockchains such as Bitcoin, by offering a decentralized yet secure public ledger, show promise as the root of trust for naming systems with no central trusted parties, greatly increasing their security compared to traditional centralized PKIs. Yet blockchain PKIs such as Namecoin and Blockstack tend to significantly sacrifice scalability and flexibility in pursuit of decentralization, hindering large-scale deployability on the Internet.
   We propose Bitforest, a secure naming system with an architecture combining a centralized yet only partially trusted name server with efficiently queryable verification data embedded in a novel data structure inside a cryptocurrency blockchain. Bitforest achieves decentralized trust and security as strong as existing blockchain-based naming systems while retaining most of the flexibility and performance of centralized PKIs, allowing fully validating thin clients to look up and verify name bindings with comparable efficiency to traditional systems. We use both numerical simulation and real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of Bitforest compared with other naming systems, both centralized and blockchain-based, showing that its performance goals are indeed achieved.

AB Recently, the interest in using Blockchain as a secure and distributed ledger has increased dramatically. Although the main purpose of Blockchain by means of Bitcoin was about cryptocurrency and peer to peer transactions, its application to other systems has been widely used. One of the fields that has potential possibilities to benefit from BlockChain features is telecommunication. BlockChain can be applied in case of management of various networks to reduce some expenses. In this position paper, we apply a BlockChain network with smart contract in the cellular mobile networks. The Blockchain can provide a distributed HSS in a way that the core networks of different operators can use it in a secure manner. Moreover, the smart contract can act as a distributed Self Organizing Network features to handle self-transactions among mobile operators in return of sharing small cells' infrastructure.

AB Recently, the global outbreak of a blackmail virus WannaCry, makes the blockchain a hot topic. The security of blockchain is always the focus of people's attention, and it is also the main reason why the blockchain has not been widely used all over the world. Many researches use mathematical derivation method to analyse the 51%-Attacks influence of blockchain, which is very stiff and difficult to understand. In this paper, we propose a method to simulate blockchain's process and discover the rule between attacking method, attacking power and security of blockchain. We take 51%-Attacks as an example and use Java to simulate the running process. By adjusting the value of attacking power, we can get most states of blockchain and analyze the probability that honest state becomes attacking state. We use various forms to analyze and show the experimental result, which verify our method is correct and feasible. This method can also be implemented as a middleware software of blockchain to detect the security of blockchain.

AB Recently digital currency has received significant attention, and among many topics within digital currency, CBDC (Central Bank issued Digital Currency) has been a hot topic as it will affect national currency systems. RSCoin is the first CBDC model sponsored by Bank of England, and it uses the UTXO model from Bitcoin. This paper proposes a new CBDC model Panda model that can store account balance like current banking systems, but use efficient consensus protocols to ensure that relevant parties have consistent views of transactions and accounts. The Panda model is scalable as it can include as many financial institutions or individuals as possible in the system with increasing or decreasing workloads. The model has been simulated in the TaiShan Sandbox in Qingdao.

AB Power systems world-wide are currently undergoing unprecedented change as the global energy mix transitions from primarily fossil-fuel based synchronous generation towards utility-scale and distributed renewable energy generation. This paper explores the rationale for the pursuit of alternative network architectures to facilitate the transition towards high penetration levels of renewable energies. Furthermore, the emerging research field of transactive energy markets and their potential for energy price reductions is presented. The paper examines the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised transactive energy market as a mechanism for permitting higher levels of distributed generation and storage and for energy price reductions, with the Australian energy market used as a case study. The primary contributions of this paper are the development of a decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy market (TEM) and the derivation of an autonomous agent algorithm capable of monitoring the internal states of agents to place bids and offers to the market accordingly. This paper (part 1 of 2) investigates the behaviour of the TEM and agent algorithm when applied to an isolated intergrid architecture level. The simulation results contained here-within demonstrate that the decentralised TEM and distributed agent algorithm operate in accordance with the desired fundamental principles of economics (supply vs demand), with the potential for significant retail energy price reductions and higher levels of renewable energies.

AB A companion paper provided a rigorous argument for research into alternative network architectures and decentralised transactive energy market trading mechanisms, using the Australia electricity sector as a case study. This paper builds upon the previous work to hierarchically scale or integrate the transactive energy market (TEM) mechanism and the proposed network architecture (intergrid) to investigate the behaviour of a completed system. Furthermore, this paper builds upon the idealised agent algorithm model presented in the companion paper to include non-ideal conditions such as network losses, component losses, blockchain fees and Distribution Network Service Provider (DNSP) fees. The simulation results contained here-within verify the hypothesis predicted within the companion paper - the hierarchical scaling of the transactive energy market may reduce the market fluctuations (magnitude and frequency) due to increased competition and availability of supply. The results illustrate the potential of the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised TEM to permit large penetration levels of distributed generation and storage and for retail energy price reductions.

AB The transformation of a traditional city into a Smart City is not a simple task and requires necessarily start from a correct management of energy, which leads to energy efficiency through the sustainable behavior of prosumers. In fact, thanks to new technologies such as IOT and smart appliances, it is possible to induce in the consumer a new type of behavior, not only in energy consumption, but also in the exchange and sale of energy, assuming a fundamental role in Smart Grids Prosumer Side Management appears as a way to manage micro smart grids in a much more complex, volatile and real-time energy market, control and management that are entrusted to Smart Agents and Blockchain to obtain a new model of management of the organs safely and reliably. This paper gives a micromesh model that includes within it a smart home, RES, Electric Vehicle, a control algorithm that leads to the management of the Virtual Power Plant in an adaptive and intelligent way and through the RESCoin (virtual currency linked to RES), so that prosumer facilitated by the process of exchange of energy and money can become the driving of energy transformation in future Smart Cities.

AB Power and energy systems are undergoing unprecedented change driven by many factors like global warming, digitalization, new sorts of renewable energy sources (RESs). Many countries incentivize the installation of RESs with subsidies and programs like a high rate of feed-in tariffs. However, these promotions are not sustainable. Some countries started to decrease the feed-in tariffs due to the cost of RESs are in decline. Since they want to reduce the volatility risk of small-scale RESs, they also don't give capacity for unlicensed plants. Renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) emerge as an alternative to encourage the installation of unlicensed RESs. They can be defined as prosumers in the system. Also, a peer to peer energy trading between cooperatives within the local community might increase the profit of cooperative in the same region. Because of this, the peer to peer business model approach is proposed in this study. The smart contract by using blockchain technology is used in this proposed approach due to making transactions faster, and to provide a dynamic market and blockchain is used to make transactions data secure.

AB This position paper describes how blockchains facilitate the implementation of distributed self-adaptive systems. We demonstrate how the master/slave decentralised control pattern for self-adaptive systems, integrated with a permissioned blockchain, can protect nodes of a network against attacks by continuously adapting the membership of an access control list. Whenever malicious behaviour is detected, consensus on an updated access control list is reached, and that node is removed from the network. Using a smart home, as an example, we demonstrate that a permissioned blockchain is able to maintain a consistent view of a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the presence of malicious nodes.

AB With the diffusion of smart metering devices and the increasing trend in renewable energy investment Ill, the electrical grids arc rapidly changing towards the adoption of decentralized energy networks in which consumers can be also producers (i.e. prosumers). The increased use of renewable and distributed generation is leading the development of Smart Grid and microgrid technologies. In this context new business opportunities can be developed provided that new critical issues for the traditional operators, introduced by decentralization, are addressed properly. As example, grid imbalances can generate Reverse Power Flow (RPF) that is harmful for the equipment since many of the protection and control devices are designed with the assumption that power always flows in one direction. In this paper, we present results from the ongoing project eDREAM (enabling new Demand REsponse Advanced, Market oriented and Secure technologies, solutions and business models) with some extent on requirements and use cases related a decentralized flexibility system based on ledger technologies.

ID DEMAND RESPONSE
AB In the power grid, the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) purchase energy based on a forecast of the user consumption. The forecasts are imperfect, and the corrections of their real-time deviations are managed by a System Operator (SO), which charges the BRPs for the procured imbalances. Flexible consumers, associated with a BRP, can be involved in a demand response (DR) program to reduce the imbalance costs. However, running the DR program requires the BRP to invest resources in the infrastructure and increases its operating costs. To limit the intervention of BRP, we implement the DR via a blockchain smart contract. Moreover, to reduce the delay of publication of the imbalance price, caused by the inefficient accounting process of the current balancing markets, a second blockchain is adopted at the SO layer, procuring a fast and auditable credit settlements. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is evaluated over an Ethereum blockchain platform. The results show that blockchains can enable a high automation of the balancing market, by providing (i) the implementation of aggregators with low operating cost and (ii) the timely and transparent access to the balancing information, thus fostering new business models for the BRPs.

AB The rise of distributed energy generation technologies along with grid constraints, and conventional non-consumer centric business models, is leading many to explore alternative configurations of the energy system. Particularly popular are peer-to-peer energy trading models in which the role of the energy company is replaced with a trustless transaction layer based on a public blockchain. However, to ensure stable operation of microgrids, an energy company is required to constantly balance supply and demand. In this paper, we study the problem that arises from the conflicting goals of prosumers (to make money) and network operators (to keep the network stable) that have to co-exist in future energy systems. We show that prosumers can play large-scale synchronization games to benefit from the system. If they synchronize their actions to artificially increase energy demand on the market, the resulting power peaks will force the microgrid operator to use backup generation capacities and, as a consequence, contribute to the increased profit margins for prosumers. We study synchronization games from a game-theoretical point of view and argue that even non-cooperative selfish prosumers can learn to play synchronization games independently and enforce undesired outcomes for consumers and the grid. We build a simple model where prosumers independently run Q-learning algorithms to learn their most profitable strategies and show that synchronization games constitute a Nash equilibrium. We discuss implications of our findings and argue the necessity of appropriate mechanism design for stable microgrid operation.

AB To address the need for trusted information across bulk power systems, our paper proposes a new type of distributed ledger (or Blockchain), for a shared management of sensitive information in power systems. We call our Blockchain design the Assured Volt Ampere Information Ledger (AVAIL). The AVAIL abstractions fit data needs of prototypical grid applications in wide area protection and control, energy management systems, and markets. The contribution of this paper is to draw directly from the distinct requirements of these applications and the valid assumptions about the adversaries, to shape the AVAIL abstractions. AVAIL is unique for the following features: 1) Adversarial model: Our design principles consider an adversarial model where attacks affect physical resources; 2) Non-binary validity: in our setting we allow for a spectrum of validity; 3) Validity enforcement: validity in our setting is governed by physical laws.

AB The widespread adoption of fax machines in the 1980s revolutionised everyday communications. It was quickly adopted as the standard form of communication across the globe. Since then, the internet has replaced fax as a truly global form of instant communication. However, the fax machine still reigns as the primary form of communication in a number of industries, healthcare being one of them.
   This paper presents a system that uses a blockchain and an off-chain centralised data storage to give patients and medical professionals instant access to their medical records from anywhere. By assigning each medical record a pseudo anonymous identifier, a second layer "blockchain" for each user can be created allowing for the rapid collection and querying of data. The off-chain pseudo anonymous data storage allows for the data to remain unencrypted enabling the rapid generation of anonymous medical datasets which can be used for machine learning and data mining on the data, potentially bringing many benefits to the healthcare industry.

AB Studies suggest that a significant proportion of the diagnosis in non-communicable diseases (NCD) is erroneous, unwanted, or unnecessary. To reduce the disease burden and improve public health, algorithmic support is essential. To realize this, health data must be computer understandable, secured, ubiquitous, and interoperable. Medical and disease data entered into computers are unstructured natural language texts with medical jargons which a computer normally cannot understand. EMR (Electronic Medical Records) are data silos in the hospital and do not interoperate. In this paper we present Ethereum based future ready Proof of Disease (PoD) consensus protocol with a computer understandable single instance of truth. It will solve many challenges that electronic health records (EHR) or health information exchange (HIE) have failed to address. This medical system will help achieve all the complex needs of P6 (Participatory, Personalized, Proactive, Preventive, Predictive and Precision) medicine and finally reduce the disease burden.

DE public randomness; blockchain; verifiable timed commitment
AB We design a protocol based on blockchain, which produces unpredictable, unbiased and publicly verifiable randomness. We use the properties of blockchain to enlarge the scale of participation and output public randomness without trusted third party. And we restructure a timed commitment to make the commitments can be verified, and to ensure that no one can control or bias the value of randomness and it can be verified quickly. Everyone who just need to check the content recorded in blockchain can quickly verify that the randomness produced by our protocol is computationally indistinguishable from uniform distribution and unknown before the end of protocol. And not like the previous works that generate public randomness based on PoW, our protocol does not depend on the cost of mining to guarantee security, so our protocol can generate public randomness based on PoS and other protocols with low consumption.

ID INTERNET
AB The ubiquitous ID (uID) architecture provides dynamic and flexible context-awareness frameworks necessary in ubiquitous computing. Its basic idea is to assign 128 bit unique identifiers, each of which is called a ucode (ubiquitous code), to real-world entities. To guarantee the uniqueness of ucodes, current ucode ownreships are maintained by a hierarchical structure like DNS. In this traditional system, processing ucode transactions between organizations is cumbersome and inefficient because the reliability of owner information is dependent on individual organizations.
   To solve this problem, we designed a ucode ownership management system on a blockchain which is a decentralized platform. In this system, we proposed a blockchain-based ucode allocation method, which requires a simple procedure and only one transaction. This proposed method is user-friendly and efficient compared with ucode allocation methods to which we simply apply current blockchain-based name registration methods requiring a complex procedure and at least two transactions.
   Finally, we conducted a case study about these ucode allocation methods built on the Ethereum blockchain. From this result, we compared the usability and security of each ucode allocation method in Ethereum.

   Number Theory; Numerical Algorithm
AB Collatz conjecture (or 3x+1 problem) has been explored for about 80 years. By now the largest number that has been verified for Collatz conjecture is about 60 bits. In this paper, we propose new algorithms that can verify much greater numbers than known algorithms, i.e., about 100000 bits (30000 digits) on whether they can return 1 after 3*x+1 and x/2 computations. The proposed algorithms change numerical computation to bit computation (or logical computation), and change inner memory data representation to hard disk file manipulation. We make it possible to verify extremely large numbers without concerning computer memory upper-bound. The largest number verified for Collatz conjecture until now in the world is 2(100000) - 1, and this magnitude of extremely large numbers has never been verified. We discovered that this number can return to 1 after 481603 times of 3*x+1 computation, and 863323 times of x/2 computation. At last, we stress that some open problems may be used for the green mining in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, e.g., BTC. We discuss the applicability of Collatz conjecture for the Proof of Work in Blockchain.

AB Mission-critical applications such as industrial control, smart grids, security and surveillance systems are highly dependent on cloud-centric IoT networks. In such networks, the diverse IoT devices harvest the data from the remote environments and relay it to multiple intermediate agents over the wireless links towards the cloud for storage, analysis and decision making. Such systems require highly trustworthy data to guarantee accurate and timely decisions. However, in most of the cases, the IoT data becomes dubious during the transmission towards the cloud. Ensuring data provenance in such a heterogeneous multi-layered system is a critical security issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure data provenance framework for cloud-centric IoT network by utilizing the immutable, deterministic and public nature of the blockchain smart contracts with the traditional cloud infrastructure. In the framework, the cryptographic hash of the device metadata is stored in the blockchain whereas actual data is stored off-chain i.e., in the cloud, making it highly scalable for a dense deployment of IoT devices in the network. Multiple smart contracts are stationed in the blockchain to guarantee the provenance receipt to the data stored in the cloud. The initial evaluation revealed that the proposed framework is highly acceptable in achieving the data provenance for large-scale cloud-centric IoT networks.

AB With the development of social network, network digital sources have become a main kind of information services for users. In social network, user's needs and interpersonal relationships become very rich, thus social network can quickly disseminate digital sources to users. In this paper, we propose a resource transaction framework based on block chain, which is used to disseminate digital resources through social community. Based on block chain technology, the proposed scheme changes the traditional method of charging and can provide the reliability and fairness for every transaction of digital resource.

AB Some recent trends in distributed intelligent systems rely extensively on agent-based approaches. The so-called Multi Agent Systems (MAS) are taking over the management of sensitive data on behalf of their producers and users (e.g., medical records, financial investment, energy market). Therefore, trusted interactions are needed more than ever, while accountability and transparency among the agents seem crucial characteristics to be achieved. To do so, recent trends advocate the use of blockchain technologies (BCT) in MAS. The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can execute programmable transaction logic, and provides a shared, immutable, and transparent append only register of all the actions happening in the network. Although a few theoretical approaches have already been proposed, the quest for such a system consolidating BCT and MAS to guarantee privacy, scalability, transparency, and efficiency continues. This paper presents a reconciling system including BCT within the dynamics of a MAS. Such a system aims at (i) building a solid ground for trusted interactions and (ii) enabling more characterizing feature-based and trustworthy ways of computing agent reputation. The system has been tested in four scenarios with different configurations (regular executions and involving down-agents or malicious behaviors). Finally, the paper summarizes and discusses the experience gained, argues about the strategic choice of binding MAS and BCT, and presents some future challenges.

AB Blockchain technologies are rapidly gaining attention in the multi-agent systems (MAS) community to face critical issues such as trust, secured communications, and data consistency. In particular, the notion of smart contract can be exploited to deploy trustworthy computations automatically executed by the network in a consistent way. MAS coordination modelling and engineering of agents interaction in a MAS thus represents an appealing application field for smart contracts, potentially enabling fully-decentralised, trustworthy coordination. Along this line, we focus on the Ethereum blockchain technology, map it onto LINDA tuple-based coordination model, and discuss two proof of-concept implementations of LINDA on Ethereum. We hence demonstrate conceptual and technical feasibility of blockchain-based coordination in MAS, while emphasising issues of applying the blockchain beyond accountability and identity management.

DE blockchain; storage optimization; distributed storage
AB Mockchain technology has received great attention in recent years. However, the data volume of blockchain grows continuously due to the features that cannot be deleted and can only be added. Currently, the total size of Bitcoin blockchain ledger has reached 200GB. Its high demand for storage space and bandwidth to synchronize data with the network prevents many nodes from joining the network. This is not only not conducive to the expansion of this decentralized network, but also becomes the bottleneck of the development of blockchain technolop% This paper proposes an IPFS-based blockchain data storage model to solve this problem. In this paper, the miners deposit the transaction data into the IPFS network and pack the returned IPFS hash of transaction into the block. Utilizing the characteristics of the IDES network and the features of the IPFS hash, the blockchain data is greatly reduced. The scheme is applied to the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the experimental results, the compression ratio can reach 0.0817. According to the analysis, it also has good performance in terms of security and synchronization speed of new node.

AB Today's commercial model for edge computing services consists in lightweight devices at the network edge connected through the Internet to remote cloud data centers. Microclouds are an alternative vision of edge computing, where the cloud infrastructure runs at the network edge leveraging decentralized resource contributions of a community. But current attempts to build such microclouds lack a collaborative governance system to operate successfully. In this paper we discuss the opportunity to implement with blockchain technologies key services to enable the decentralized collaborative governance of microclouds. A multi agent approach could further contribute to improve the efficiency in the decision making in the collaborative governance service.

AB Executing business processes in a decentralized manner can improve inter-organizational efficacy. For example, blockchain-based process execution allows, at least conceptually, for cross-organizational compatibility, data integration, and integrity assurance without the need for a centralized trusted operator. However, most business processes run in agile and rapidly changing business environments. Updating a decentralized process requires continuous and extensive consensus-building efforts. Reflecting all organizations' business requirements is hardly practicable. Hence, in many real-life scenarios, to support cases with initially unforeseen properties, organizations can allow to bypass the decentralized process and fall-back to local variants. Yet, the decision to bypass or update a given process can have significant social implications since it may encourage a social dynamic that encourages collective avoidance of the decentralized process. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation system to assess the social consequences of approving a bypass under given conditions. The proposed simulation is intended to inform the decision-maker (human or machine) on whether to allow to bypass a process or not. Moreover, we present an architecture for the integration of multi-agent simulation system, local process engine, and decentralized process execution environment, and describe a possible implementation with a particular tool chain.

AB The multi-agent framework is a well-known approach to realize distributed intelligent systems. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly employed in safety- and information-critical domains (e.g., eHealth, cyber-physical systems, financial services, and energy market). Therefore, these systems need to be equipped with mechanisms to ensure transparency and the trustworthiness of the behaviors of their components. Trust can be achieved by employing reputation-based mechanisms. Nevertheless, the existing methods are still unable to fully guarantee the desired accountability and transparency. Aligned with the recent trends, advocating the distribution of trust to avoid the risks of having a single point of failure of the system, this work extends existing efforts on combining blockchain technologies (BCT) and MAS. To attain a trusted environment, we provide the architecture and implementation of a system that allows the agents to interact with each other and enables tracking how their reputation changes after every interaction. Agents reputations are computed transparently using smart contracts. Immutable distributed ledger stores reputation values, as well as services and their evaluations to ensure trustworthy interactions between the agents. We also developed a graphical interface to test different scenarios of interactions between the agents. Finally, we summarize and discuss the experience gained and explain the strategic choices when binding MAS and BCT.

We accomplish this by defining a modular architecture that relies on strong cryptographic assumptions that provide the means to guarantee that the right to be forgotten is being well enforced.

AB Current translation of electrical power systems towards smart grids is encompassing a fundamental change in their structure, as well as operation. These coordinates are setting the paths to be followed by the hardware and software embedded in electrical power systems, as well as technology adaptation to the "open-source" customers' needs and consumption patterns. This paper is following the evolution of energy sector, accompanied by constant improvements of technology, which is providing increasingly complex hardware, which embeds power quality improvement devices, for an efficient operation of electrical power assets. A comprehensive survey of continuous advances of renewable energy sources and storage technology will be presented, which have started the transformation of end-users into energy efficient and clean prosumers, underlining the subsequent energy markets support of peer-to-peer energy trading through novel technologies as blockchain.

AB Blockchain technology is already being exploited in various ways for saving cost with high security to create and manage the distributed system as well as to record information about transactions without the verification of the third party. In addition, the issue of counterfeit certification is making education managers around the world a particular interest. It is a serious problem up to now. Therefore, deploying the system to issuing and verifying digital certificate based on blockchain technology will solve the problem of counterfeit certification which there is not any prior technology really address it. In this study, we propose and implement an issuing and verifying model called UniCert based on UniCoin which is a digital currency built on the blockchain technology. Our diagram can be extended to address many other issues such as anti-counterfeiting, copyright protection of music products, patents, etc.

AB Even with the ability to produce documents digitally, the paperless environment has yet to become a reality in South Africa. Hardcopy documents are still printed daily which makes them susceptible to document fraud. In South Africa, a case was reported recently, where someone who was creating fake documents was exposed. This introduces the challenge when using hardcopy documents which is loss of integrity. Thus, it is vital to have systems in place to verify document integrity and be able to determine when a document has been tampered with. Various techniques have been used to secure documents, yet the challenge persists. The combination of 2D barcodes, digital signatures, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), cryptographic hashing has proved the potential to achieve good results when combined. Recently, blockchain has been added as one of the techniques to be employed for document verification. This paper presents a proposed solution that incorporates the combination of 2D barcodes, OCR, cryptographic hashing and blockchain. As this is still on-going work, experiments are still required to demonstrate the viability of the solution.

AB Although human evolution was primarily driven and inspired by observing nature and natural phenomena, little to no effort was allocated to finding ways in which we can integrate the solutions nature has to offer in the way we organize ourselves as a society and the way we make decisions as individuals or groups. Decision making, as a concrete manifestation of our will, is the fundamental process that allows for meaningful change to happen. Optimizing the way we make decisions and creating correlations between the decisions we make, the actions implied by those decisions and the effects the actions bring on the governed body (individual or group) will allow us to improve both the way we make decisions and the outcome of our decisions, while at the same time help us to identify the primary directives that need to be considered as fundamental parameters when making decisions that affect organic life, with the intention of reaching a consensus, in the form of a universal wise normative that will be unanimously accepted by all humans regardless of gender, nationality, religion etc. For such a consensus to be found we need to identify the natural distinctions that give life its diversity but at the same time acknowledge and understand the existence of the point where everything converges to form a unified and heterogenetic organism. For this scope we will present the solutions nature offers that can be integrated into an actual platform that will fundamentally change the way we govern ourselves as a society and as individuals.

AB This paper presents a distributed Load Balancing Trade Framework (LBTF) with focus on demand response and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) security in smart grid. This comprehensive energy market model LBTF framework can achieve good balance in demand response in two ways. First way is utility-grid contract, which introduced a simple reward policy using distributed proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm in Blockchain to motivate consumer to use less energy in peak hours. Through this policy consensus algorithm reward electric units to the consumers in peak hours. And in second way scheme introduce Micro-grid contract, which is a peer to peer (P2P) trade in global market. Those consumer (prosumer) who can generate energy using renewable resources can sell their surplus energy to other consumer through this contract. Furthermore, hash functions, public key encryption and digital signatures have been used to provide privacy preserving to the consumers and integrity to the stored data.

AB Hospitals provide a considerable amount of questionnaires to patients, and their result data can be one of the significant measures to check a patient's current health. In many cases, however, such data utilization in another kind of healthcare services is unsatisfactory because patients cannot manage the data by themselves. We propose a blockchain-based medical questionnaire management system for data sharing. This system guarantees the integrity of questionnaire result data using characteristics of the blockchain. Furthermore, data in this system can be in interoperable with other systems because it is generated based on the international standard Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. This paper explores how to use medical questionnaire result data for the lifelong healthcare of patient and better quality of health care services and enhance the security of personal medical records.

DE Blockchain; BitTorrent; P2P; Incentives; Free riding; BitCoin
AB Among the various challenges faced by the P2P file sharing systems like BitTorrent, the most common attack on the basic foundation of such systems is: Free-riding. Generally, free-riders are the users in the file sharing network who avoid contributing any resources but tend to consume the resources unethically from the P2P network whereas white-washers are more specific category of free-riders that voluntarily leave the system in a frequent fashion and appearing again and again with different identities to escape from the penal actions imposed by the network. BitTorrent being a collaborative distributed platform requires techniques for discouraging and punishing such user behavior. In this paper, we propose that "Instead of punishing, we may focus more on rewarding the honest peers". This approach could be presented as an alternative to other mechanisms of rewarding the peers like tit-for-tat [10], reciprocity based etc., built for the BitTorrent platform. The prime objective of BitTrusty is: providing incentives to the cooperative peers by rewarding in terms of cryptocoins based on blockchain. We have anticipated three ways of achieving the above defined objective. We are further investigating on how to integrate these two technologies of distributed systems viz. P2P file sharing systems and blockchain, and with this new paradigm, interesting research areas can be further developed, both in the field of P2P cryptocurrency networks and also when these networks are combined with other distributed scenarios.

AB With the evolution of vehicle technology, VANET plays an important role in saving life and property of the drivers by disseminating critical event information. However, the traditional VANET faces several security issues. We propose a new type of blockchain to resolve critical message dissemination issues in VANET. We create a local blockchain for real world event messages exchanged between the vehicles within the scope of the countries. In this paper, we discuss a blockchain suitable for VANET. We present a public blockchain that stores the node trustworthiness and message trustworthiness in a distributed ledger that is appropriate for secure message dissemination.

AB Learning Analytics collect sensitive data from students. In some cases, the ethics behind the use or access by third parties are not clear. This situation raises adverse reactions and feelings of fear that generates a negative perception towards the use of Learning Analytics. In consequence, it is questioned whether privacy and security can be preserved when collecting educational data. As a result, some policies and good practices are set to frame how student data should be used in the application of this analytical approach. Its objective is to increase confidence in the application of Learning Analytics. However, some of these legal actions, which are limited to the areas in which they are originated, are the result of allegations of data leakage. Hence, these initiatives can do little to insure the use of sensitive data of students in unknown situations. To ensure continuity and an increase of confidence in the application of Learning Analytics is necessary to bind to legality a new approach to safeguard privacy of students' data in its current and future uses. Considering the above, it is possible to add a technological layer above these policies that ensures its viability. Some emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts are strong candidates to ensure privacy and secure sensible data of students. The use of smart contracts allows the automation of legal actions so that they are executed as soon as irregularities in the use or data collection are detected. In this work, we propose a series of actions to preserve the identity of students and secure their data with emerging technologies such as blockchain.

AB The collection of students' sensible data raises adverse reactions against Learning Analytics that decreases the confidence in its adoption. The laws and policies that surround the use of educational data are not enough to ensure privacy, security, validity, integrity and reliability of students' data. This problem has been detected through literature review and can be solved if a technological layer of automated checking rules is added above these policies. The aim of this thesis is to research about an emerging technology such as blockchain to preserve the identity of students and secure their data. In a first stage a systematic literature review will be conducted in order to set the context of the research. Afterwards, and through the scientific method, we will develop a blockchain based solution to automate rules and constraints with the aim to let students the governance of their data and to ensure data privacy and security.

DE healthcare remedy; crowdsourcing; blockchain; cloud computing
AB We present a healthcare remedy evaluation system, called CORUS, using blockchain-based crowdsourcing on a cloud computing platform. Efficacy of healthcare remedies such as functional foods and dietary supplements usually spreads by subjective word of mouth. Though regular clinical trials could be employed, it requires significant cost in time and budget. We expect crowdsourcing can be an effective and efficient alternative to the costly clinical trials to achieve objective evaluation on healthcare remedies. The blockchain technology can alleviate the problem of information quality in most of crowdsourcing systems. Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability. To our knowledge, CORUS is the first system to utilize crowdsourcing, blockchains, and cloud computing for healthcare remedy evaluation. It is available at https://corus.kaist.edu.

DE service level agreement; cloud computing; smart contract; blockchain
AB Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) is challengeable due to lacking a trustworthy platform. This paper presents a witness model to credibly enforce the cloud service level agreement. Through introducing the witness role and using the blockchain based smart contract, we solve the trust issues about who can detect the service violation, how the violation is confirmed and the compensation is guaranteed. In this model, a verifiable consensus sortition algorithm proposed by us is firstly leveraged to select independent witnesses to form a witness committee. They are responsible for a specific service level agreement and get paid by monitoring and detecting service violation. Through carefully designing the witness' payoff function in the agreement, we further leverage game theory to analyze and prove that it is not the witness itself is trustworthy. Instead, the witness has to tell the truth because of its greedy nature, which is the desire to maximize its own revenue. As long as the service violation is confirmed by the witness committee, the compensation is automatically transferred to the customer by the smart contract. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype with the smart contract of Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the feasibility of our model.

AB This paper presents a blockchain-based architecture for electronic health record (EHR) systems. The architecture is built on top of existing databases maintained by health providers, implements a blockchain solution to improve interoperability of the current EHR systems, prevent tampering and malicious misuse of EHRs by means of tracking all events that happened to the data in the databases. This proposed architecture also introduces a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks in the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions, hence potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against tampering and misuse.

AB Cloud services operate in a highly dynamic environment. This means that they need to be assorted with dynamic SLAs which explicate how a rich set of QoS guarantees evolves over time. Only in this way, cloud users will trust and thus migrate their processes to the cloud. Research-wise, SLAs are assumed to include single states while they are managed mainly in a centralised manner. This paper proposes a framework to manage dynamic SLAs in a distributed manner by relying on a rich and dynamic SLA formalism which is transformed into a smart contract. This contract is then handled via the blockchain which exploits an oracle-based interface to retrieve the off-chain cloud service context sensed and enforce the right SLA management/modification functions. The proposed framework can change the current shape of the cloud market by catering for the notion of an open distributed cloud which offers manageable and dynamic services to cloud customers enabling them to reduce costs and increase the flexibility in resource management.

DE Blockchain; Ethereum; Data integrity; Data validation; Audit trail
AB Data manipulation is often named as a serious threat to data integrity. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Data users in various application domains want to be ensured that the data they are consuming are accurate and have not been tampered with. To validate the integrity of these data, we describe a blockchain-based hash validation method. The method assumes that the actual data is stored separately from the blockchain, and then allows a data identifier and a hash of these data to be submitted to the blockchain. The actual data can be validated against the hash on the blockchain at any time. Several use cases are described for blockchain-based hash validation, and to validate the method it is implemented inside an application audit trail to validate the audit trail data. This implementation shows that blockchain-based hash validation is able to detect malicious and accidental changes that were made to the data.

AB Blockchain technology, on which digital currencies are based, is poised to be the most important disruption business innovation since the Internet. Today researchers and renowned companies have proposed the use of this technology in other areas such as voting, identity management, smart city, and others. Regarding smart city, car navigation systems is one of the main research directions that aims to streamline traffic and calculate travel routes. Existing applications such as Google Traffic or Waze are often used, but for users worried about their personal data, these systems are something of a black box. Using blockchain technology, in this paper we describe the architecture of a car navigation system in which personal data protection is a major concern.

AB NEOM is one of the Saudi Arabia's vision projects to build an intelligent environment where the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key technologies. This technology refers to the interconnection among various devices using the Internet to track, analyze, and process the data during running time. The technology is developing rapidly with extensive attention given to enhancing its security level. Indeed, due to their dependency on a centralized architecture, IoT objects can become vulnerable points and targets for several attacks. Moreover, using the traditional security mechanisms with static measures may be inappropriate to the dynamic nature of the IoT environment. In this study, we will investigate the problem of IoT security issues and what the possibility of employing promising technologies such a BlockChain (BC) to enhance the security aspect of IoT environment, especially on the application layer. The BC is an infrastructure that broadcasts the resources to all participants with consensus verification. This trending technology overrides the drawbacks of central authority and provides a distributed architecture. For these reasons, multiple studies began to utilize the promising BlockChain technology but research in this area is at preliminary stages.

AB Bitcoin-derived blockchain has shown promise as infrastructure for many decentralized models. However, problems are withholding the realization of the potentials. The booming increase of storage demand has hindered devices with storage shortage to use blockchain powered distributed applications. In this paper, we present section-blockchain, a new blockchain protocol, which is designed to solve the oversize storage problem without compromise the security of blockchain. There are no full nodes or lightweight nodes, all nodes are equal and contributing to the Section-Blockchain network. Experiments demonstrate that Section-Blockchain is efficient, remarkably reduced the storage, and withstand sudden nodes losing of massive scale. Section-blockchain also extended the capability of blockchain to the foundation of an autotrophic, tamper-resist decentralized storage system, in which, data can be equidistributional distributed worldwide automatically without any centralized dispatcher to assign storage; nodes are motivated to change their local storage to receive more remuneration. The global storage distribution is continuously optimizing and fit into any adding/losing nodes.

AB Blockchain technology relies on consensus algorithms to resolve conflicts in Byzantine environments. New blockchain algorithms are rapidly designed and implemented without a properly conducted formal analysis and verification. In this paper, we conducted a study on Tendermint which is a proof of-stake consensus algorithm. We verified that the consensus protocol is deadlock-free and is able to reach consensus when at least 2/3 of the network is in agreement. We also proved that a minority set of nodes that compose more than 1/3 of the network is enough to censor the majority of the network and prevent the network from reaching consensus and conclude that the algorithm has some shortcomings on availability.

AB The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system.

AB Trust management has been a topic of keen interest in recent years. There has been a lot of discussion as to what new opportunities it can bring to markets, what benefits it can offer, and what system development possibilities it enables for software development. In this paper we discuss trust management and business critical information sharing in a definite group of stakeholders called Circle of Trust. We examine the key features of the Circle of Trust in military environments. We address the most essential problems and obstacles to be considered before the benefits of Circle of Trust can be fully enabled therein. As a solution to problems with the information transfer management, we propose a novel conceptual approach which ensures the privacy of the data source and transparency of information sharing utilizing the blockchain technology and modern cryptographic solutions. In addition, the concept presented enables the quantitative information trade and objective control mechanism for contractual liabilities within the consortium. The discussion and views presented in this paper can be adopted in any organization with doubts concerning the sensitive and classified contents of supply chain management or current ICT systems.

AB The paper proposes a Machine Learning methodology for Android malware detection and recognition, including crypto-mining applications using the blockchain. The design is based on a hierarchical classification method, with several decision stages. A combination of functional and statistical features is proposed to be applied for data classification in order to provide a high-performance malware recognition process. The specific contribution of this design methodology is the hierarchical classifier with detection and discrimination stages, respectively. Further works should be done for various features sets in order to achieve an optimized and high-accuracy modeling process supporting an innovative Machine Learning-based solution for Android malware detection.

DE inter-domain latency; blockchain; future internet
AB Border gateway protocol (BGP) version 4 is routing current Internet for more than 20 years. BGP is the only protocol that has proven its routing capability of such size network with continually growing nature. Although BGP is scalable and network layer reachability information it lacks quality of service metrics like latency. BGP routing decision algorithm uses as-path length between autonomous systems (AS) as main factor for most of its best-path calculations. Because of more affordable peering architectures as-path length is generally decreasing in worldwide internet network resulting in less efficient routes for real-time internet protocol traffic. This study proposes future internet architecture consisting of multiple AS which provide latency aware routing in software defined network (SDN). For highest reliability there are bilateral latency measurements between each pair of connected autonomous systems. Latency measurement results are stored in distributed decentralized blockchain network where each AS holds its share. Each AS hosts an SDN instance for interconnection with neighbor SDN controllers over AS border. SDN instances processes latency measurement data from blockchain network, validates data integrity and manages latency aware routing for real-time data flows.

AB In recent years, the rapid development of Cloud, Edge and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has accelerated the advancement trends forcing applications and information systems (IS) to evolve. In this new ecosystem, ISs are federated and usually highly distributed becoming complex and very dynamic that have to extend not only through the Cloud/Edge and IoT layers but also the federated organizational boundaries. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) is a new paradigm driven by the significant increase in capacity /capability of resources in highly distributed and federated environments, that solves problems related to the deployment, networking and security of microservices called MicroElements (MEL) that are composed and interconnected over Cloud/Edge and IoT infrastructures with specified levels of QoS and security constraints. In this federated collaborative system, each organization needs to have proper administration and security policies to maintain data security while allowing selective sharing of resources. Classical models of access control are not effective in protecting resources while allowing users to access to the resources within their privileges. Blockchain is an underlying technology that could help organizations to improve access control systems through consensus mechanisms, and underlying features of immutability, transparency, auditability, and cryptography. In this work, we propose a MELs orchestration approach through a Software Defined Membrane (SDMem) that leverages Blockchain facilities obeying the osmosis principles.

AB Every year, traffic collisions have increased rapidly in proportion to the increase in the number of vehicles, especially at intersections. The main cause is human error in recognition and decision-making. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems represent emerging challenges. AVs can take a great deal of different actions when approaching an intersection. Several research centers are developing algorithms to solve one of the crucial aspects of autonomous driving, i.e the intersections management, trying to avoid collisions and traffic congestion. In this context, security is the main concern, due to the high exposure to data and information between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Intersection (V2I) communications. Blockchain and smart contracts, one of most promising technologies emerged in recent years, represent a possible solution for the existing security issues. Smart contracts are the orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and negotiated agreement between the consenting parties participating in the Blockchain network. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent AIM (MA-AIM) system based on V2I/I2V communication to securely manage vehicles crossing though an intersections by leveraging Blockchain facilities. A central Intersection Manager Agent (IMA) is implemented at each intersection while each vehicle is controlled by a Driver Agent (DA).

AB The mF2C project is building an open, secure and decentralized management platform for coordinating resource sharing between connected devices in the fog-to-cloud (F2C) environment. Safeguarding information security and privacy in mF2C is a considerable challenge given the heterogeneous and autonomous nature of devices spanning the F2C spectrum. The recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) raised the stake further by defining stringent security and privacy requirements on the processing of personal information. IaaS and PaaS providers falling in scope must demonstrate that they have implemented reasonable security mechanisms to ensure compliance or face significant financial penalties. In this paper, we present a prototype JAVA-based security library that addresses some of the data security and privacy requirements of mF2C and GDPR. The prototype employs a PKI-based trust model to facilitate authentication and authorization. It uses policy to ensure data privacy and cryptography to deliver data confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. We also outline plans to enhance the mF2C security infrastructure with data protection functionalities from the security library and to leverage blockchain technology to augment mF2C security and data protection capabilities.

DeepLinQ proposes a multi-layer blockchain architecture to improve flexibility, accountability, and scalability through on-demand queries, proxy appointment, subgroup signatures, granular access control, and smart contracts in order to support privacy-preserving distributed data sharing. In this data-driven AI era where big data is the prerequisite for training an effective deep learning model, DeepLinQ provides a trusted infrastructure to enable training data collection in a privacy-preserved way. This paper uses healthcare data sharing as an application example to illustrate the key properties and design of DeepLinQ.

AB Product recalls in the healthcare industry contribute to significant supply chain disruptions. In the absence of a reliable product tracking communicating recall information and to recover or safe disposal of the product is extremely challenging. Healthcare product recalls are more generally classified based on severity of risk to patient life and such a classification often does not help supply chain community to assess the impact of recalls and develop alternative sourcing strategies. Hence there is critical need to assess and review healthcare product recalls with an emphasis on supply chain and logistics. In this paper we review the extant literature to identify and categorize factors that often lead to product recalls, and propose a potential approach to enable effective product tracking and recall communication using blockchain technology. The resulting information can aid research and practice community to develop suitable frameworks, models and strategies to mitigate product recalls.

AB Supply Chain Financing (SCF) provides the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with special access to loan based on supply chain, dragging numerous enterprises out of financing dilemma. At the same time, banks also have to face with risks coming with SCF. This paper mainly explores SCF pledge risk controlling taking advantage of block chain technology, which is known for information transparency and tamper proof, and proposes a strategy of Real Time Stare in Market (RTSM) to mitigate risk pressure brought by pledge of movables. Once the total value of pledge drops below the level of safety, replenishment is required. Numerical experiments results show that banks can avoid risk of pledge and even gain more from RTSM strategy.

AB Most of the cyber information systems require users to provide identity information as a way of authentication and usually the identity information is a pair of username and password. With so many information systems to access, people need to memorize hundreds of usernames and passwords. As a result, they often forget their usernames or passwords and have to go through a time-consuming and troublesome procedure to find them back. In this article, we propose a solution storing people's usernames and passwords using block-chain in an encrypted format. When the username or password for a particular website is lost, they can be accessible through the block-chain. As a result, people do not need to memorize their usernames and passwords for different websites anymore. The password stored in the block-chain would not be compromised to any cyber-attacks because block-chain is immutable.

AB Cryptocurrency is a rapid developing financial technology innovation which has attracted a large number of people around the world. The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have triggered panic and chain reactions towards the application and adoption of cryptocurrency and have caused public security related events. So far, a lot of researches and analyses have focused on just one or only a few number of cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive analysis of the whole cryptocurrency market and its systemic risk is still lacking. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and systemic risk of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history. We first validated that the correlation matrix and asset tree are good tools to analyze the risk and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, consistent with public perception, our quantitative analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable. Our work is the first to investigate the systemic risk of the whole cryptocurrency market and may shed some light on cryptocurrency related investment decision, regulation, and legislation.

AB Nowadays, numerous applications of smart home systems provide recommendations for users, including reducing their energy consumption, warnings of defective devices, selecting reliable devices and software, diagnoses, etc [1]. The internet connected, dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the smart home environment creates new security, authentication, and privacy challenges [2]. To solve those challenges, an approach to data privacy in smart home using blockchain technology, which is called smart home based the IoT-Blockchain (SHIB), is proposed in this paper. In order to demonstrate the proposed architecture, an experimental scenario using Ganache, Remix, and web3.js is built among the user, service provider, and smart home to evaluate the performance of the smart contract in the SHIB. Based on the experiment results, the SHIB architecture brings the advantages like data privacy, trust access control, and high extension ability. In addition, the comparison between the proposed architecture and existing models in different parameters such as smart contract, the privacy of data, usage of tokens, updating the policies, and misbehavior judging are performed.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a popular concept that has begun to take its place in our lives today with the growth and development of smart devices. With the spread of such technologies, it is inevitable that some security problems will arise. In terms of IoT systems, the communication of devices, the management of connections, the storage of distributed data, the authentication and authorization procedures on devices emerge significant security risks. In this study, a new approach based on blockchain for user access management problem of IoT environments is proposed in the light of current literature, considering the application level security vulnerabilities in IoT devices. In this context, blockchain technology for user access management and Keycloak which provides single sign-on infrastructure for authentication and session management uses in IoT devices.

AB Bitcoin has introduced a new concept that could feasibly revolutionise the entire Internet as it exists, and positively impact on many types of industries including, but not limited to, banking, public sector and supply chain. This innovation is grounded on pseudo-anonymity and strives on its innovative decentralised architecture based on the blockchain technology. Blockchain is pushing forward a race of transaction-based applications with trust establishment without the need for a centralised authority, promoting accountability and transparency within the business process. However, a blockchain ledger (e.g., Bitcoin) tend to become very complex and specialised tools, collectively called "Blockchain Analytics", are required to allow individuals, law enforcement agencies and service providers to search, explore and visualise it. Over the last years, several analytical tools have been developed with capabilities that allow, e.g., to map relationships, examine flow of transactions and filter crime instances as a way to enhance forensic investigations. This paper discusses the current state of blockchain analytical tools and presents a thematic taxonomy model based on their applications. It also examines open challenges for future development and research.

AB Mining congestion is a serious issue in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. It increases the transaction confirmation latency and limits the growth of cryptocurrency. To mitigate the problem, a number of methods have been used in practice and new ideas have been proposed. However, it is not clear whether these schemes can cope with the ever-growing transaction load of cryptocurrencies in the long run. We propose a novel parallel mining method that can adjust the mining capacity based on the transaction load. It does not require an increase in the block size or a reduction of the block confirmation period. In this paper, we describe how and when to divide or merge blockchains, how to solve the imbalanced mining problem, and how to handle the difficulty levels and rewards. We then show the simulation results comparing the performance of Binary blockchain and the traditional blockchain.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.

   globalization; bitcoin; blockchain; dialogue
AB In the year that George Ritzer publishes the ninth edition of The McDonaldization of Society, moving his famous theory firmly Into the Digital Age, critical educator Petar Jandric and sociologist Sarah Hayes invited George to a dialogue on the digital transformation of McDonaldization and its critical application to Higher Education. In this article, George first traces for us the origins of his theory that has endured for four decades. A key dimension of McDonaldization is the 'iron cage' of control, via rationalization. Once contained within physical sites of bricks and mortar, now, we encounter a 'velvet cage' in sites of digital consumption, at the hands of non-human technologies, that threaten human labor and autonomy. Whilst the concept of the McUniversity is not without some critique, this interview provides compelling reasons to open new dialogue about McDonaldization in augmented settings such as Higher Education. With the rise of prosuming machines such as blockchain and bitcoin, that can both produce and consume without intervention from human 'prosumers', universities cannot afford to ignore the challenges of prosumer capitalism, which George concludes, will explode into unprecedented and unpredictable directions in the years to come.

AB Recently, blockchain has been foreseen by industry and research community as a transformational and disruptive technology that is poised to play a major role in transforming the way we transact, trade, bank, track and register assets, and do business. Blockchain can potentially be used to provide trusted authenticity, origin, and ownership for IoT devices, in a way that is secure and decentralized without the involvement of a Trusted Third Parties (TTP) or centralized authorities and services. A TTP can be a subject to a single point of failure, and it can be disrupted, compromised or hacked. A TTP can potentially misbehave and become corrupt in the future, even if it is trustworthy now. This paper shows how Ethereum blockchain (with the powerful feature of programmability through smart contracts) can provide a trusted ownership management for medical IoT (MIoT) devices. Tracking the true ownership of MIoT devices is of a paramount importance as using counterfeited MIoT devices can be life-threatening to patients. The paper presents a general framework and solution to manage and trace back the true origin of ownership for an MIoT; whereby an MIoT device can be owned by multiple parties during its life cycle. The paper presents a detailed overview of our proposed system architecture, design, entity relationship, and interactions among all involved parties. The source code of the Ethereum smart contracts is made publicly available. Key aspects related to the algorithms, interactions, implementation and testing are discussed in the paper. Furthermore, we provide security analysis of our proposed solution in terms of satisfying the general security goals and also resiliency against popular attacks as those of DDoS, eavesdropping and replay attacks.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger and the underlying technology of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, allowing it to operate in a decentralized fashion with no intermediaries such as financial institutions. The use of blockchain, however, will be far beyond the financial sector; smart contracts, for example would allow business and legal agreements to be stored and executed online. It is anticipated that blockchain will do to middle-and back-office functions what the Internet and the Web have done to the front-office -automate functions. In this paper, we investigate what Chief Information Officers (CIOs) think of blockchain and how they plan to utilize it for their organizations. We conducted a survey that was completed by 25 CIOs in the United Arab Emirates and found mixed feelings about the technology and barriers for use. In this paper, we also discuss opportunities and challenges in adopting blockchain.

AB An increasing number of people, organizations and corporations are expressing their interest in the decentralization technology of the blockchain. The creation of the blockchain marks the time when we start building distributed peer-to-peer networks consisting of non-trusting members that interact with each other without a trusted intermediary but in a verifiable manner. In this paper, we propose a decentralized application (DApp) based on blockchain technology for sharing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors' data, and demonstrate various challenges addressed during the development process. This application combines blockchain technology with IoT and operates through smart contracts that are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. More specifically the application is a platform for sharing (buying and selling) measurements of IoT weather sensors and operates on the Ethereum blockchain, acting as a marketplace for IoT sensor data. This application applies the Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) business model combined with blockchain.

AB (1)Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting, warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized, open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them timely.

AB The increasing demand for mobile network capacity driven by Internet of Things (IoT) applications results in the need for understanding better the potential and limitations of 5G networks. Vertical application areas like smart mobility, energy networks, industrial IoT applications, and AR/VR enhanced services all pose different requirements on the use of 5G networks. Some applications need low latency, whereas others need high bandwidth or security support. The goal of this paper is to identify the requirements and to understand the limitations for 5G driven applications. We review application areas and list the typical challenges and requirements posed on 5G networks. A main challenge will be to develop a network architecture being able to dynamically adapt to fluctuating traffic patterns and accommodating various technologies such as edge computing, blockchain based distributed ledger, software defined networking, and virtualization. To inspire future research, we reveal open problems and highlight the need for piloting with 5G applications, with tangible steps, to understand the configuration of 5G networks and the use of applications across multiple vertical industries.

AB There are changing dynamics among political regionalization processes and the rescaling of nation-states in Europe. However, updated and timely research remains scant, ambiguous and unable to meet the challenges of data-driven societies and uneven borders. Nations' physical boundaries matter as much as political borders in their pervasive and growing algorithmic, stateless, liquid and metropolitan citizenship patterns. This paper explores these new 'connectographies' from a regional science perspective, introducing the term 'algorithmic nations' as a city-regional and techno-political conceptual assemblage. A case study is presented of the small stateless city-regionalized European nation of the Basque Country through its analytical and transitional lens, locally known as 'Euskal Hiria' (Basque city-region in the Basque language). This paper questions whether the Basque Country could evolve by (1) modifying its governmental logics and (2) merging its three separate devolved administrations (3) while enabling their direct interactions with citizens (4) through blockchain technologies as the small state of Estonia is implementing and employing cutting-edge algorithmic governance frameworks. In doing so, this paper suggests how four drivers - metropolitanization, devolution, the right to decide and blockchain - may be respectively invigorating four dynamics - geoeconomics, geopolitics, geodemocratics and geotechnologics - in this transition towards the algorithmic nations. Ultimately, this paper concludes with an algorithmic nations research and policy agenda decalogue of how these geotechnological changes might determine the future position of small stateless city-regionalized nations in the European Union.

AB In the past few years, cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications has been one of the most rapidly emerging fields of computer science, leading to a strong demand of software applications. Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US$), Bitfinex in 2016 (72 million US$), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.

AB Smart contracts that build up on blockchain technologies are receiving great attention in new business applications and the scientific community, because they allow untrusted parties to manifest contract terms in program code and thus eliminate the need for a trusted third party. The creation process of writing well performing and secure contracts in Ethereum, which is today's most prominent smart contract platform, is a difficult task. Research on this topic has only recently started in industry and science. Based on an analysis of collected data with Grounded Theory techniques, we have elaborated several common security patterns, which we describe in detail on the basis of Solidity, the dominating programming language for Ethereum. The presented patterns describe solutions to typical security issues and can be applied by Solidity developers to mitigate typical attack scenarios.

DE Blockchain; Inspecting; Solidity; Smart Contracts
AB Solidity is a language used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are embedded procedures stored with the data they act upon. Debugging smart contracts is a really difficult task since once deployed, the code cannot be re-executed and inspecting a simple attribute is not easily possible because data is encoded. In this paper, we address the lack of inspectability of a deployed contract by analyzing contract state using decompilation techniques driven by the contract structure definition. Our solution, SmartInspect, also uses a mirror-based architecture to represent locally object responsible for the interpretation of the contract state. SmartInspect allows contract developers to better visualize and understand the contract stored state without needing to redeploy, nor develop any ad-hoc code.

DE smart contracts; blockchain; software engineering
AB Smart Contracts have gained tremendous popularity in the past few years, to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. However, since the release of the Frontier network of Ethereum in 2015, there have been many cases in which the execution of Smart Contracts managing Ether coins has led to problems or conflicts. Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software.
   In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains. We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps "unsafe" programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017). In this study we analyze the source code of Parity and the library, and discuss how recognised best practices could mitigate, if adopted and adapted, such detrimental software misbehavior. We also reflect on the specificity of Smart Contract software development, which makes some of the existing approaches insufficient, and call for the definition of a specific Blockchain Software Engineering.

DE ICO; Initial Coin Offering; cryptocurrencies; Ethereum; Smart Contracts
AB Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are public offers of new cryptocurrencies in exchange of existing ones, aimed to finance projects in the blockchain development arena. In the last 8 months of 2017, the total amount gathered by ICOs exceeded 4 billion US$, and overcame the venture capital funnelled toward high tech initiatives in the same period. A high percentage of ICOs is managed through Smart Contracts running on Ethereum blockchain, and in particular to ERC-20 Token Standard Contract. In this work we examine 1387 ICOs, published on December 31, 2017 on icobench.com website, gathering information relevant to the assessment of their quality and software development management, including data on their development teams. We also study, at the same date, the financial data of 450 ICO tokens available on coinmarketcap.com website, among which 355 tokens are managed on Ethereum blochain. We define success criteria for the ICOs, based on the funds actually gathered, and on the behavior of the price of the related tokens, finding the factors that most likely influence the ICO success likeliness.

   evaluation; Information Richness; Evaluation Transparency
AB Initial Cryptoasset Offering (ICO), also often called Initial Coin Offering or Initial Token Offering (ITO) is a new means of fundraising through blockchain technology, which allows startups to raise large amounts of funds from the crowd in an unprecedented speed. However it is not easy for ordinary investors to distinguish genuine fundraising activities through ICOs from scams. Different websites that gather and evaluate ICOs at different stages have emerged as a solution to this issue. What remains unclear is how these websites are evaluating ICOs, and consequently how reliable and credible their evaluations are. In this paper we present the first findings of an analysis of a set of 28 ICO evaluation websites, aiming at revealing the state of the practice in terms of ICO evaluation. Key information about ICOs collected by these websites are categorised, and key factors that differentiate the evaluation mechanisms employed by these evaluation websites are identified. The findings of our study could help a better understanding of what entails to properly evaluate ICOs. It is also a first step towards discovering the key success factors of ICOs.

AB Inspired by the success of Bitcoin, many clients for the Bitcoin protocol as well as for alternative blockchain protocols have been implemented. However, implementations may contain errors, and the cost of an error in the case of a cryptocurrency can be extremely high.
   We propose to tackle this problem with a suite of abstract property tests that check whether a blockchain system satisfies laws that most blockchain and blockchain-like systems should satisfy. To test a new blockchain system, its developers need to instantiate generators of random objects to be used by the tests. The test suite then checks the satisfaction of the laws over many random cases. We provide examples of laws in the paper.

AB Recent theoretical attacks conjectured the vulnerabilities of mainstream blockchains through simulations or assumption violations. Unfortunately, previous results typically omit both the nature of the network under which the blockchain code runs and whether blockchains are private, consortium or public.
   In this paper, we study the public Ethereum blockchain as well as a consortium and private blockchains and quantify the feasibility of man-in-the-middle and double spending attacks against them. To this end, we list important properties of the Ethereum public blockchain topology, we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum to mimic the top-10 mining pools of Ethereum and we attack them, by first partitionning the network through BGP hijacking or ARP spoofing before issuing a Balance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate that attacking Ethereum is remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context as the adversary can multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through BGP hijacking whereas it would be almost impossible in a public context.

AB In recent years, the interest in blockchain has grown exponentially, and nowadays it is foreseen as a technology with the potential to revolutionize the way data is maintained and transferred around the globe. The reason of this excitement is ascribable to the ability of enabling new forms of transactions and interactions between mistrusting and decentralized entities. Indeed, it has attracted interests and huge investments from enterprises, and it is predictable that in a near future many industries will adopt it. However, it is not a panacea and in some cases may even become useless or not convenient. Moreover, even when it can really constitute an added value, selecting the proper blockchain and configuring it may not be trivial. Trying to go beyond the hype and to address this problem, this paper proposes a methodology addressing: i) whether, given a specific problem requirements, the blockchain is a proper solution for it ii) in such a case which is the blockchain category more suitable, and finally iii) guiding the designer throughout its configuration.

AB In the age of Big Data, releasing protected sensitive data at a future point in time is critical for various applications. Such self-emerging data release requires the data to be protected until a prescribed data release time and be automatically released to the recipient at the release time, even if the data sender goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for supporting self-emerging data using smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain networks. We design a credible and enforceable smart contract for supporting self-emerging data release. The smart contract employs a set of Ethereum peers to jointly follow the proposed timed-release service protocol allowing the participating peers to earn the remuneration paid by the service users. We model the problem as an extensive-form game with imperfect information to protect against possible adversarial attacks including some peers destroying the private data (drop attack) or secretly releasing the private data before the release time (release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the efficacy and attack-resilience of the proposed techniques through rigorous analysis and experimental evaluation. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrate the low monetary cost and the low time overhead associated with the proposed approach and validate its guaranteed security properties.

AB The phases those turn the wheels of an autonomous vehicle, are perception, decision and actuation. Among these, the major highlight of recent research has been perception through diverse sensors, and decision through an ever-aggressive cloud/fog/mist computing setup. In this paper, we take a closer look into the flow of data, both internal and external to the autonomous vehicle. We argue that confidentiality, integrity and availability of these data are critical to the eventual adoption of higher-level security and privacy mechanisms in autonomous vehicles. To that effect, we propose a secure and tamper-resilient distributed ledger as an underlying enabler for intra-vehicular data aggregation, and study its security and privacy issues under appropriate adversarial models, where the distributed ledger is instantiated as a standard consortium blockchain.

DE Blockchain transaction; Unspent Transaction Ouput; transaction size;
   UTXOs pool; mathematical modeling
AB In this paper, we propose novel mathematical models for effectively choosing a set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in transaction-based blockchains in terms of two major objectives. The first one is to minimize the transaction size, as a result, minimize the transaction fee for miners paid by users. The second one is to shrink the UTXO set size that consequently reduces the searching space and computation overhead. Our proposed models are evaluated on real transactions collected from Bitcoin network and transactions generated by Highest Value First (HVF) and Lowest Value First (LVF) based approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed models gain better performance compared to other existing approaches.

AB This paper introduces some trust issues for blockchain transactions. Such transactions rely on ECDSA signature based on 32 bytes secret keys. Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature.

AB System Wide Information Management (SWIM) including SWIM Registry for Air Traffic Management (ATM) has been successfully developed and applied in Europe and United States. The most developing countries have just started to study the employment of SWIM concept, which its establishment is required prior to the development of SWIM Registry. In this paper, we introduce the experience of the development of SWIM Registry Brazil, which comprises the study of the architecture, components, services and data accessing. In order to encourage consumers and providers to participate in the SWIM community, we developed a prototype of SWIM Registry Demonstration for the Brazilian ATM society. We propose a model based on Blockchain for managing services currently provided by Brazilian ATM in order to certificate operations which are performed by consumers, authorities and involved stakeholders. The proposed model is expected to provide services for SWIM Registry with integrity, efficiency, security and authenticity, which are fundamental for the proper operation of Brazilian aviation system.

DE Microgrid energy trade; Blockchain; Double auction
AB In this paper we use the blockchain technology to develop a peer to peer energy trade platform without a trusted third party. Our main contribution is a novel distributed double auction mechanism which allows any peer to act as an auctioneer and the blockchain mechanism ensures that a peer behaves lawfully while acting as an auctioneer. Using experimental evaluation we show that (1) the distributed auction converges quickly, (2) it minimizes energy loss due to long transmission, (3) computational overhead due to employing a blockchain is negligible, (4) it is efficient and (5) it can implement trade restrictions imposed by the energy distribution network.

AB IoT data economy is an emerging concept since sensing data are widely applied in various IoT services. To maintain the stability of data economic system, this paper proposes the Reliable IoT Data Economic System (RIDES) to provide IoT data a reliable, automatic, and intelligent trading environment. Applying the smart contract technique, IoT data in RIDES can be automatically traded without human intervention. As the trading procedure is performed based on blockchain, all transactions can be protected against tampering. Also, the RIDES provides the Smart Decision Making Module for users to develop practical pricing strategies. Thus, a seller can derive a price with the highest expected revenue for its data and a buyer can purchase its desired data referring to cost-performance ratio or data owner's trustworthiness. Even if malicious sellers cheat buyers, the latter can invoke trade dispute procedure to refund their payment, which makes the trading environment more reliable. As the blockchain-based operations usually cost much, the RIDES adopts the edge computing architecture to alleviate the burdens of IoT devices. Finally, the RIDES is implemented in IoT environments. The case study demonstrates that the transactions on IoT data can be performed correctly by RIDES.

AB Ethereum is a public (permissionless) blockchain with a Turing complete execution machine for smart contracts. Miners that execute a smart contract receive a fee determined by the gas associated with the operation codes (opcodes) in the smart contract. It is important that the gas award is proportional to the computation resources required, to assure that incentives are aligned and denial of service attacks are avoided. Currently, the amount of gas awarded is set statically for each opcode, but it is unknown if these values are correct for various computer architectures. Therefore, we propose in this paper a benchmark approach to assess the computational resources required per opcode. We apply the benchmark approach to PC and MAC as a first illustration of the approach.

AB These days, IoT devices are deployed at a massive scale, with Cisco predicting 20 billion devices by the year 2020. As opposed to endpoint devices, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, incapable of securing and defending themselves, and can be easily hacked and compromised. Fog computing can augment such capacity limitations by providing localized compute, storage, and networking for a group of IoT devices. As fog nodes are deployed in close proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can be more effective than cloud computing. Furthermore, Blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure management, authentication and access to IoT devices and their data, in decentralized manner with high trust, integrity, and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a user authentication scheme using blockhain-enabled fog nodes in which fog nodes interface to Ethereum smart contracts to authenticate users to access IoT devices. The fog nodes are used to provide scalability to the system by relieving the IoT devices from carrying out heavy computation involving tasks related to authentication and communicating with the blockchain. We describe system components, architecture and design, and we discuss key aspects related to security analysis, functionality, testing and implementation of the smart contracts. The full code of the smart contracts for authentication registry, lists, rules and logic is also made publicly available at Github.

AB The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the de facto standard for communication inside the vehicle between its Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the various sensors that are distributed throughout the body and powertrain of the vehicle. To date, the bus remains unprotected from network attacks, a situation that cannot persist, given the recent drive toward vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), which leaves a vehicle's electronic devices exposed to all sorts of network attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight encryption solution, reminiscent of Blockchain technology, that generates keys based on a CAN frame's payload and the previous key, thus rendering a robust solution. We describe our solution's design and its prototypical implementation, which we built to verify the functionality of our solution. We also validate our solution using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool.

AB In this paper, we consider blockchain technology that enabled the existence of digital currency and we investigate Bitcoin cryptocurrency application. This technology nowadays represents a new feature that replaces existing client-server core system on top of some distributed systems with many additional features such as high availability, resistance to alteration, fault tolerance and cost reduction. After overviewing how such technology is working, we highlightthe requirements and benefits related to the security, database and network. We mainly focus on answering the most Bitcoin queries including privacy and double spending. Furthermore, as blockchain has potential applications far beyond bitcoin, we draw future insights where applications based blockchain are provisioned in the market in order to be totally or partially independent of the centralized systems and we provide a questionnaire helping organizations for better using the blockchain feasibilities.

AB In centralized environments, the results of voting events have always been questionable and perceived differently by voters. Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results. In this paper we propose a novel approach for a decentralized trustless voting platform that relies on Blockchain technology to solve the trust issues. The main features of this system include ensuring data integrity and transparency, and enforcing one vote per mobile phone number for every poll with ensured privacy. To accomplish this, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is used as the Blockchain runtime environment, on which transparent, consistent and deterministic smart contracts will be deployed by organizers for each voting event to run the voting rules. Users are authenticated through their mobile phone numbers without the need of a third party server. Results showed that the system is feasible and may offer a step towards ideal environments for such experience.

AB Mobile network operators can expand their capacity by aggregating their licensed spectrum with the spectrum discovered opportunistically, i.e., spatiotemporally unused spectrum by other primary users. For an accurate identification of the spectral opportunities, the mobile network has to deploy multiple sensors or it can offload this task to nearby nodes with sensing capabilities, so called helpers. Unfortunately, incentives are limited for helpers to perform energy-wasteful spectrum sensing. Instead, we envision spectrum sensing as a service (Spass) 1 in which a smart contract running on a blockchain (BC) describes the required sensing service parameters and the contracted helpers receive payments only if they perform sensing accurately as agreed in the contract. In this paper, we first introduce Spass and derive a closed formula defining the profitability of a Spass-based business as a function of the spectral efficiency, cost of helpers, and cost of the service. Moreover, we propose two-threshold based voting (TTBV) algorithm to ensure that the fraudulent helpers are excluded from Spass. Via numerical analysis, we show that TTBV causes almost zero false alarms and can exclude malicious users from the contract after only a few iterations. Finally, we develop a running prototype of Spass on Ethereum BC and share the related source code on a publicly-available repository.

AB The increased penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) on the distribution network creates local challenges in balancing consumption and generation. To coordinate the roll-out and the operation of DERs, distribution-level energy markets have been proposed, but there are currently few tools for simulating the operation of DERs in these proposed markets. We present a framework which utilizes a grid co-simulation platform (Mosaik) to simulation DER operation, while simulating market clearing operations with a blockchain network (Ethereum). The use of blockchains, an emerging technology for decentralized computing and data storage, allows us to model secure decentralized execution of market clearing functions and payment processes. By unifying simulation of market clearing rules and the physical grid, we are able to ensure that economic incentives are aligned with physical constraints, helping facilitate the development of more effective distributed energy markets. We demonstrate the use of this new simulation platform on a small feeder, for which a market mechanism to incentivize DER integration is explored.

AB This study investigates the decision problem that Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) encounter for growing their project portfolios whilst seeking financial investors. Global investment in energy efficiency expanded in 2016 at 9%, despite low energy prices, with most of those investments in buildings, which account for one-third of total energy demand. Nevertheless new ways for raising equity and debt, are needed to enable developers to access into larger financing pools, especially for funding retrofitting assets and small-scale energy efficiency projects. We provide an analysis of portfolio generation using digital data system architectures implemented with Blockchain technology as transaction mechanism.

   Market; Aggregator; Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)
AB Inspired by the online peer-to-peer (P2P) goods trading that has become increasingly popular in the recent years, in this paper we propose a decentralized P2P electricity marketing mechanism for a microgrid (MG) consisting of networked prosumer (consumers with distributed generation capability) clusters by incorporating Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts (SC). Our proposed electricity marketing mechanism is a two-level hierarchical one: In the upper level, the aggregators (AGGs) cooperate with each other and in the lower level, the local PRs maximize their financial profits via P2P energy trading. This mechanisms potentially results in price of anarchy instances in which the targets of the two level players will be contradictory. To address this issue, we assume that there exists a single universal cost function for both levels of the game. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed P2P electricity marketing mechanism in maximizing the self-sufficiency of the microgrid and minimizing the side effects of the discriminatory pricing.

AB This paper proposed a decentralized electricity transactions mode of microgrid based on blockchain and continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. The buyer and seller shall first complete the transaction matching in CDA market. Considering the frequent price fluctuation in CDA market, this paper proposed the adaptive aggressiveness strategy, which enables the trader to adjust the quotation timely according to the market changes. Then DG and consumer exchange digital certificate of power and expenditure on the blockchain system, and the consumers' interests are guaranteed by multi-signature when DG cannot generate power due to failure or other reasons. Digital certification of electricity assets is replaced by the sequence number with specific tags in the transaction script, and the size of digital certification can be adjusted according to transaction energy quantity. Finally, the feasibility of proposed mode through a microgrid case and settlement process is given.

AB Crowdsourcing relies on people's contributions to meet product-or system-level objectives. Crowdsourcing-based methods have been implemented in various cyber-physical systems and realtime markets. This paper explores a framework for Crowdsourced Energy Systems (CES), where small-scale energy generation or energy trading is crowdsourced from distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and shapable loads. The merits/ pillars of energy crowdsourcing are discussed. Then, an operational model for CESs in distribution networks with different types of crowdsourcees is proposed. The model yields a market equilibrium depicting traditional and distributed generator and load setpoints. Given these setpoints, crowdsourcing incentives are designed to steer crowdsourcees to the equilibrium. As the number of crowdsourcees and energy trading transactions scales up, a secure energy trading platform is required. To that end, the presented framework is integrated with a lightweight Blockchain implementation and smart contracts. Numerical tests are provided to showcase the overall implementation.

AB Nowadays, the development of the Internet of Things is growing rapidly. This condition raises security problems because of the many violations of security policies. In addition, the development of blockchain is also growing rapidly since it was first popularized in Bitcoin. Security issues on this IoT can be solved using blockchain. One way that can be done is to make secure communication between IoT devices. In this study, an IoT system will be created without and using blockchain which will then be compared between the two. The communication protocol used in IoT systems without blockchain is MQTT. Meanwhile, the blockchain platform used is Ethereum along with a smart contract. Both of these IoT systems will be analyzed for their security level by simulating attacks and observing their security aspects. The test results show that the IoT system based on blockchain technology has a higher level of security than the IoT system without blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain is a distributed database that has advantage of being irreversible, transparent and decentralized. However, beside of its advantages, blockchain still face several challenges, one of them is scalability. One of the scalability challenges is increasing block size for every new transaction. The size of blockchain reached more than 180 GB. The block size will burden the node in conducting transaction verification. To overcome this problem, this paper has an objective to make summary blocks and compression for the summary blocks so that it can increase the space saving of blockchain and make it easier for nodes to verify transactions. The proposed method used for transactions whose entities can be transferred. This method combines block summarization algorithm and deflate compression algorithm. The proposed method applied to Bitcoin blockchain. Space saving is calculated by comparing the total size of original block with the total size of block that has been summarized and the total size of summary block which has been compressed. From the experiment results, the value of space saving for summary blocks is 22.318% and space saving for summary blocks that have been compressed is 78.104%.

AB Blockchain technology has gained immense popularity because many researchers believe that it could solve numerous problems and could be applied in various fields of study. Unfortunately, behind its potentials, blockchain also possessed many challenges and limitations. The highlighted problem is the usability aspect of blockchain technology examined from developer and user perspective. This paper tried to address this problem by proposing query functionalities, with the help of query layer system, to facilitate the developer and the user to access blockchain data easily. There are three main query functionalities that will be discussed in this paper: (1) finding blockchain data based on multiple search parameters (retrieval query), (2) providing simple statistical analysis from a collection of blockchain data (aggregate query) and (3) sorting blockchain data according to its blockchain component (ranking query). For the implementation stage, Ethereum is used as platform to provide blockchain network, MongoDB is used as cloud storage service and REST API is used as web services. For the testing stage, throughput and time response are used to evaluate the performance of the developed query functionalities in the query layer system. The results are: (1) the throughput of query layer system is lower than Ethereum service for blockchain data retrieval and (2) the time response of query layer system is affected by the number of thread and the amount of data stored in cloud storage.

AB In this fast pacing world of modernisation, people are moving ahead at the expense of affecting the society cataclysmically and making the people more standoffish and aloof. Some people are becoming too competitive to earn money while others have no clue how about getting even a penny. But at the same time, there exist people who wish to contribute to the society out of altruism. But the existing centralised systems and brokers for charities are so corrupt that people lose belief in these trustless systems and hence the charities become futile. What if we can use the rapacious ideology of money minded people coupled with the modern technology to make the charity system more effective and trustful. Using an approach of decentralisation, cryptocurrency and finance for donations, the system of charity can be improved to a great extent with the added advantage of the involvement of even these people in a conducive way. We propose a system, backed by cryptocurrency transactions, to make the system of charity more transparent and trustworthy where the charity (in form of work) by individuals or organizations is done first and then that work can be sold later as a stock (here we call it a certificate). This will work in a manner similar to the exchange market using crypto-currency. So, people can raise money out of it, just like stocks but finally the money would go to the charities, as the certificates can only be generated by the charity doers. The complete system will be decentralised using Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts([2]) and Cryptocurrency. This system would facilitate any individual to contribute independently to the society using his time and abilities apart from just money, and ultimately this will lead to an increase in hands towards the amelioration of the society

DE Authorship contribution; blockchain; history preservation
AB Authorship contribution is often taken for granted. Internally, the contribution rate is usually known among all the authors of a given paper. However, this rate is hard to be verified by external parties, as the measurement of the authors' contribution is still not common and the way to measure it is unclear. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based framework to assess the contribution of all authors of any scientific paper. Our framework can be implemented by anyone who is directly or indirectly involved in the publication of the paper, such as a principal researcher, grant funder, research assistant or anyone from relevant external bodies.

AB A major consequence of the Internet era is the emergence of complex "platforms" that combine technology and process in new ways that often disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries. These platforms allow easy participation that often strengthens and extends network effects, while at the same time the vast amounts of data captured through such participation can increase the value of the platform to its participants, creating a virtuous cycle. While initially slow to penetrate the financial services sector, such platforms are now beginning to emerge. We provide a taxonomy of platforms in finance and identify the feasible strategies that are available to incumbents in the industry, innovators, and the major Internet giants.

AB Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are recently gaining wide adoption since the introduction of Bitcoin, being distributed, authority-free, and secure. Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless", and the used intensive computations are considered "waste" of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something" alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work" remained far from being really "useful". In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational" solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.

   Self-Tallying
AB A trusted electronic election system requires that all the involved information must go public. However, it focuses not only on transparency but also on privacy issues. In other words, each ballot should be counted anonymously, correctly, and efficiently. In this work, an effective e-voting system is proposed for voters to minimize their trust in the authority or government. We ensure the transparency of election by putting all messages on the Ethereum blockchain; in the meantime, the privacy of individual voter is protected via an effective ring signature mechanism. Besides, the attractive self-tallying feature is also built in our system, which guarantees that everyone who can access the blockchain network is able to tally the result on his own, i.e., no third party is required after the voting phase. More importantly, we ensure the correctness of voting results and keep the Ethereum gas cost of individual participant as low as possible, at the same time. Moreover, the pre-described characteristics of stealth address in our system makes it more suitable for large-scale election on line.

AB We discuss the issue of what we call incentive mismatch, a fundamental problem with public blockchains supported by economic incentives. This is an open problem, but one potential solution is to make application portable. Portability is desirable for applications on private blockchains. Then, we present examples of middleware designs that enable application portability and, in particular, support migration between blockchains.

AB Designing blockchain architecture is still an open question and encounters a lot of challenges such as scalability, security, high utilization and so on. In this paper, we propose Chameleon, a scalable and adaptive permissioned blockchain architecture. We adopt the principles of non-forking, high security, scalable and high utilization to design the Chameleon to be suitable for next generation blockchain architecture. In Chameleon, we introduce credit value which can only he acquired through honest behavior to enhance the security of the consensus algorithm. We also introduce the QoS of transactions to meet the various needs of different users. While previous work using sharding to improve the scalability, they either store all transactions in every area or just work independently, it either causes too much redundant data or low resource utilization. Combined with the cloud storage, Chameleon partition the nodes into different area according to different scenario, every area process their own transactions and can also cooperate with each other dynamically to improve transaction throughput and resource utilization.

AB The recent explosion of interest in blockchain led to a plethora of researches on consensus algorithms. Compared with hitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more applicable for consortium blockchain. However, these algorithms work lies in the foundation that 3f + 1 nodes are required to tolerate only f faults, which results in high network traffic and cost. The hybrid fault model with Trusted Components (TC) assistance is proposed to reduce the minimum to 2f +1 and improve overall performance. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principles of BFT algorithms based on the hybrid fault model. Then we analyze different TC abstractions and implementation scenarios, and express our own choices. The general framework for BFT algorithms design choices and the applications of this model in blockchain are also discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide guidance for reasonable design of efficient BFT algorithms and application of TC assistance mechanism.

DE blockchain; NDN; key management; trust; signature
AB Named Data Networking is built with security which requires each named Data object to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, the NDN project has proposed a key management model on NDN testbed for verification of the Data packet to be immune to distributing poisoned content. However, in practice, this model poses two challenges for verifying fake content: (1) the centralized architecture easily leads to a single point of failure, especially when the root key fails, its difficult to verify the keys across sites due to the lack of trust between them, and (2) excessive overhead of certificate chain traversal when verifying signature. This paper first proposes a blockchain-based key management scheme in NDN to address the problem of lack of mutual trust between sites without trust anchors. Specifically, all site nodes form a permissioned blockchain for storing public key hashes to ensure the authenticity, and the proxy gateway participates in verifying to reduce excessively frequent communication between the router and the blockchain. In addition, the NDN public key content object and the scheme of their storage, verification, and revocation are redesigned. The result of our analysis and evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is capable of supporting less verification numbers and higher verification efficiency.

AB Blockchain technology is ushering in another break-out year, the challenge of blockchain still remains to be solved. This paper analyzes the features of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-NG system based on blockchian, proposes an improved method of implementing blockchain systems by replacing the structure of the original chain with the graph data structure. It was named GraphChain. Each block represents a transaction and contains the balance status of the traders. Additionally, as everyone knows all the transactions in Bitcoin system will be baled by only one miner that will result in a lot of wasted effort, so another way to improve resource utilization is to change the original way to compete for miller to election and parallel milting. Researchers simulated blockchain with graph structure and parallel mining through python, and suggested the conceptual new graph model which can improve both capacity and performance.

AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of Bitcoin. It is considered a prospect by industries such as finance, education and healthcare, due to its decentralization and non-tampering features. In the current Education-Industry cooperation, substantive information asymmetry exists between universities and employing companies. Student credit systems and the historical information data chain need urgent establishment and maintenance. The paper makes use of the transparency and non-tampering features of the blockchain system to implement an Education-Industry cooperative system based on the blockchain Hyperledger framework. Using the Certificate Authority service and transactions in the Hyperledger framework, the system simulates the roles of universities and companies in the system, and enables universities and enterprises to share information transparently, which achieves information symmetry among student skill and knowledge information, demands of enterprise recruitment, and current market trends. This offers a significant attempt on the application of blockchain technology to Education-Industry cooperation as a pilot development for technology deployment.

AB As one of the most successful Blockchain systems, Bitcoin evolved over the past 8 years. The collaborative contribution of its online software development community gradually shaped the functionality and performance of Bitcoin. To date, most discussions around Bitcoin are from technologies underlying the product, as well as market applications. There are very few studies on the development and evolution processes of the Bitcoin software. It is important to investigate on such developmental issues, in order to better understand the development methodologies and lessons learnt from such a spearheaded Blockchain system. This paper serves this purpose by examining the issues data extracted from the Bitcoin GitHub repository from 2011 to 2018. It reports the trends of the major development issues from a longitude perspective. The main results include: 1) the average lifespan of an issue in Bitcoin issue repository is approximately 57 days; and 2) the Top-7 issue types including refactoring, tests, doe, RPC.REST.ZMQ, GUI, bugs, and wallet, accounting for 64.3% of all issues; 3) topic modeling techniques are beneficial in mining popularity and evolution of key issue topics and most problematic architecture components. Using data analysis and visualization techniques. this paper suggests the insights for significant development decisions such as better managing issue repository and strategic allocating of bug resolution effort.

AB Autonomous vehicles are capable of sensing their environment and navigating without any human inputs. However, when autonomous vehicles are involved in accidents between themselves or with human subjects, liability must be indubitably decided based on accident forensics. This paper proposes a blockchain-inspired event recording system for autonomous vehicles. Due to the inefficiency and limited usage of certain blockchain features designed for the traditional cryptocurrency applications, we design a new "proof of event" mechanism to achieve indisputable accident forensics by ensuring that event information is trustable and verifiable. Specifically, we propose a dynamic federation consensus scheme to verify and confirm the new block of event data in an efficient way without any central authority. The security capability of the proposed scheme is also analyzed against different threat and attack models.

AB Advances in computer science have raised concerns about the privacy of personal information. Therefore solutions to address these concerns have to be found. Blockchain enables new approaches to solve privacy issues in distributed systems, but at the same time also raises new concerns with its openness and immutability. The European Union has taken steps towards addressing information privacy concerns and define rights of data subjects and obligations of controllers and processors of personal data. We will apply and discuss these in light of current Blockchain implementations. This will result in a guideline for GDPR compliant Blockchain developments in the future.

AB Blockchain and smart contract provide a convenient vehicle to build decentralize applications. Among varies Decenrtalized applications (DAPPs), exchange is one of the most mentioned ones. To fully-decentralized an exchange looks somehow like an utopia. Most works tried to use different methods to solve different problems on this subject. According to our observations, the problems caused by blockchain include 1) Long confirmation time, 2) Vulnerable to front running attack, 3) wasting on-chain resource, all these problems make a blockchain based exchange not user friendly. To deal with the above-mentioned problems, a hybrid centralized and decentralized exchange is presented in this work. By simulating the transaction execution processes and eliminating all the unwanted uncertainties, we are confident that the transactions in the proposed exchange center (EC) will be confirmed and executed well on the blockchain, that is, our system allows users to conclude their trades without need of waiting for a long blockchain confirmation time. In conclusion, a Hybrid Centralized and Decentralized Application (HCDAPP) provides a better-quality service, just like a centralized server; at the same time, it also provides a higher-level security, like a decentralized smart contract.

AB Crowd-sensing systems have gained considerable interests and adoption in recent years. However, most existing crowd-sensing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to low reliability due to the traditional centralized architecture and high service fee. Motivated by constructing a crowd-sensing system with security and low service fee, we propose a blockchain-based crowd-sensing system (BCS), which replaces traditional triangle architecture by decentralized blockchain system. Also, in order to accelerate the formation of the fabric of trust, BCS implements applications of smart contracts to reward sensing-task workers, which offers reliable anonymity in the meantime. By leveraging blockchain technology, BCS has good performance in privacy protection and system robustness.

AB With the development of internet of things (IoT) network in recent years, while the centralization data management brings longer delay while has more safety troubles. Moreover, once a single device is attacked, the system crashes. So, blockchain technique which could realize safety distributed data management is introduced. However, the consensus mechanism of blockchain consumes huge computation resources. And the storage of entire ledger also consumes huge storage resources of the blockchain nodes. Due to the limited capacity of IoT devices, the nodes cannot afford the computation resources to reach consensus and caching resources. This paper introduces an architecture of edge computing based blockchain network which makes use of the computation and caching capacity of edge server to help the IoT devices in reaching consensus and storing data.

AB At present, medical images account for nearly 70% of medical diagnostic data, which is an important basis for disease diagnosis. However, medical data leakage incidents have occurred in more than 90% medical institutions, the protection of patients' medical data is of great urgency. At present. all types of medical institutions involved in the medical imaging business use the PACS to archive, manage, and use the collected medical images. but only sharing the managed video resources within the organization. This method applies only the traditional data protection strategy and cannot guarantee a stronger protection for patients' private information. And patients have no control over medical information at the time of treatment. For this reason, this paper proposes a method of secure sharing of medical images based on smart contracts of block chain and credit scores. Through a blockchain based on distributed, reliable database of recording image sharing process, we realize a cross-organizational, cross-regional, trustworthy, and supervisory medical image sharing system. And the establishment of smart contracts based on credit scores of patients and medical institutions guarantee intelligent sharing by rules and conditions. Compared with traditional PACS, the method proposed in this paper extends its scope of application on the basis of PACS, increases its robustness, and provides new ideas for more extensive. multi-level, safe and reliable medical images sharing.

AB An online community based on blockchain is proposed for software developers to share, assess, and learn codes and other codes or software related knowledge. It involves three modules or roles, namely: developer (or coder, or more generally, knowledge contributor), code (or knowledge contribution), and jury (or assessor, who is usually a developer with advanced skills), in addition to the blockchain based database. Each full node of the blockchain hosts a copy of all activities of developers in such community, including uploading contributions, assessing others' contributions, and conducting transactions. Smart contracts are applicable to automate transactions after code assessment or other related activities. The system aims to assess and improve the value of codes accurately, stimulate the creativity of the developers, and improve software development efficiency, so as to establish a virtuous cycle of a software development community.

AB With the development of computer and network technology, on-board computers have more stronger capability of computing and network communication. Multiple vehicles can form an Autonomous Vehicular Cloud (AVC) for the certain need to provide cloud computing services for customers. However, the infrastructure of AVC is open completely, how to guarantee the non-repudiation of task execution information is a very important issue during the process of task execution. Blockchain technology is a proven technology with information security and non-repudiation in distributed environments. Smart contract of Ethereum used to design a kind of task scheduling strategy which is suitable for the AVC environment in this paper. The strategy can guarantee the non-repudiation of task execution information. This paper builds the private chain of Ethereum on simulation vehicles node and creates and deploys the smart contract. Experiments show that the task scheduling strategy is very effective.

DE blockchain; decentralized system; cascade structure
AB Blockchain as a novel technology which consists of peer-to-peer network, distributed consensus, cryptography and other fundamental knowledge. Blockchain can help people build trust among untrusted people, which will help people establish new application models in multiple areas. But there are several legacy problems which obstruct the deployment and development of blockchain, the biggest problem is blockchain performance that blockchain cannot process the transactions as much as the centralized server per second. We propose a cascade structure for blockchain, which can accelerate the block generation, enlarge the capacity of the block, reduce the risk of fork and increase the difficulty to launch the 51% attack.

AB The development of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) has brought many conveniences to human beings, but also brings a very prominent security problem. The traditional solution to the security problem is based on centralized approach which requires a trusted central entity which exists a single point of failure problem. Moreover, there is no approach of technical level to ensure security of data. Therefore, this paper proposes a security architecture of VANET based on blockchain and mobile edge computing. The architecture includes three layers, namely perception layer, edge computing layer and service layer. The perception layer ensures the security of VANET data in the transmission process through the blockchain technology. The edge computing layer provides computing resources and edge cloud services to the perception layer. The service layer uses the combination of traditional cloud storage and blockchain to ensure the security of data.

AB In the area of loT (Internet of Things), more and more intelligent devices are being connected to the Internet. These intelligent devices have been producing a huge amout of useful data over time, however there is still a lack of a platform which can efficiently transfer and utilize the value of the massive loT data. Blockchain is able to transfer value kith a relative low cost, which makes it possible for the data from smart devices to create economic value. This work of this paper is to design a high performance bloc I:chain platform, using technologies such as distributed network architecture, intelligent devices node mapping, as well as PBFT-DPOC consensus algorithm to realize the decentralized autonomy of intelligent devices.

AB Blockchain has been widely recognized as the trust machine underpinning the Internet of Things(IoT). However, the poor performance of the existing mainstream platforms renders this expectation unattainable. New technologies like DAG and Hashgraph emerge as promising candidates to address the pressing issues, but their abilities in decentralized consensus are still in question. We propose a 3D-DAG model to address the trilemma of decentralization, scalability and security. Experiment results show that, by adopting the separation of concerns(SOC) architectural principle and a software defined chain(SDC) approach, 3D-DAG can meet challenging requirements expected by IoT applications.

AB Information asymmetry and false information are disturbing and have been damaging investors' interests in investment management. The current studies usually only aim to evaluate the value of enterprises to reduce the degree of information falsehood, but they can't solve the problem from the origin. In this paper, we use the blockchain technologies to restructure the enterprise value system to lower the impacts of these problems, including improving value chain of enterprises with smart-contracts, defining token as an incentive method and using token to evaluate the value of enterprises. Then implementing the new value system into the internet industry to accomplish industrialization. We find that the novel value system not only saves the costs Of time and wages, but also ensures the authenticity and reliability of enterprises data.

DE value system; blockchain; smart contracts; token mechanism; listed banks
AB Centered on the value of listed banks in investment management, this article proposes an automatic pattern recognition value system based on blockchain. It will be of great value for investors to reasonably estimate the stock value of listed banks. In this way, the investors will make a better investment decision, which will realize the rational allocation of social resources. The new value system includes three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; (c) assessment of value. In the framework, we encapsulate the valuable business processes of listed banks through smart contracts. The cryptographic algorithms and token mechanism ensure the normal operation of the transaction. We record the value of listed banks by distributed ledger technology. Consensus mechanism verifies the validity of records. Meanwhile, the token mechanism completes the value transfer and acts as an incentive measure for network node accounting. Finally, we evaluate the value of listed banks from integration, optimization, control, and value-added satisfaction services. Therefore, the new value system can correctly guide investors in making a rational investment, which will increase investment returns and ultimately realize the rational allocation of social resources.

AB Modern Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, gain more and more popularity in the blockchain community and their adoption has already been started. Combining smart-contract execution with TEEs promises efficient solutions for protecting data privacy in distributed ledgers, as an alternative to much more costly cryptographic protocols.
   This paper describes practical challenges that arise from the combination of smart contracts with TEEs. In particular, we discuss existing solutions and their conceptional differences of on-chain and off-chain execution followed by technical challenges on attestation, key management, and non-deterministic execution.

DE Internet of Things; Blockchain; Smart contract; Security; Threats
AB We are now living in the significant era where technologies are advancing very quickly. Among the leading technologies, Internet of Things or IoT in short is standing at the peak of inflated expectation in the Gartner Hype Cycle [1]. The application of IoT has evolved from home appliances in the smart home environment such as smart tv, smart refrigerator, smart door and has grown into smart building, smart city, smart healthcare, smart industry. We could imagine that everything could go online to cut cost, add value to businesses and increase users convenience. The prediction has been made [2] that there will be 50 Billion IoT devices by 2020.
   Along the new revolution there has also been threats that significantly warned us if we didn't take security into account some bad things could happen, such as Mirai botnet [3] attacked dyn DNS server by using vulnerable IoT devices which turned smart devices became exploitable or vulnerable devices and named as the weakness link of the network. At the same time another hype among technology communities of using
   Blockchain Technology to secure the Internet of Things is getting mainstream. Blockchain is not a silver bullet to secure Internet of Things, in this paper we will propose an architecture model of using a Blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric to secure the Internet of Things network in a smart classroom scenario and integrated with The Thing Networks (TTN) cloud server and demonstrates the opportunities and challenges of this concept by taking security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation to evaluate the concept.

   trends of Blockchain
AB In the "Industry 4.0" era, blockchain as well as related distributed ledger technologies has academy and industry become famous as the cryptocurrencies such as been an unmissable trend for both recently. Blockchain technology has innovative technology that underlies Bitcoin and Ethereum platform. It also has been spreading with multiple industries exploring their capabilities and new blockchain use cases springing up on a daily basis. Its emergence has brought a great deal of impact on how the information will be stored and processed securely. Furthermore, almost of advocates say that blockchain will disrupt and change everything from education to financial payments, insurance, intellectual property, healthcare,... in the years to come. However, a comprehensive survey on potential and issues of blockchain adoption in academy and industry has not been yet accomplished. This paper tries to conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology adoption by discussing its influences as well as the opportunities and challenges when utilizing it in the real-world scenarios.

AB By using a decentralized peer-to-peer network together with public and distributed ledger to decentralize the central authority, Blockchain has shown its great potential with the success of Bit coin. However, the blockchain technology can go beyond financial transactions. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes the blockchain technology to issue immutable digital certificates and improve the current limitations of the existing certificate verifying systems such as faster, more trusted, and independent of the central authority. Our prototype has been successfully deployed for several short-term courses at the Center of Computer Engineering, HCMC University of Technology, Vietnam. This result indicates that our proposed system is an appropriate solution adopting ICT for e-government, especially in certificate and diploma management.

AB This paper gives a definition of collective self consumption and introduces the current regulatory framework in some European countries. It proposes a review of relevant Demand Side Management (DSM) methods applicable to improve the collective self-consumption rate. It also introduces the concept of blockchain and its possible applications to collective self-consumption, with a focus on some current experimentations. Current blockchain applications include validation of measured data and energy transactions. New architectures propose a completely decentralized energy market and grid control based on the blockchain technology. However, a deeper analysis of the benefit of blockchain is required. The legal framework will also play a role on the future deployment of these applications.

DE Blockchain; Incentives; Retrospective Detection
AB Internet of Things (IoT) has already been in the period of rapid development and widespread deployment, while it is still vulnerable to various malicious attacks. Security detection before system installation is not enough to ensure that IoT devices are always secure, because newly emerging vulnerabilities can still be exploited to launch attacks. To address this issue, retrospective detection is often required to trace the security status of IoT systems. Unfortunately, existing centralized detection mechanisms cannot easily provide a comprehensive security analysis. In particular, consumers cannot automatically receive security notification whenever a new vulnerability is uncovered. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-powered incentive platform, called SmartRetro, that can incentivize and attract more distributed detectors to participate in retrospective vulnerability detection and contribute their detection results. Leveraging smart contracts, consumers in SmartRetro receive automatic security feedback about their installed IoT systems. We perform the security and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that SmartRetro achieves our desirable security goals. We further implement SmartRetro prototype on Ethereum to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results show SmartRetro is technically feasible and economically beneficial.

AB The popularity and applicability of mobile crowdsensing applications are continuously increasing due to the widespread of mobile devices and their sensing and processing capabilities. However, we need to offer appropriate incentives to the mobile users who contribute their resources and preserve their privacy. Blockchain technologies enable semi-anonymous multi-party interactions and can be utilized in crowdsensing applications to maintain the privacy of the mobile users while ensuring first-rate crowdsensed data. In this work, we propose to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts to orchestrate the interactions between mobile crowdsensing providers and mobile users for the case of spatial crowdsensing, where mobile users need to be at specific locations to perform the tasks. Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users' privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving auction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for high numbers of mobile users and tasks.

AB Wearable smart sensing devices presently become more and more popular in peoples daily life, which also brings serious problems related to personal data privacy. In order to provide users better experiences, wearable smart sensing devices are collecting users' personal data all the time and uploading the data to service provider to get computing services, which objectively let service provider master each user's condition and cause a lot of problems such as spam, harassing call, etc. This paper designs a blockchain based scheme to solve such problems by cutting off the association between user identifier and its sensing data from perspective of shielding service providers and adversaries. Firstly, privacy requirements and situations in smart sensing area are reviewed. Then, three key technologies are introduced in the scheme including its theories, purposes and usage. Next, the designed protocol is shown and analyzed in detail. Finally, security analysis and engineering feasibility of the scheme are given. This scheme will give user better experience from privacy protection perspective in smart sensing area.

AB This paper proposes a demand response framework for near-real time autonomous demand response management combined with a democratic market driven pricing scheme. The approach aims to aggregate groups of prosumers and develop new financial/business models for maximizing the prosumer's benefits in terms of: renewable energy usage maximization, cost minimization, etc. The framework will feature a blockchain based near-real time closed-loop semand response validation, fully autonomous, secured and decentralized. This will enact each prosumer with the possibility to verify the authenticity and integrity of all DR events and bid notifications.

AB Distributed renewable energy systems have been proposed as the future of energy supply. However, many technological, governance, and societal obstacles must be eliminated before this vision becomes mainstream. This paper analyzes different business models which could contribute to this change by attracting new consumers to distributed energy schemes. Consumers interest is organized along 6 parameters and state-of-art technologies are compared against them to detect technological gaps which could delay or prevent a successful implementation of these systems. The chosen method is a comparative analysis of selected commercial offers in four continents which implement new technologies and show a real-life test of its advantages, shortcomings and potential future improvements

TI The Formation of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts in the Light of
   Contract Law
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB This contribution examines the formation of (blockchain-based) smart contracts. The term smart contract is used to refer to software programmes which are often, but not necessarily, built on blockchain technology as a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises. It is regularly said that smart contracts are neither legal contracts in the traditional sense nor they are smart and that the term is therefore a misnomer. The crucial question this article is trying to answer is whether the traditional common law concept of contract formation is seriously challenged by the rise of smart contracts. As such, are smart contracts marking the end of contract formation as we know it or is it just much ado about nothing?

TI Interpretation of Contracts and Smart Contracts: Smart Interpretation or
   Interpretation of Smart Contracts?
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The computer language (computer code) on the basis of which smart contracts are written is different from the natural (Human) language. Computer language is a 'dry' language, whereas natural language is 'wet'. In other words, it means that computer language is deterministic (just one meaning and one result are conceivable), when natural language is open to more and potential different meanings. Natural language requires therefore in itself interpretation, at least more than computer language. Computer language in theory doesn't require and possibly doesn't leave room for interpretation. If this assumption is accurate, what are the consequences of it (on the intention of the parties, on contract drafting, on courts' intervention.)? Building on that assumption, this article explores, from a comparative perspective, the impact of the blockchain- based smart contract technology, especially regarding contract drafting techniques. Contract drafting style in common law (long contracts, based on a 'if., then..' approach, quite similar to the coding approach) is in part based on the idea of preventing courts' interpretation and intervention. In civil law countries instead, contracts are generally shorter, for several reasons but partly because drafters tend to rely on more general legal concepts, external to the contract, and know that courts will play an important role, through interpretation, in disclosing the 'true meaning' of a contract. Coding contracts and relying on computer- code language can hence have a significant impact on the civil law approach and bring the two legal systems closer as far as contract drafting and contract interpretation are concerned.

TI Quandary of Smart Contracts and Remedies: The Role of Contract Law and
   Self-Help Remedies
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID TRADE
AB Smart contracts provide a quandary for contract law remedies. The self-enforcing nature of smart contracts implies that there is little possibility for breach and thus, little need or opportunity to apply contract law remedies. This article explores if this is really the case. It concludes that contract law remains applicable to smart contracts relating to the enforceability of its terms based on legality, public policy, and contracts policing doctrines. In such cases, post hoc judicial or arbitral claims remain likely and the dispute resolution bodies would seek to apply contract remedies. In order to diminish instances of litigation or arbitration the smart contract should include self-remedying or internal measures (remedies). The article divides internal measures into proactive and reactive measures. These measures should be considered in the drafting of a smart contract in order to diminish resort to contract remedies. In the end, contract law and contract remedies will remain important as default law. In addition, like smart contracts, some of contract law rules are immutable and cannot be made obsolete by blockchain technology.

TI Blockchain & Data Protection ... and Why They Are Not on a Collision
   Course
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent publications on the data protection aspects of blockchain technology focus on the characteristics of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain, and do so in a generalized manner. The authors then conclude that the characteristics of a public blockchain are profoundly incompatible at a conceptual level with the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR requires identification of a central 'controller' who is responsible for compliance with the GDPR, while a public blockchain decentralizes the storage and processing of personal data, as a result whereof there is no such central point of control. For lack of a better alternative, the authors conclude that all 'nodes' involved in operating a blockchain qualify as a controller under the GDPR, raising enforcement and jurisdictional issues that make it impossible for individuals to enforce their rights. The transparency and immutability of a public blockchain would further not sit well with principles of data confidentiality, data minimization, data accuracy and the rights of individuals to correction and deletion of their data.
   I disagree with the analysis of these authors for a host of different reasons, the main one being that the authors focus on the shortcomings of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain when already many new types of permissioned private and consortium blockchain have been developed that significantly diverge from the original, permissionless public blockchain. In fact, these types of permissioned blockchain have been developed in response to the shortcomings of public blockchain. The authors further consider the data processing implications of blockchain as if this technology constitutes in itself a data processing activity for which a controller has to be identified. Controllership is, however, decided based on a specific use or deployment of a certain technology. Blockchain, like the internet, is a general-purpose technology that is subsequently deployed by actors for a certain purpose in a specific context. Applying the question of controllership to the internet at large would pose similar data protection issues under the GDPR as identified by the authors in respect of blockchain. This publication explains why none of these issues are currently hampering application of the GDPR to the internet and are equally unlikely to pose issues for blockchain applications. This publication describes the issues in their broader context, as well as how each of these issues can be addressed to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The conclusion is that the GDPR is also well able to regulate this new technology. This does not, however, mean that blockchain will thus be suitable for all use and deployment cases.

DT Article
AB Any discussion of the legal issues surrounding blockchain technologies seems doomed from the outset. The sheer amount and complexity of technical terms, which are often used inconsistently, precludes an exhaustive and disciplined analysis of the potential legal problems that could arise from the widespread, commercial use of blockchains. Consequently, the evaluation of the popular claims hailing blockchains as enablers of commerce is extremely challenging. Additional complications arise from the fact that blockchain technologies are accompanied by multiple ideological concepts that, at times, seem to preclude logical reasoning. Terms such as 'decentralization' or 'trustlessness' are presented as ultimate values that must be strived towards at any cost - even if their full implementation leads to commercially undesirable results. Acknowledging the practical impossibility to provide a thorough explanation of the relevant technological concepts and to surmount claims that 'commerce must be decentralized', this article provides an overview of the different types of blockchains and presents their practical shortcomings. It focuses on the division between permissionless and permissioned blockchains to demonstrate that only the latter could potentially serve as electronic platforms supporting a wide range of commercial transactions. The main point made in this article is that technology, irrespective of its sophistication, cannot exist without a supporting legal infrastructure - and without regard to legal requirements.

DT Article
AB Considering that the internationality of a contract as well as its national character opens up opportunities for the contracting parties, particularly in the domains of dispute settlement mechanisms and applicable Law that they can eventually opt for, the present contribution analyses legal issues resulting from the fact that parties are nevertheless submitted to an obligation to comply with mandatory provisions and public policy rules depending on the location of some key elements of their agreement. This applies, even though it is about smart contracts and blockchain technologies. This article focuses on property and security rights issues (: defective title, informational defects and viruses.) in the context of the Civil Law tradition.

AB This article explores whether the legal landscape will be fundamentally changed in view of the emergence of smart contracts in China. Beyond the phenomenon of bitcoin supported by blockchain technology, we examine the development of smart contracts on blockchain with a close scrutiny of their merits and limits, and the intrinsic legal uncertainties in their application. The main argument is that while the gaps between the regulatory framework and the business practice can be identified, for most parts, the current legal framework can accommodate or mitigate the legal risks brought about by smart contracts.

DE blockchain; procedural fairness; reputation; autonomous identity; trust;
   reciprocity; collaboration; "Active citizen"
ID TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGY
AB In the theory of public policy, it is essential to find a fair procedure that could be used to obtain an equitable result in the course of choosing and making public decisions. Blockchain, as a network of distributed registers, is often positioned as a political institution that ensures the fairness of decisions by voting on the basis of a pure procedure. Political theory distinguishes between pure, perfect and imperfect procedural justice. The last two types of procedural justice are based on the criterion of a fair result, which is achieved on the basis of a perfect and imperfect procedure. Pure procedural justice is indifferent to a certain resulting criterion; it can be used to solve any issues. This article analyzes the political ontology of the pure procedural justice of blockchain technology, which relies not on the legal nature of the constitution of interaction in the network, but on the technical and social immediacy of cooperation and joint production. These qualities of pure procedural justice in the blockchain, as shown in the article, are provided by the relevant protocols and create the conditions for maintaining a reputation, forming an autonomous identity and building a special trust regime. An equally fair consensus procedure based on reciprocity and autonomy is also important. The article proves that such an institutional configuration of the blockchain acts as an analog of the political concept of J. Rawls's justice as honesty. The empirical basis of the study is the analysis of cases of using blockchain-voting on the platform "Active citizen" (Moscow).

AB The Bitcoin backbone protocol (Eurocrypt 2015) extracts basic properties of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure, such as "common prefix" and "chain quality," and shows how fundamental applications including consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them. The underlying assumptions are " proofs of work" (POWs), adversarial hashing power strictly less than 1/2 and no adversarial pre-computation-or, alternatively, the existence of an unpredictable "genesis" block.
   In this paper we first show how to remove the latter assumption, presenting a "bootstrapped" Bitcoin-like blockchain protocol relying on POWs that builds genesis blocks "from scratch" in the presence of adversarial pre-computation. Importantly, the round complexity of the genesis block generation process is independent of the number of participants.
   Next, we consider applications of our construction, including a PKI generation protocol and a consensus protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power). Previous results in the same setting (unauthenticated parties, no trusted setup, POWs) required a round complexity linear in the number of participants.

AB Decentralised (on-blockchain) and centralised (off blockchain) platforms are available for the implementation of smart contracts. However, none of the two alternatives can individually provide the services and quality of services (QoS) imposed on smart contracts involved in a large class of applications. The reason is that blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Likewise, off blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks emerging from their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several applications, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on and off blockchain platforms are more adequate. Developers that informatively choose between the three alternatives are likely to implement smart contracts that deliver the expected QoS. Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap and as a proof of concept, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. We show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the rinkeby ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool.

AB Technological application in business is enormous as corporate institutions are striving to reduce operational cost and to maximize profit as well as to create enabling environment for efficiency and effectiveness. One of the disruptive technologies for business application is Blockchain Technology. Emerging markets are taking advantage of Blockchain technology's integration and application in the financial service industry to break new grounds for better service delivery. The integration of Blockchain technology in fund management business would enhance data credibility, transparency, accuracy, accountability and immutability between fund managers and investors. This is due to the security features of data storage in Blockchain technology that make data alteration difficult. This paper discusses about the mutual funds management in Ghana. The paper also introduces the prospects of Blockchain Technology in Fund Management in Ghana.

AB This paper proposes to first identify the basic requirement of common citizens in their day to day life, as their attachments are mainly with the crucial documents such as lands records and basic certificates which are needed to avail government facilities and services. The essential information are collected and stored in verified form to make them available 'Over the Counter' through 'under one roof unit' concept. It can be done through digitizing 'Parivar Register' to generate results using artificial intelligence with the help of designed algorithms for the same and this public record can be stored through block chain technology for the management of government trusted information. This will help them to curtail time loss component in service delivery mechanism, avail needed certificates, gather information about their queries and eligibility for different government and non-government benefits, at one single point, and will give a perception of a smart e-village.

AB In this paper a solution for the removal of long tail blocktimes in a proof-of-work blockchain is proposed, implemented and analysed. Results from the mainnet of the Bismuth blockchain demonstrate that the variances in the key variables, difficulty level and blocktime, were more than halved after the tail removal code was enabled. Low variances in difficulty and blocktimes are desirable for timely execution of transactions in the network as well as reduction of unwanted oscillations in the feedback control problem.

AB The use of distributed ledger technologies introduces new security and privacy challenges. These challenges are dependent on properties of the ledgers, such as transaction latency and throughput. Some use cases may be outright impossible to implement securely, or in a privacy-retaining manner. Consequently, it is important that these concerns are taken into account when distributed ledger technologies are evaluated and selected as building blocks for higher-level systems. In this paper, we illustrate these concerns through use case examples. We discuss the implications these concerns on the use of distributed ledgers within higher-level systems, such as in SOFIE, a DLT-based approach to securely and openly federate IoT systems.

AB Recently, there is a growing trend towards machine learning models that run on client devices such as smartphones, with constraints such as model size and time. Often, the user data on client devices is considered private and so cannot be uploaded to an external server for processing and running the model. Blockchain provides a new way of sharing data that is secure and decentralized. In this paper, we provide a way to use blockchain to run a machine learning model in a decentralized way using various nodes to compute part of the learning task. We apply our system in a smart home IoT setting to generate user customizations based on user activity prediction for IoT devices. We use distributed association rule mining to generate the rules of user activity from the device logs. We describe the system architecture and simulate the system using Ethereum based tools.

AB Voting is an important part of the administration of a country. Votes are still being carried out by physically going to voting booths. This process doesn't guarantee security and cases of tampering has been observed. This paper aims at removing these issues in the voting process by making it online and using the technology, Blockchain. Blockchain uses encryption and hashing to make every vote secure. In this case, one vote is considered as a transaction. A peer to peer network is created to create a private blockchain that share this distributed ledger having voting transaction. The application is designed in such a way so that the intricacies of the underlying architecture is hidden from the user. Each voter is uniquely identified by Government approved Aadhar number. The application makes use of this number to make sure that each voter gets only one chance to vote. When the vote gets submitted as a transaction then all the peers get synch up. Since each peer is associated with a public and private key the votes are encrypted and hashed and added to the blockchain to increase security and form a chain of blocks. Votes cannot be tracked back to the voter. In this paper, a peer to peer network is created having minimum three peers. Since voting is made online, it is expected that this paper will increase the voter turnouts. The scalability of the blockchain application depends on the secondary memory limit of the peer.

AB In the world of technology, change is the only constant. As soon as people start adapting to a new invention, another innovation starts paving its way into people's lives. Each change in technology brings in new and improved devices. Old devices are replaced and abandoned. Such Electronic and Electrical Equipments (EEEs) that are discarded by users are termed as e-waste. Management of e-waste includes proper collection, segregation and recycling of discarded devices in an environment friendly manner. The volume of EEEs that is produced throughout the world, has led governments in various countries to create strict policies, to ensure efficient disposal of the generated e-waste. The Indian government also upgraded its E-Waste Management (EWM) laws in 2016 and 2018. These laws are a step towards environment friendly disposal of e-waste but their compliance is still at a nascent stage. Even today, e-waste collection and recycling in India is largely dominated by the unorganized sector, which makes the enforcement of such laws very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for EWM using blockchain based smart contracts. Blockchain is the technology that enables us to write smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing computer codes that take specified actions when certain conditions are met in the real world. EWM using smart contracts will bring more coordination among producers, importers, retailers and recyclers of EEEs. It will enable the government to regulate e-waste collection and recycling. It will also reduce the imbalance between the organized and unorganized sectors which will lead to increased transparency throughout the process.

AB Smart interconnected vehicles generate a huge amount of data to be used by a wide range of applications. Although cloud based data management is currently in practice, for many applications serving road safety or traffic regulation, it is utmost important that applications access these data at the site itself for improved quality of service. Road side units (RSUs) play a crucial role in handling these vast amount of vehicular data and serving the running applications in turn. In this current era of edge computing, in-place data access is also proven to be advantageous from cost point of view. As multiple applications from different service providers are interested to access different fragments of these data, a robust access control mechanism is needed to ensure desired level of security as well as reliability for these data. In this paper, we introduce B2VDM, a novel architecture for vehicular data management at RSUs, that provides a seamless access control using Blockchain technology. The proposed B2VDM framework also implements a simple load distribution module, which maintains the reliability by minimizing the number of packet drops at a heavily loaded RSU during peak hours. An extensive evaluation using Etherium Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

AB Context. We consider security properties of decentralized blockchain-based consensus protocols. The object of research is block confirmation time for users to get assurance that their transaction will not be reverted.
   Objective. The goal of the paper is to analyze double-spend attacks on the different blockchain-based systems and compare resulting probabilities of attacker's success.
   Method. We presented two models for two types of attacks on the Ouroboros protocol (for the general and covert adversaries). The models allow calculating the exact number of slots needed to achieve the required level of security. It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1%. We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol.
   Results. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol. We compared minimal number of confirmation blocks needed to ensure a high security for considered protocols: Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros.
   Conclusions. The obtained results allow determination of security bounds for the Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros consensus protocols. Users of the practically deployed blockchain systems may get specific parameters for a given assurance level.

AB Socialising in virtual reality environments is becoming increasingly popular. Research outlines the possibility of using the blockchain technology in order to create a peer-to-peer network for the virtual reality environment. By doing so, this paper considers the possibilities of decentralising the virtual reality space which was previously accessed through centralised platforms. There is a growing support for the claim that participation between peers is higher on a decentralised virtual reality platform compared to participation on a centralised platform. This study draws on ethnographic research of a digital community formed around a decentralised virtual reality platform and observes their group activities and engagements. The paper finds that individuals tend to show a high activity when it comes to co-designing virtual worlds and puts forward three concepts to discuss positive and negative angles of the decentralised virtual reality, i.e. co-creation of the content, visuals and governance. This implication is supported by an observation that users of the decentralised virtual reality platform co-build virtual ecosystems without a centralised authority.

AB The development of Energy-Internet is currently suffering from a series of issues, such as the conflicts among high capital requirement, low-cost, high efficiency, the spreading gap between capital demand and supply, as well as the lagged trading & valuation mechanism, any of which would hinder Energy-Internet's evolution. However, with the development of Blockchain and big-data technology, it is possible to work out solutions for these issues. Based on current situation of Energy-Internet and its requirements for future progress, this paper demonstrates the validity of employing blockchain technology to solve the problems encountered by Energy-Internet during its development. It proposes applying the blockchain and big-data technologies to pricing and trading energy products through Energy-Internet and to accomplish cyber-based energy or power's transformation from physic products to financial assets.

AB In order to design a reliable and convenient tally method, the emergence of a tally system solves the problem of high database maintenance costs, such as management of the site factory, telecom, power companies, etc. The novel phases, constituted of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the block chain, extracts character characteristics through the VGG network training character classification model. The principal component analysis(PCA) algorithm accelerates feature comparison efficiency by reducing the dimensions of the feature matrix. In terms of data storage, the consistency of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance(PBFT) algorithm ensures the accuracy of the data. The experiment demonstrates that practicability of the system can catch the requirements of the automatic bookkeeping method in the construction site.

AB We introduce our solution developed for data privacy, and specifically for cognitive security that can be enforced and guaranteed using blockchain technology in SAAL (Smart Ambient Assisted Living) environments. Personal clinical and demographic information segments to various levels that assures that it can only be rebuilt at the interested and authorized parties and no profiling can be extracted from the blockchain itself. Using our proposal the access to a patients clinical process resists tampering and ransomware attacks that have recently plagued the HIS (Hospital Information Systems) in various countries. The core of the blockchain model assures non-repudiation possible by any of the involved information producers thus maintaining ledger fidelity of the enclosed historical process information. One important side effect of this data infrastructure is that it can be accessed in open form, for research purposes for instance, since no individual re-identification or group profiling is possible by any means.

ID LOGIC
AB Smart contracts have been proposed as executable implementations enforcing real-life contracts. Unfortunately, the semantic gap between these allows for the smart contract to diverge from its intended deontic behaviour. In this paper we show how a deontic contract can be used for real-time monitoring of smart contracts specifically and request-based interactive systems in general, allowing for the identification of any violations. The deontic logic of actions we present takes into account the possibility of action failure (which we can observe in smart contracts), allowing us to consider novel monitorable semantics for deontic norms. For example, taking a rights-based view of permissions allows us to detect the violation of a permission when a permitted action is not allowed to succeed. A case study is presented showing this approach in action for Ethereum smart contracts.

DE Blockchain; chameleons hash functions; data protection; encryption;
   hashing-out methods; right to erasure
AB GDPR abiding blockchain systems are feasible. Jurists, programmers, and other experts are increasingly working on this aim nowadays. Still, manifold blockchain networks functioning out there suggest a new generation of data protection issues brought about by this technology. Some of these issues will likely concern the right to erasure set up by Art. 17 of the EU data protection regulation ('GDPR'). These cases will soon be discussed before national authorities and courts, and will likely test the technical solutions explored in this paper, such as hashing out methods, keys destruction, chameleon hash functions, and more. By taking into account matters of design and the complex architecture of blockchains, we shall distinguish between blockchains that have been thought about to expressly meet the requirements of the EU regulation, and blockchains that, for one reason or another, e.g. ante GDPR designed blockchains, trigger some sort of clash with the legal order, that is, (i) matters of principle on e.g. political decentralization; (ii) standards on security and data protection; (iii) a mix of them; and, (iv) social clash. It is still unclear how the interplay of legal regulation, technological constraints, social norms, and market interests, will end up in this context. Rulings and court orders will be instructive. It is a clash foretold, after all.

AB Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing--or the insertion of data in the blockchain--is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PM (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as "distributed ledger technology" and "permissioned blockchains." Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PM and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need first to identify pain points in governance, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.

AB In this extended abstract, we propose a conceptual framework that leverages distributed ledger technology and smart contracts to create a decentralized system to capture the occurrence of interesting development activities (e.g., a development build) and associated contextual data, and automatically audit and evaluate compliance to governance policies. Our hypothesis is that such a framework will facilitate easier sharing of information across all participants of a distributed development team, compliance evaluation and early mitigation actions, leading to greater visibility and compliance. Currently, the proof of concept we are working on is focused on sharing and compliance evaluation of the open-source components used in software development.

AB Logistics management plays a crucial role in the execution and success of international trades. Current solutions for logistics management suffer from a number of issues. One of the major areas for improvement is inconsistent data and lack of trust and transparency between multiple participants. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) or blockchain has the inherent characteristics to address this issue, and is well suited to be applied to supply chain document and workflow management. This paper demonstrates how to apply DLT to achieve a higher level of efficiency through consistent data store, automated workflow process, and tamper-proof transaction history for provenance in the supply chain.

AB There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to avoid large sized blocks. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.

AB Audit logs serve as a critical component in the enterprise business systems that are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks, which enable adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchains to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit, and outline its operational procedures. We implement our design on Hyperledger and evaluate its performance in terms of latency, network size, and payload size. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into Block-Audit to achieve higher security, integrity, and fault tolerance.

AB The emergence of big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is reshaping the world. While the technological revolution improves the quality of our life, new concerns are triggered. The superhuman capability enables AI to outperform human workers in many data-and/or computing-intensive tasks. Also, digital superpowers are showing arrogance towards individuals, which erodes the trust foundation of the society. In this position paper, we suggest to construct trustworthy and safe communities based on a BLockchain-Enabled Social credits System (BLESS) that rewards the residents who commit in socially beneficial activities. Human being's true value lies in serving other people. The BLESS system is considered as an efficient approach to promote the value and dignity in efforts focused on enhancing our communities and regulating business and private behaviors. The BLESS system leverages the decentralized architecture of the blockchain network, which not only allows grassroots individuals to participate rating process of a social credit system (SCS), but also provides tamper proof of transaction data in the trustless network environment. The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from being targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises. Smart contract enabled authentication and authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized entity from accessing the credit system. The BLESS scheme is promising to offer a secure, transparent and decentralized SCS.

AB Blockchain technology has been increasingly used for decentralizing cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) architectures to address some limitations faced by centralized systems. While many existing efforts are successful in leveraging blockchain for decentralization with multiple servers (full nodes) to handle faulty nodes, an important issue has arisen that external clients (also called lightweight clients) have to rely on a relay node to communicate with the full nodes in the blockchain. Compromization of such relay nodes may result in a security breach and even a blockage of IoT sensors from the network. We propose censorship resistant decentralized IoT management systems, which include a "diffusion" function to deliver all messages from sensors to all full nodes and an augmented consensus protocol to check data loss, replicate processing outcome, and facilitate opportunistic outcome delivery. We also leverage the cryptographic tool of aggregate signature to reduce the complexity of communication and signature verification.

AB Cryptocurrencies have recently gained huge popularity. It is desirable to come up with effective approaches to constructing better blockchain protocols. In this paper, inspired by the 2-hop design by Duong et al (ePrint 2016/716), we put forth a generic paradigm for blockchain design, called n-hop blockchain. It includes one main chain, which is supported by (n - 1) supporting chains; hence, the main chain can achieve better security performance. In our paradigm, we show that our n-hop design can be easily extended to (n + 1)-hop design. To demonstrate the power of our paradigm, we showcase two instantiations: 2-hop blockchain variant, a combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work, and 3-hop blockchain variant, which is extended from 2-hop blockchain variant by adding Byzantine fault tolerance blockchain in 3rd hop.

AB Permissioned Blockchain (PBC) has become a prevalent data structure to ensure that the records are immutable and secure. However, PBC still has significant challenges before it can be realized in different applications. One of such challenges is the overhead of the communication which is required to execute the Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol that is needed for consensus building. As such, it may not be feasible to implement PBC for resource constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we assess the communication overhead of running BA in an IoT environment that consists of wireless nodes (e.g., Raspberry PIs) with meshing capabilities. As the the packet loss ratio is significant and makes BA unfeasible to scale, we propose a network coding based approach that will reduce the packet overhead and minimize the consensus completion time of the BA. Specifically, various network coding approaches are designed as a replacement to TCP protocol which relies on unicasting and acknowledgements. The evaluation on a network of Raspberry PIs demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve scalability making BA feasible for medium size IoT networks.

AB Extensive online knowledge sharing can be exploited to solve tasks better, faster and cheaper, and it garners considerable interest in institutional cooperation, learning communities, etc., while many technical problems, such as fair exchange in incentive design and security issues are waiting to be solved. Blockchain technique has high accountability and thus has potential to improve the transparency and security of knowledge sharing. In this paper, to address the above problems, first we propose a Reputation Based Knowledge Sharing system in blockchain, called RBKS. The aim of RBKS is to exploit the copyright protection of the knowledge owner using our proposed fine-grained access control system, and to achieve the paid-for content service which allows bystanders who are interested in the shared knowledge to pay a small fee for the access. Second, a reputation evaluation algorithm is introduced as the core of the incentive, and it may possibly be combined with stake in blockchain to form a hybrid stake for the RBKS system. Third, a blockchain and a trusted storage server are employed together for sharing and storing knowledge, and the main procedures are implemented with smart contract in blockchain to ensure secure execution and fairness. Finally, our analysis shows that the RBKS system is feasible and secure.

DE Delegated Proof-of-Stake; Randomization; Distributed Key Generation;
   Threshold Signature; Bilinear Pairing
AB Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is an efficient, decentralized, and flexible consensus framework available in the blockchain industry. However, applying DPoS to the decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) applications is quite challenging due to the nature of IoT systems such as large-scale deployments and huge amount of data. To address the unique challenge for IoT based blockchain applications, we present Roll-DPoS, a randomized delegated proof of stake algorithm. Roll-DPoS inherits all the advantages of the original DPoS consensus framework and further enhances its capability in terms of decentralization as well as extensibility to complex blockchain architectures. A number of modern cryptographic techniques have been utilized to optimize the consensus process with respect to the computational and communication overhead.

AB We present ARCHANGEL; a de-centralised platform for ensuring the long-term integrity of digital documents stored within public archives. Document integrity is fundamental to public trust in archives. Yet currently that trust is built upon institutional reputation - trust at face value in a centralised authority, like a national government archive or University. ARCHANGEL proposes a shift to a technological underscoring of that trust, using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to cryptographically guarantee the provenance, immutability and so the integrity of archived documents. We describe the ARCHANGEL architecture, and report on a prototype of that architecture build over the Ethereum infrastructure. We report early evaluation and feedback of ARCHANGEL from stakeholders in the research data archives space.

AB The need to process the verity, volume and velocity of data generated by today's Internet of Things (IoT) devices has pushed both academia and the industry to investigate new architectural alternatives to support the new challenges. As a result, Edge Computing (EC) has emerged to address these issues, by placing part of the cloud resources (e.g., computation, storage, logic) closer to the edge of the network, which allows faster and context dependent data analysis and storage. However, as EC infrastructures grow, different providers who do not necessarily trust each other need to collaborate in order serve different IoT devices. In this context, EC infrastructures, IoT devices and the data transiting the network all need to be subject to identity and provenance checks, in order to increase trust and accountability. Each device/data in the network needs to be identified and the provenance of its actions needs to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a blockchain container based architecture that implements the W3C-PROV Data Model, to track identities and provenance of all orchestration decisions of a business network. This architecture provides new forms of interaction between the different stakeholders, which supports trustworthy transactions and leads to a new decentralized interaction model for IoT based applications.

AB Fog Computing, Augmented Reality (AR) and Blockchain are technologies that have been receiving more attention in recent years. Fog Computing for on-site data analysis and Blockchain as a decentralized framework are used to establish security and trust. AR enables new interactive scenarios with devices in the industrial environment and provides user interfaces for devices that had previously lacked one. The combination of these technologies in an industrial environment opens up new possibilities and opportunities. We present the IIoT Bazaar, a decentralized marketplace for industrial edge applications that relies on Blockchain to create transparency for all stakeholders involved and to enable the traceability of app installations on edge devices. With Fog Computing, resource-limited edge devices can be integrated into the IIoT Bazaar ecosystem. Fog Nodes enable the provisioning of applications on edge devices and their integration into a decentralized Blockchain network. AR serves as an interface between the users and the machines, allowing people to interact intuitively with the edge devices. With a case study, we demonstrate the design and prototypical implementation of the IIoT Bazaar and its applications which bring software developers and users together using a combination of Fog Computing, AR, and Blockchain. We share the challenges we faced and our experiences we made during the case study.

AB The H2020 European research project Safe Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) aims to develop a cyber-security layer on IoT smart home installations. The proposed system analyses packet-level data flows for building patterns of communications between IoT devices and external entities. To ensure non repudiation, integrity and authentication of the data captured, they are stored in a Blockchain, a distributed ledger network, as digitally-signed transactions. Since the data can potentially include sensitive user information, it is imperative to promote trust by informing users about the operating principles of the network as well as to request the acceptance of a consent form by them. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Forms of Consent application, a Distributed Application that interacts with a set of Smart Contracts deployed on a private Ethereum network. The application is being developed as part of the GHOST project.

AB Blockchain is one of the most hyped technologies of recent years. It promises to restructure the way applications are developed and to replace the widely client-server model used today. While the technology is promising the ecosystem of tools and development methodologies are still in their early stages. In this paper a proof of concept blockchain application is developed, regarding the exchange of data between different universities in different countries, with respect to the Erasmus program. A decentralized application has been designed from ground up and is proposed to be installed in multiple nodes located in all participating universities. Ethereum platform has been chosen and the required smart contracts have been implemented. Additionally an easy to use web interface have been developed in order to be usable for end users. We have evaluated both the development process and the efficiency of the resulting implementation.

AB The European research project GHOST challenges the traditional cyber security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by exploiting novel technologies, such as blockchain, to provide resilience and integrity of decision making on the communication exchange in a smart home context. When it comes to novel cyber security solutions for extremely heterogeneous environments like IoT and smart homes, the key focus is typically given to the understanding of network activities and elimination of suspicious traffic. The GHOST project adds an extra dimension to this approach by integrating blockchain technology at its core decision mechanism. On a daily basis, each GHOST installation is encountering malicious behaviour and suspicious IoT communications, where easy information sharing with other installations, as well as decentralised decision making, are mandatory features for the efficient protection of the end-user. GHOST's Smart Contracts (SC) are designed to tackle in an easy, yet productive way, the reporting on suspicious IP addresses which the IoT devices in a smart home are trying to communicate with. Two variations of blacklisting smart contracts are presented in this paper, covering a diverse spectrum of possible attack vectors while closely following the Privacy by Design (PbD) principles. A reputation scoring scheme for malicious IPs reporting is integrated in the SC, uncovering the implementation details on the penalisation of existing entries in case of malicious behaviour of reporting devices.

AB The aim of the proposed work is to introduce a secure and interoperable Demand Response (DR) management platform that will assist Aggregators (or other relevant Stakeholders involved in DR business scenarios) in their decision making mechanisms over their portfolios of prosumers. This novel architecture incorporates multiple strategies and policies provided from energy market stakeholders, establishing a more modular and future-proof DR solution. By employing an innovative multi-agent decision making system and self-learning algorithms to enable aggregation, segmentation and coordination of several diverse clusters, consisting of supply and demand assets, a fully autonomous design will be delivered. This DR framework is further fortified in terms of data security by not only implementing cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, but also by making use of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps) which will further secure and facilitate Aggregators-to-Prosumers transactions. The blockchain technologies will be combined with well-known open protocols (i.e. OpenADR) towards also supporting interoperability in terms of information exchange.

AB The capability of executing so-called smart contracts in a decentralised manner is one of the compelling features of modern blockchains. Smart contracts are fully. edged programs which cannot be changed once deployed to the blockchain. They typically implement the business logic of distributed apps and carry billions of dollars worth of coins. In that respect, it is imperative that smart contracts are correct and have no vulnerabilities or bugs. However, research has identified different classes of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, some of which led to prominent multi-million dollar fraud cases.
   In this paper we focus on vulnerabilities related to integer bugs, a class of bugs that is particularly difficult to avoid due to some characteristics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Solidity programming language. In this paper we introduce OSIRIS - a framework that combines symbolic execution and taint analysis, in order to accurately find integer bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. Osiris detects a greater range of bugs than existing tools, while providing a better specificity of its detection. We have evaluated its performance on a large experimental dataset containing more than 1.2 million smart contracts. We found that 42,108 contracts contain integer bugs. Besides being able to identify several vulnerabilities that have been reported in the past few months, we were also able to identify a yet unknown critical vulnerability in a couple of smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

AB In the Tor anonymity network, the distribution of topology information relies on the correct behavior of five out of the nine trusted directory authority servers. This centralization is concerning since a powerful adversary might compromise these servers and conceal information about honest nodes, leading to the full de-anonymization of all Tor users. Our work aims at distributing the work of these trusted authorities, such increasing resilience against attacks on core infrastructure components of the Tor network. In particular, we leverage several emerging technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, and trusted execution environments to design and prototype a system called SmarTor. This system replaces the directory authorities with a smart contract and a distributed network of untrusted entities responsible for bandwidth measurements. We prototyped SmarTor using Ethereum smart contracts and Intel SGX secure hardware. In our evaluation, we show that SmarTor produces significantly more reliable and precise measurements compared to the current measurement system. Overall, our solution improves the decentralization of the Tor network, reduces trust assumptions and increases resilience against powerful adversaries like law enforcement and intelligence services.

ID ATTACKS
AB Bitcoin provides only pseudo-anonymous transactions, which can be exploited to link payers and payees - defeating the goal of anonymous payments. To thwart such attacks, several Bitcoin mixers have been proposed, with the objective of providing unlinkability between payers and payees. However, existing Bitcoin mixers can be regarded as either insecure or inefficient.
   We present OBSCURO, a highly efficient and secure Bitcoin mixer that utilizes trusted execution environments (TEEs). With the TEE's confidentiality and integrity guarantees for code and data, our mixer design ensures the correct mixing operations and the protection of sensitive data (i.e., private keys and mixing logs), ruling out coin theft and address linking attacks by a malicious service provider. Yet, the TEE-based implementation does not prevent the manipulation of inputs (e.g., deposit submissions, blockchain feeds) to the mixer, hence OBSCURO is designed to overcome such limitations: it (1) offers an indirect deposit mechanism to prevent a malicious service provider from rejecting benign user deposits; and (2) scrutinizes blockchain feeds to prevent deposits from being mixed more than once (thus degrading anonymity) while being eclipsed from the main blockchain branch. In addition, OBSCURO provides several unique anonymity features (e.g., minimum mixing set size guarantee, resistant to dropping user deposits) that are not available in existing centralized and decentralized mixers.
   Our prototype of OBSCURO is built using Intel SGX and we demonstrate its effectiveness in Bitcoin Testnet. Our implementation mixes 1000 inputs in just 6.49 seconds, which vastly outperforms all of the existing decentralized mixers.

AB Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.
   This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.

ID FUTURE
AB Purpose - The cyber security industry emerged rapidly in recent years due to mounting cyber threats and increasing cyber hacking activities. Research on emerging technologies emphasizes the risks and sometimes neglects to address the potential positive contribution to cyber security. The purpose of this study is to conduct a relatively balanced long-term foresight study to elicit major significant threat drivers and to identify emerging technologies that are likely to have a significant impact on defense and attack capabilities in cyber security.
   Design/methodology/approach - The main instruments used in this study were horizon scanning and an online survey among subject-matter experts that assessed emerging threats and the potential impact of several emerging technologies on cyber defense capabilities and cyber attack capabilities.
   Findings - An expert survey shows that cyber resilience, homomorphic encryption and blockchain may be considered as technologies contributing mainly to defense capabilities. On the other hand, Internet of Things, biohacking and human machine interface (HMI) and autonomous technologies add mainly to attack capabilities. In the middle, we find autonomous technologies, quantum computing and artificial intelligence that contribute to defense, as well as to attack capabilities, with roughly similar impact on both.
   Originality/value - This study adds to the current research a balanced long-term view and experts' assessment of negative and positive impacts of emerging technologies, including their time to maturity and consensus levels. Two new Likert scale measures were applied to measure the potential impact of emerging technologies on cyber security, thus enabling the classification of the results into four groups (net positive, net negative, positive-positive and negative-negative).

DE Blockchain; Ethereum; Smart contracts; State of knowledge
AB Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. A peer-to-peer network of mutually distrusting nodes maintains a common view of the global state and executes code upon request. The stated is stored in a blockchain secured by a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to that in Bitcoin. The core value proposition of Ethereum is a full-featured programming language suitable for implementing complex business logic.
   Decentralized applications without a trusted third party are appealing in areas like crowdfunding, financial services, identity management, and gambling. Smart contracts are a challenging research topic that spans over areas ranging from cryptography, consensus algorithms, and programming languages to governance, finance, and law.
   This paper summarizes the state of knowledge in this field. We provide a technical overview of Ethereum, outline open challenges, and review proposed solutions. We also mention alternative smart contract blockchains.

ID INNOVATION
AB Thanks to the new technologies such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing or blockchain, the sources of international competitiveness shift towards better social and emotional skills of workforce as well as more advanced cognitive capabilities, such as logical reasoning or creativity. Some authors emphasize the role of economic creativity. It has been proved that more economic creativity leads to greater innovation implementation. Therefore we study what factors have influence on creativity and consequently the success of nations in the international competition in the era driven by new forms of automation. We point at the role of culture and we verify the influence of particular national cultural dimensions on creativity using correlation and regression analyses. We found that countries with higher level of Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance or Masculinity show lower level of creative outputs. On the contrary, with higher level of both Individualism and Long-term Orientation, the level of creative outputs increases.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Customer(1) service plays an important role in gaining income for organizations. It is a knowledge intensive process that relies heavily on well-trained or experienced employees. Recently, automated customer service is emerging. It can help organizations reduce operation and training costs. They apply machine learning to big data to provide automated or semi-automated customer service. However, most startups or small and medium enterprises do not have sufficient data and knowledge. As a result, they still rely on customer service personnel or use automated customer service provided by third parties. Therefore, it is difficult for them to develop their own core customer service competency. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based AutoML framework that aims to provide an open environment for data trading. The architecture, dataflow, and key elements are presented and discussed. The framework not only helps organizations that do not have sufficient training data and knowledge to provide automated customer services, but also maintains continuous updates and learning in a reduced cost and risk.

AB The block(1) chain is an important supporting technology of bitcoin, and there are many applications based on block chain. This paper reports a novel technology that uses block chain to construct the library circulation system, and analyzes the advantages and characteristics of the system. The system frame and structure of the library circulation system are designed based on the block chain technology, and the core technology and solution during the implementation are analyzed. In this paper we applied the block chain technology to the Library Circulation System, and proposed a new idea for system design and implementation based on block chain technology.

AB Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) technology defines standards to deliver real-time services such as voice and video over LTE based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) networks. The security implementation in VoLTE is End-to-Access (e2a), which means that the sessions are only encrypted between the mobile terminals and the IMS network. In this paper we propose a new approach for securing End-to-End (e2e) VoLTE media based the Ethereum Blockchain. The solution consists of creating public and private keypairs for VoLTE user equipments (UEs) and storing the public keys in the Ethereum Blockchain. The media is encrypted e2e using the Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) protocol with a variety of session key distribution mechanisms. Results showed that the solution implementation has minimal impact on the existing IMS network, and the secure call setup time between two terminals is negligible compared to the original VoLTE setup time.

AB The state-of-the-art mobile edge applications are generating intense traffic and posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resource sharing across multiple service providers today requires a centralized, trusted repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status. We propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge application placement decisions for multiple service providers, based on a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for mobile edge application placement scenarios. All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by every mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes resources at the mobile edge.

AB Residential AC Nano-PV Systems (NPV) are less than 10 kW solar PV systems that can generate, store, control and import or export electrical power from/to the Grid. At the core of these systems are Energy Routers which are hardware/software components that allow control of the system's generators (e.g., solar PV panels), energy storage devices, and loads. In this paper, we review AC NPV design considerations for residential systems, including short-term load prediction for constant power generation, and security issues. Also, we note some of the upcoming technologies of interest in this application such as blockchain.

AB Electricity has been delivered from high voltage centralized power generating plants to low voltage users based on physics theory. It will not be sustainable when more and more decentralized energy has been installed to the society. To manage millions generation sites, the energy delivery system based on market mechanisms can be an answerr. In this paper, we propose a platform that exchange power between individual consumers using digitalgrid technology and blockchain that can digitally control power.

AB Security of the Internet of Things represents a field that strongly attracts academia and industry since it represents one of the main obstacles in its adoption. In this area, authentication and authorization methods holds a golden place in priority rank. Indeed, current approaches suffers from numerous limits. Moreover, generally, deployment systems use separately two methods one dedicated to the authentication and the other to the authorization, while the number of methods that combine both requirements is limited. In this work we propose an adaptive blockchain based authentication and authorization approach for IoT use cases. We provided a real implementation of our approach using Java language. The extensive evaluation provided, shows clearly the ability of our scheme in meeting the different requirements, as well as its ability in ensuring a very lightweight cost.

AB In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin holds the first place in terms of market cap and currency price, which makes it the first target and victim of attack attempts. Indeed, there are various attacks against cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular, e.g., block withholding, transaction malleability and the Eclipse attack- The latter, allows an attacker to completely isolate a peer and to monopolize all permanent connections front/to the victim. However, in this attack, the non permanent connections, remains non monopolized by the attacker, which can disturb the attack success. In this paper, we propose (I) a characterization of the misbehavior mechanism applied by Bitcoin and its weaknesses; and (2) a new method to realize the Eclipse attack which monopolizes all the peer's connections, even the non permanent ones, with a minimal number of IP addresses. Our characterization and attack realization, were performed on the main Bitcoin network and on a real client.

AB Blockchain networks have been claimed to have the potential of fundamentally changing the way humans perform economic transactions with each other. In such networks, trust-enabling agents and activities, that were traditionally arranged in a centralized fashion, are replaced by a network of nodes which collectively yet independently witness and establish the non-repudiability of transactions. Most often, a proof-of-work (PoW) requirement ensures that participants invest resources for joining the network, incentivizing conformance to the network rules, while making it highly infeasible for malicious agents to construct an alternative version of the transaction history. While research on security and efficiency aspects of blockchain networks is already being conducted, there is still work to be done to understand how different external and internal conditions guarantee or threaten their sustainability, i.e., their continuous operation. Focusing on public PoW-based blockchain platforms, in this paper we sketch an abstract model that is aimed at supporting comprehension and qualitative reasoning about the factors that affect sustainability of a blockchain network.

AB Anti-detection is becoming as an emerging challenge for anti-phishing. This paper solves the threats of anti-detection from the threshold setting condition. Enough webpages are considered to complicate threshold setting condition when the threshold is settled. According to the common visual behavior which is easily attracted by the salient region of webpages, image retrieval methods based on texton correlation descriptor (TCD) are improved to obtain enough webpages which have similarity in the salient region for the images of webpages. There are two steps for improving TCD which has advantage of recognizing the salient region of images: (1) This paper proposed Weighted Euclidean Distance based on neighborhood location (NLW-Euclidean distance) and double cross windows, and combine them to solve the problems in TCD; (2) Space structure is introduced to map the image set to Euclid space so that similarity relation among images can be used to complicate threshold setting conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of anti-phishing and make the system more stable, and significantly reduce the possibilities of being hacked to be used as mining systems for blockchain.

DE Blockchain; incentives; crowdsourcing; Web indexing
AB Four major search engines, Google in particular, hold a unique position in enabling the use of the Internet, as they alone direct over 98% of Internet users to the content they seek, using proprietary indices. While the contribution of these companies is undeniable, their design is necessarily affected by their economic interests, which may or may not align with those of the users, raising concerns regarding their effect on the availability of information around the globe. While multiple academic and commercial projects aimed to distribute and democratize the Web search, they failed to gain much traction, mostly due to inferior results and lack of incentives for participation. In this paper, we show how complex networking-intensive tasks can be crowdsourced using Bitcoin's incentive model. We present Webcoin, a novel distributed digital-currency which utilizes networking resources rather then computational, and can only be mined through Web indexing. Webcoin provides both the incentives and the means to create Google-scale indices, freely available to competing services and the public. Webcoin's design overcomes numerous unique challenges, such as index verification, scalability, and nodes' ability to actively manipulate webpages. We deploy 200 fully-functioning Webcoin nodes and demonstrate their low bandwidth requirements.

AB The gaming industry is affected by two key issues-cheating and DDoS attacks against game servers. In this paper, we aim to present a novel yet concrete application of the blockchain technology to address the seemingly disparate problems. Our approach uses blockchain to manage definitive game state and exploits peer consensus on every player action to track modifications to tangible player assets. While a key impediment to adopting blockchain for real-time systems is its high per-operation latency, our approach leverages several optimizations to enable real-time prevention of a large class of cheats where the reported client state is inconsistent with the observed state at the server. Further, blockchain-based games leverage the robust peer-to-peer architecture to successfully defend against DDoS attacks.
   Our strategy enables flexibility to customize games with minimum modifications to game clients by porting server-side logic to smart contracts that execute atop peers. We evaluate our approach on a recent port of the multi-player game Doom. Our prototype can scale to client tickrates matched by modern games, and prevent cheats in <150ms for 32 peers deployed across the Internet, which is well within the latency requirements for online gaming.

AB Nowadays, in order to support flexibility, agility, and ubiquitous accessibility among vehicles, software defined networking has been proposed to integrate with vehicular networks, known as software defined vehicular network (SDVN). Due to a variety of data, flows, and vehicles in SDVN, a distributed SDVN is necessary. However, how to reach consensus in distributed SDVN efficiently and safely is an intractable problem. In this paper, we use a permissioned blockchain approach to reach consensus in distributed SDVN. The existing permissioned blockchain has a number of drawbacks, such as low throughput. We virtualize the underlying resources (e.g., computing resources and networking resources), jointly considering the trust features of blockchain nodes to improve the throughput. Accordingly, we formulate view change, computing resources allocation, and networking resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. In order to solve this joint problem, we use a novel deep Q-learning approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

DE Cloud Storage; VCG mechanism; Smart Contract; Security; Erasure Coding
AB Since the security and fault tolerance is the two important metrics of the data storage, it brings both opportunities and challenges for distributed data storage and transaction. The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in, single point failure risk, DDoS attack and information security. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed transaction method for cloud storage based on smart contract. First, to guarantee the fault tolerance and decrease the storing cost for erasure coding, a VCG-based auction mechanism is proposed for storage transaction, and we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem - how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment. Based on private chain of Ethereum, we make the simulations for proposed storage transaction method. The results showed that proposed transaction model can realize competitive trading of storage resources, and ensure the safe and economic operation of resource trading.

AB The blockchain represents emerging technologies and future trends. For the traditional social organization and mode of operation, the development of the blockchain is a revolution. As a decentralized infrastructure and distributed general ledger agreement, the blockchain presents us with a great opportunity to establish data security and trust for automation and intelligence development in the Internet of Things (IoT) and it creates a new un-centralized programmable smart ecosystem. Our research synthesizes and analyses extant articles that focus on blockchain-related perspectives which will potentially play an important role in sustainable development in the world. Blockchain applications and future directions always attract more attention. Blockchain technology provides strong scalability and interoperability between the intelligent and the physical worlds.

ID FUTURE
AB Blockchain is disrupting the banking industry and contributing to the increased big data in banking. However, there exists a gap in research and development into blockchain-ed big data in banking from an academic perspective, and this gap is expected to have a significant negative impact on the adoption and development of blockchain technology for banking. In hope of motivating more active engagement by academics, researchers and bankers alike, we present the most comprehensive review of the impact of blockchain in banking to date by summarizing the opportunities and challenges from a bankers perspective. In addition, we also discuss the impact that big data from blockchain will have on banking data analytics in future and show the increasing importance of filtering and signal extraction for the banking industry. Whilst there is evidence of selected banks adopting blockchain technology in isolation or small groups, we find the need for extensive research and development into several aspects of banking with blockchain to overcome the challenges which are currently hindering its adoption in banking across the globe.

AB The emerging Internet of Things needs edge-computing - this is an established fact. In turn, edge computing needs infrastructure decentralisation. What is not necessarily established yet is that infrastructure decentralisation needs a distributed model of Internet governance and decentralised trust schemes. We discuss the features of a decentralised IoT and edge-computing ecosystem and list the components that need to be designed, as well the challenges that need to be addressed.

AB Existing service ecosystems typically rely on some centralized service registries (e.g., ProgrammableWeb. com) as "middle people" to record service behaviors thus to provide service ranking and recommendation. Excessive centralization increasingly becomes the bottleneck and hinders the further growth of the service ecosystems. As the first attempt to apply the fundamental technique underneath the emerging Bitcoin network into the field of service oriented computing, this paper proposes to build a service ecosystem as a decentralized blockchain-oriented service network, called Decentralized Service Eco-System (DSES). Whenever any activity occurs in the system (e.g., APIs are used together in a published mashup), all involved parties will individually store and maintain a copy of the detailed record (provenance) at their local databases. Such a distributed database-oriented solution will enable services who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. In this way, service discovery and recommendation can be realized in a distributed manner that promises higher scalability and maintainability. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system of DSES is constructed using the real-world data from ProgrammableWeb. com, based on the INKchain, a newly open-source consortium blockchain mechanism extending the Hyperledger Fabric.

TI On Building Efficient Temporal Indexes on Hyperledger Fabric

AB We discuss the problem of constructing efficient temporal indexes on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular Blockchain platform. The temporal nature of the data inserted by Fabric transactions can be leveraged to support various use-cases. This requires that temporal queries be processed efficiently on this data. Currently this presents significant challenges as this data is organized on file-system, is exposed via limited API and does not support temporal indexes.
   In a prior work [1], we presented two models for creating temporal indexes on Fabric which overcome these limitations and improve the performance of temporal queries on Fabric. The first model creates a copy of each event inserted and stores temporally close events together on Fabric. The second model keeps the event count intact but tags metadata to each event s.t. temporally close events share the same metadata.
   In this paper, we present variants on these two models which are better able to handle the skew present in Fabric data. We discuss the details and show that these variants significantly outperform the approaches presented in [1] when Fabric data contains skew. We also discuss the performance tradeoffs among these variants across various dimensions - data storage, query performance, event insertion time etc.

AB Maintaining data provenance in cloud in a tamper-resistant manner that cannot be breached by malicious parties is a necessity from the current security standpoint. Blockchain technology has emerged as a secure solution to store and share information by offering an immutable distributed ledger service. Its effectiveness hinges on the infrastructure supporting the distributed ledger and consensus protocol that governs the validity of entries in the Blockchain. Hence, Blockchain can be a potential candidate to implement data provenance; however, traditional cryptocurrency-based consensus models become a bottleneck in the cloud environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain based data provenance architecture (BlockCloud) that incorporates a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based consensus protocol (CloudPoS) for securely recording the data operations occurring in cloud environment. The critical operational phases of the protocol are discussed in depth, which leverages the cloud users' cyber infrastructure resources. A cloud-based testbed environment is created using a local cluster of physical machines managed by Xen hypervisor. Resource elasticity is enabled using Kubernetes setup that interacts with the dockerized containers, which emulate as peers in the Blockchain network. We then evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol in a simulated environment and conduct performance tests of the proposed consensus.

AB Business interest in blockchain technology is increasing due the potential for change that it offers. Large scale adoption in enterprise IT environments brings about a need for service management and DevOps processes for blockchain deployments. Nodes in the network may fail or be taken down for maintenance requiring visibility across hybrid, traditional, cloud enabled and cloud native deployments. Service management is necessary to ease deployment woes for those looking to install code within their own data centers on-premises or on dedicated cloud servers and further to handle the life cycle of the deployments that includes security patches, critical updates, upgrades, change management and restarting services. In this paper, we provide a mechanism to optimally perform such operations with no disruption to the consensus and transactions for such emerging blockchain applications.

ID SCHEME
AB As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-toend privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.

   software development
AB To ensure integrity, trust, immutability and authenticity of software and information (cyber data, user data and attack event data) in a collaborative environment, research is needed for cross-domain data communication, global software collaboration, sharing, access auditing and accountability. Blockchain technology can significantly automate the software export auditing and tracking processes. It allows to track and control what data or software components are shared between entities across multiple security domains. Our blockchain-based solution relies on role-based and attribute-based access control and prevents unauthorized data accesses. It guarantees integrity of provenance data on who updated what software module and when. Furthermore, our solution detects data leakages, made behind the scene by authorized blockchain network participants, to unauthorized entities. Our approach is used for data forensics/provenance, when the identity of those entities who have accessed/updated/transferred the sensitive cyber data or sensitive software is determined. All the transactions in the global collaborative software development environment are recorded in the blockchain public ledger and can be verified any time in the future. Transactions can not be repudiated by invokers. We also propose modified transaction validation procedure to improve performance and to protect permissioned IBM Hyperledger-based blockchains from DoS attacks, caused by bursts of invalid transactions.

DE blockchain; RTGS; inter-bank payment; Hyperledger
AB Real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) is the cornerstone of inter-bank payment business. Spectacular expansion of large-value wholesale payment has forced financial institutions to implement inter-bank payment systems (IBPS) with higher level of throughput, security, and stability. This promising approach to orchestrating IBPS utilizes emerging blockchain technology, which has been successfully harnessed to deliver distributed trust and confidentiality for diverse financial service applications. However, blockchain is not a silver bullet for IBPS, which faces multiple challenges incurred by high value transactions. Financial institutions expect not only a simple migration from traditional RTGS to a blockchain platform, but a decentralized system with better confidentiality, instruction settlement finality, liquidity saving mechanism, and more efficient methods of gridlock resolution. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end IBPS prototype based on Hyperledger Fabric enterprise blockchain platform. The prototype supports gross settlement, gridlock resolution, and reconciliation for inter-bank payment business. As a preliminary research of Ubin Project, this prototype is proved to provide higher level of payment settlement service.

DE pseudonymous schemes; homomorphic encryption; blockchain; privacy;
   auditing
AB Personal data are often collected and processed in a decentralized fashion, within different contexts. For instance, with the emergence of distributed applications, several providers are used to correlate their records, to provide personalized services to their clients. As such, to protect users' privacy, different pseudonyms are generally used for different contexts. These pseudonyms have to be unlinkable to prevent identifying records to be associated to the same user. Although unlinkable, these pseudonyms have to be processed and exchanged according to their owners' consent and in a privacy-preserving fashion. In this paper, we propose BDUA, a new Blockchain-based Data Usage Auditing system, that ensures a controlled yet privacy preserving exchange of distributed data, such that a set of authorized auditing entities are able to conduct an accurate auditing relying on registered blockchains' transactions.

DE Blockchain; Bitcoin; Ethereum; Verifiable Computing
AB Outsourcing a computation has been a major research area in cryptography. A delegator (D) outsources a computation to a worker (W), who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. The delegator has to verify the output returned, to guard against malicious or malfunctioning worker. The worker may not trust the delegator to pay for computations performed by him. Blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer public verifiability of transactions generated in their networks. These transactions are of the form of a set of opcodes in Bitcoins or initiate execution of a contract in Ethereum, thus offering execution of small programs publicly. A fair protocol for verifiable computation between two parties D and W must provide the following guarantee: (1) Fast verification: The work performed to verify the correctness of output of a function is less than the work performed to compute function. (2) Pay to learn output: W obtains pay from D iff D received the correct output of the computation from W.
   In this work, we design two ideal functionalities F*(CRR) for single worker case and F*(CCRR) for multiple workers case. Existing methods do not allow Mutual revocation of deposit transaction which reduces the cost of script execution. Our ideal functionalities offer mutual revocation of the deposit transaction made by D. We show the realization of our ideal functionality F*(CRR) in Bitcoin, and we also discuss fair protocols for verifiable computations of GCD of two large numbers and optimization problems. As our final work, we show a fair protocol for proofbased verifiable computing schemes.

AB While blockchains and smart contracts are primarily known for their use as the technologies underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, these technologies also have applicability in other areas. In this paper, we present an application of smart contracts running on a permissioned distributed ledger (essentially a private blockchain where only credentialed participants are allowed to read and write) to managing tenant and service accounts in a cloud computing data center. The system is called Saranyu and it supports four services: identity management, authentication, authorization, and charging. Identity management and authentication are handled using client-generated public/private key pairs in the usual fashion. Authorization is handled as a contract from a grantee of service access rights to a recipient which is a tenant or other service. Charging is supported by Saranyu integration with payment gateways for payments related to service resource usage. We describe an implementation of Saranyu on top of the Quorum blockchain system. We believe the security, non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and easy transaction history access brought by blockchain technology will increase transparency and trust in cloud tenant and service management and that the fundamentally distributed nature of the blockchain will make Saranyu an excellent match with developing distributed cloud architectures.

DE Blockchain; Hierarchical Ledger; Log tampering; Log storage
AB During the normal operation of a Cloud solution, no one usually pays attention to the logs except technical department, which may periodically check them to ensure that the performance of the platform conforms to the Service Level Agreements. However, the moment the status of a component changes from acceptable to unacceptable, or a customer complains about accessibility or performance of a platform, the importance of logs increases significantly. Depending on the scope of the issue, all departments, including management, customer support, and even the actual customer, may turn to logs to find out what has happened, how it has happened, and who is responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be motivated to tamper the logs to hide their fault. Given the number of logs that are generated by the Cloud solutions, there are many tampering possibilities. While tamper detection solution can be used to detect any changes in the logs, we argue that critical nature of logs calls for immutability. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, that collects the logs from different providers and avoids log tampering by sealing the logs cryptographically and adding them to a hierarchical ledger, hence, providing an immutable platform for log storage.

AB Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time. In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchain-based application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election.

AB This work presents ChainFS, a middleware system that secures cloud storage services using a minimally trusted Blockchain. ChainFS hardens the cloud-storage security against forking attacks. The ChainFS middleware exposes a file-system interface to end users. Internally, ChainFS stores data files in the cloud and exports minimal and necessary functionalities to the Blockchain for key distribution and file operation logging. We implement the ChainFS system on Ethereum and S3FS and closely integrate it with FUSE clients and Amazon S3 cloud storage. We measure the system performance and demonstrate low overhead.

AB Distributed Ledger technology and its most notable implementation, the Blockchain, is disrupting today's industry in extremely fast pace with a potential to change the world. The security posture of Blockchain remains one of a key topics in today's industry and distributed services. On and on, we can embrace the attempts to implement the Blockchain technology in sensitive areas of our daily life like finance [1], insurance services [2], health care [3] etc. It is therefore crucial raise awareness of its limitations, possible improvements, as well as embedded compensations. In this paper, we provide a holistic view on the security aspects of the Blockchain technology. We identify the most notable security threats applicable in the above context and reveal technology-specific challenges, that need to be taken into account. Our analysis lists the security features already embedded in the Blockchain and sample uses in nowadays industry. Our results lead to several observations, recommendations, and open points that could be considered in ongoing development of the technology.

AB In order to ensure faster audits, higher transparency and security, many applications are being designed using blockchains. We propose BlockStore, a decentralized storage framework using blockchain technology. The primary motivation is efficient utilization of storage resources of users. Users often have un-utilized or underutilized storage in their devices. They can choose to host their storage resources when they are not in use. Users rent storage from the host for a fee for a fixed period of time and release back after the time expires. BlockStore keeps track of un-utilized storage of hosts in Space Wallet, a structure that helps in assigning storage to renters on request. The ownership of storage can be proved by logging all storage transactions in a public ledger (the blockchain), which can be verified by any user. A host cannot host the same storage to two users at the same time, nor can it tamper with the data of the renter. Renters cannot frame a host of cheating. BlockStore uses proofs of storage and data possession to verify that the hosts do not tamper with data and penalizes parties for misbehavior. Users can encrypt data for privacy. Payment and penalty are handled using smart contracts. BlockStore differs from existing solutions, by providing stronger audit that detects and penalizes misbehaving parties earlier than existing schemes.

AB Expectation of cryptocurrencies has been increased rapidly and all of these cryptocurrencies are generated on blockchain platform. This means not only the paradigm is changing in the field of finance but also the blockchain platform is technically stable. Based on the stability of blockchain, many kind of crypto currencies or application platforms are being implemented or released and world famous banks are applying blockchain on their financial service[1]. Even law for exchanging cryptocurrencies is being discussed. Furthermore, blockchain platforms also run programmed source code which is called as smart contract on its distributed platform. Smart contract extends usage of blockchain platform. So in this paper, we propose an algorithm for recording and managing location data of IoT service provider and user based on blockchain with smart contract. Our proposal records data of participants in network by blockchain which ensures security and match with other optimized participant by spatial data processing.

AB Fog computing has emerged due to the problem that it becomes difficult to store every data to the cloud system as the number of Internet of Things increases. In this fog computing, a vast amount of data generated from the Internet of Things is transmitted to the cloud system located at a remote place, and is processed by a fog computer such as a sensor or a router located nearby, so that only the necessary data is transmitted to the cloud system. However, the above-mentioned fog computer has some drawbacks like being shut down due to an attack by a malicious user in advance, and a method of processing when a fog computer is down or restored. In this paper we describe a fog computing with blockchain that enables fog computers to share transaction generated by processing transaction information of a device controlled by a blockchain method to a security and device control method of a fog computer utilizing the technology. Furthemore by using security properties of blockchain such as authentication, non-repudiation and data integrity, fog computing using blockchain has advantage of security comparing to previous Cloud and fog computing system using centralized database or P2P networks.

AB Application of IoT (Internet of Things) is expanding rapidly as internet connects things in our homes and our personal devices and even our body, provides ease, entertainment and comfort to our daily lives. However, as everything personal is connected, security and privacy becomes a major challenge. Blockchain-based IoT can provide a completely trusted and transparent environment with its tamper-resistant data structure, timestamp, data encryption and distributed consensus. Since cryptocurrency is the first application of blockchains, most blockchain mechanisms like Ethereum provides token-based peer-to-peer payment system that allows payment using a custom currency which enables IoT devices to pay or receive token without a third-party inclusion. In this paper we proposed to apply blockchain mechanism to education/discipline of children at home by through token-based parental control in which parent can encourage good behaviors and discourage bad behaviors of children via tokens transferred via blockchain network. Current parental control is implemented in operating systems of smartphones that only prohibits the abuse of smartphone games or inappropriate web sites. However, this token-based parental control pay tokens to children with good behaviors that allow them to play or watch the proper contents as their rewards. Devices at home like television and computer are connected to the blockchain and accessible only when the user have a sufficient amount of tokens. Children are given incentives in term of token by their parents if they do their homework properly or help their parents. Besides that, smart contract feature in Ethereum allows application to be programmed in a blockchain enables monitoring the activities of children through blockchain. This paper introduces the design of the token-based parental control by using smart contract schemes of Ethereum blockchain with a simple smart home setup as a proof of concept.

DE Blockchain; smart contract; parallel model
AB With the rapid development of blockchain technology, blockchain becomes a good platform for execution of smart contracts. However, since smart contracts still have a low performance of transaction processing on blockchain. It can't satisfy real-time requirements in some situations. This paper proposes a parallel smart contract model on blockchain which has a better performance in transaction processing. The challenges with the proposed approach are the implementation of the parallel mode and the solution of synchronization problem of the proposed model. This paper uses multi-thread technology to implement the proposed model where transactions are executed in parallel. Then we propose a transaction splitting algorithm to resolve the synchronization problem. Finally, experimental analysis proves that this parallel model exactly makes a remarkable development of performance in transaction processing.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices present different security challenges that have not been addressed yet and there is no clear commitment from stakeholders to do so. Such problems have become evident and IoT devices are targets of malicious actors that employ them as instruments to fulfill their nefarious purposes. Recent attacks to major Internet services have shown the real damage vulnerable devices can make when compromised. Many of the endangered devices sit in home-based environments with users that are not familiar with security or network best practices, which make them easy targets for bad actors. Therefore, there exists the need to find practical solutions using existing technologies that have been, so far, proven to be efficient, such as the blockchain. This paper implements a proof of concept to secure consumer/home-based IoT devices and the networks around them using blockchain technology powered by Ethereum. The results obtained support the idea of a whitelisting application based on the Ethereum protocol.

AB Over the past few decades, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been an important factor in securing products along the agri-food supply chain. However, there still exist security vulnerabilities when registering products to a specific RFID tag, particularly regarding the ease at which tags can be cloned. In this paper, a potential attack, labeled the 'Hilt Shao attack', is identified which could occur during the initial phases of product registration, and demonstrate the type of attack using unique identification (UID) and changeable unique identification (CUID) tags.

AB This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based technique for creating an environment where individuals can be the custodians of their official education records and can easily share those records with others. A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, open record of all cryptographic data exchanges. One key characteristic of the blockchain is its decentralized nature. Unlike records or accounts maintained by department, college, university, government agencies and other institutions, the blockchain does not require an intermediary to complete education records or alter records. Our solution incorporating the advanced features of blockchain allows education providers to issue official certificates that supply proof of completion or achievement. The proposed framework could also provide the corresponding functions for the after-college education and many other further usages.

AB The advent of Blockchain Technology allows us to develop a Decentralized Application called DApp on peer-to-peer network, which can harden changes of contracts in the DApp and denial of service (DoS) attacks to the DApp. We reengineer an App to a DApp allowing smart contracts, and compare the given legacy App and the target DApp. We conclude that DApp is not a separate application but a complementary application of the current App by comparing their architectures.

AB The electricity market is undergoing a transformation with increasing number of electric vehicles (EV). This paper studies the current charging and discharging schemes for EV and the feasibility of the decentralized transactional energy market. In order to adapt the high volume of EV integration and fully decentralize the grid system, the blockchain technology is introduced to serve as an envision for the next generation grid. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain technology enabled electricity exchange market to enable EVs' autonomy in trading energy with secured distributed energy transactions. The constructed exchange market is price competitive platform where the best bid price is modelled via the jump-diffusion process to enable users to participate in the trading process. We demonstrate that our proposed distributed energy exchange system can perform the peer-to-peer transaction with the real-time electricity price aligning with the EV power demand trend without requiring a third-party intermediary.

AB This paper tackles today's unprecedented challenges of enabling and stimulating multiple energy stakeholders to have a more active participation in the smart grid electricity market. The research extends the existing four archetypes of orchestrator-driven business models for the electricity market and proposes a fifth type of electricity market, the Blockchain Marketplace. The key novelty of the paper is to expand the electricity market architecture and design from centralization and pseudo-decentralization to full decentralization, enabled by the blockchain. The study not only broadens the smart grid and electricity market literature but also contributes to the theoretical development of the business model and organization study domains with a systemic approach.

DE Ethereum; Blockchain; Query Language; SQL
AB Blockchains store a massive amount of heterogeneous data which will only grow in time. When searching for data on the Ethereum platform, one is required to either access the records (blocks) directly by using a unique identifier, or sequentially search several records to find the desired information. Therefore, we propose the Ethereum Query Language (EQL), a query language that allows users to retrieve information from the blockchain by writing SQL-like queries. The queries provide a rich syntax to specify data elements to search information scattered through several records. We claim that EQL makes it easier to search, acquire, format, and present information from the blockchain.

DE Ethereum; Solidity; smart contracts; static analysis; bug detection
AB Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being "The DAO", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area.
   We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them(1). SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues.

AB Blockchain-driven technologies are considered disruptive because of the availability of dis-intermediated, censorship-resistant and tamper-proof digital platforms of distributed trust. Among these technologies, smart contract platforms have the potential to take over functions usually done by intermediaries like banks, escrow or legal services. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol aiming to execute smart contracts as part of a blockchain transaction validation. We enable extensions in the execution of smart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy, correctness and verifiability. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented, since no communication between participants is requested, and contract validations do not imply the re-execution of the code by all the nodes in the network. However, proofs of correct execution are stored on the blockchain and can be verified by multiple parties. Our solution is based on programming tools which optimize the time execution and the required memory while preserving the embedded functionality.

AB Blockchain technology becomes the key solution to provide trust and security without any need for a central supervisory authority to validate the transactions. By now, it plays a key role in the digital transformation of several processes and industries with varying application use cases. To promote the wide adoption of blockchain technology we need mechanisms to identify the digitizabiity level of the given regulations to smart contracts and mechanisms to specify which blockchain technology is best suitable for the given regulations. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that supports the automated analysis of human-readable regulation representations by suggesting how much percentage of regulation is digitizable and the suitable blockchain environment to design the application. We identify smart contract components that correspond to real-world entities and its pertaining clauses and its digitizabiity property. With selected examples, we explore this capability and discuss our future research directions on smart contract generation according to the recommended environment.

AB Recently, there has been a growing interest in using online technologies to design protocols for secure electronic voting. The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers.
   In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol(1). Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination. The protocol is also using a shuffling technique, Circle Shuffle, to de-link voters from their submissions.

   blockchain
AB The blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms are one of the hottest topics in tech at the moment. Though most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology.
   The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts.
   As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 80% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities.

DE Blockchain; user feedback; product reviews; app reviews; app stores
AB Online portals include an increasing amount of user feedback in form of ratings and reviews. Recent research highlighted the importance of this feedback and confirmed that positive feedback improves product sales figures and thus its success. Online portals' operators act as central authorities throughout the overall review process. In the worst case, operators can exclude users from submitting reviews, modify existing reviews, and introduce fake reviews by fictional users. This paper presents REVIEWCHAIN, a decentralized review approach. Our approach avoids central authorities by using blockchain technologies, decentralized apps and storage. It enables users to submit and retrieve untampered reviews. We high-light the implementation challenges encountered when realizing our approach on the public Ethereum blockchain. Then, we discuss possible design alternatives and their trade-offs regarding costs, security, and trustworthiness. Finally, we analyze which design decision should be chosen to support specific trade-offs and present resulting combinations of decentralized blockchain technologies, also with conventional centralized technologies.

AB Adding blockchain technology to existing systems instead of building them from the ground up poses several challenges. It is difficult to find out which attributes of blockchains are important for a given use case (e.g. immutable, trustless, anonymous) and to decide which elements of an architecture should employ blockchain technologies. Current approaches generally only give a hint on whether blockchain technology makes sense for a given use case or not. This paper proposes a more fine-grained approach to decide which elements of an application architecture could benefit from the use of blockchain technology. We illustrate the first outline of our approach which identifies participants, their trust relations and interactions to derive a hybrid architecture (i.e., an architecture embedding blockchain technology in existing software systems or creating new systems using blockchain only in certain parts).

AB The expansion of blockchain technologies from financial applications to other fields intensifies the problem of an increasing size of data stored in the blockchain. Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions. Approaches like IOTA, SegWit or the Lightning Network try to solve the scalability issues of blockchain applications. Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially. Following this idea use cases can be supported that require scalable blockchain technology but not necessarily an indefinite and complete transaction history.

AB Even though blockchain is mostly popular for its cryptocurrency, smart contracts have become a very prominent blockchain application. Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.

AB With the rise in worth and popularity of cryptocurrencies, a new opportunity for criminal gain is being exploited and with little currently offered in the way of defence. The cost of mining (i.e. earning cryptocurrency through CPU-intensive calculations that underpin the blockchain technology) can be prohibitively expensive, with hardware costs and electrical overheads previously offering a loss compared to the cryptocurrency gained. Off-loading these costs along a distributed network of machines via malware offers an instantly profitable scenario, though standard Anti-virus (AV) products offer some defences against file-based threats. However, newer fileless malicious attacks, occurring through the browser on seemingly legitimate websites, can easily evade detection and surreptitiously engage the victim machine in computationally-expensive cryptomining (cryptojacking).
   With no current academic literature on the dynamic opcode analysis of cryptomining, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first such experimental study. Indeed, this is the first such work presenting opcode analysis on non-executable files. Our results show that browser-based cryptomining within our dataset can be detected by dynamic opcode analysis, with accuracies of up to 100%. Further to this, our model can distinguish between cryptomining sites, weaponized benign sites, de-weaponized cryptomining sites and real world benign sites. As it is process-based, our technique offers an opportunity to rapidly detect, prevent and mitigate such attacks, a novel contribution which should encourage further future work.

AB In this paper, we propose an architecture that utilizes blockchain technology for enabling verifiable trust in collaborative health research environments. The architecture supports the human-in-the-loop paradigm for health research by establishing trust between participants, including human researchers and Al systems, by making all data transformations transparent and verifiable by all participants. We define the trustworthiness of the system and provide an analysis of the architecture in terms of trust requirements. We then evaluate our architecture by analyzing its resiliency to common security threats and through an experimental realization.

AB Currently, immutable blockchain-based ledgers become important tools for cryptocurrency transactions, auditing, smart contracts, copyright registration and many other applications. In this regard, there is a need to analyze the typical, repetitive actions written to the ledger, for example, to identify suspicious cryptocurrency transactions, a chain of events that led to information security incident, or to predict recurrence of some situation in the future. We propose to use for these purposes the algorithms for T-patterns discovering and to cluster the identified behavioral patterns subsequently. In case of having labeled patterns, clustering might be replaced by classification.

AB Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin crypto-currency system - is starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users - thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in crypto-currency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted nonmonetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.

AB A means of exchange and preservation of value is likely as old as our species. Global economic trade is often argued to be as old as trade. The question of the nature of the exchange, of who creates the value and how it is regulated is the issue. While tin from England may have reached Sumeria 4 000 years ago, or Phoenicians' ships entered the Africa area of Cape Palmas at about the same time, the problem of exchange is a central issue. Ideas of money are as diverse as the cultures that produce them, yet today global trade is experiencing modifications of the satisfaction of exchange with new platforms of electronic money. Blockchain technology is touted as foolproof, such claims have appeared in the past with various financial innovations. Such abstractions of value may not be new, but as a product of technology and complexity they create psychological novelty and a form of mesmerizing fetishism (Douglas, M. and Isherwood, B., ed.: The World of Goods: Towards an Anthropology of Consumption. Routledge, London, 1978). Manias of value are also not new, from stock (South Seas Corporation) to tulips (MacKay, C.: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Crown Press, London, 1841). The form of the mania is defined and expressed culturally but is often associated with technological change and distance of exchange of partners and clients (Baric, L.: Some aspects of credit, saving and investment in a 'non-monetary' economy (Rossel Island). In: Firth, R. and Yamey, B. S., eds.: Capital, Saving and Credit in Peasant Societies. Aldine Publishing, Chicago, pp. 35-52, 1964.). Inequality is also a feature, embedded in economic and technological disruption of trade and exchange. The role of redistribution and taxation are essential in maintaining social credit and equality. We can relate such behaviour to other systems of animal societies.

AB This paper describes an algorithm for creating hash function, resistant for quantum computer. The given approach is based on the problem of sob ing a sy stem of polynomial equations in integers, where the number of equations is less than the number of unknown parameters. The developed algorithm is parameterized so the result of the hash function depends on several parameters, therefore, it will take considerably longer to select the solution of the task. The avalanche effect is about 50%, collision is impossible because the task to find a solution of the described system of equations with a degree greater than 3 is algorithmically unsolvable. This hash function was developed for blockchain to ensure its integrity, but it can also be used in any application where a hash function is needed.

AB With the development of marine observation technology and network technology, the volume of marine data growing rapidly. This brings new challenges for data storage and transmission. How to protect data security of marine big data has become an urgent problem. The traditional information security methods' characteristic is centralization. These technologies cannot provide whole process protection, e.g., data storage, data management and application of data. The blockchain technology is a novel technology, which can keep the data security and reliability by using decentralized methodology. It has aroused wide interest in the financial field. In this paper, we describe the concept, characteristics and key technologies of blockchain technology and introduce it into the field of marine data security.

AB Circular, data-driven healthcare is increasingly being considered as an effective model to provide efficient, cost-effective and sustainable healthcare services in the future. Central to this model is the service-dominant "building-block"-type provision of care services to patients, paired with the collaboration of healthcare providers through a common infrastructure. This combination enables the forming of a decentralized, holistic care cycle. Sharing of patient medical information is pivotal towards reaching this goal; however, preserving medical record integrity and privacy, while at the same time allowing provider interoperability are often conflicting requirements. Blockchains and Smart Contracts can provide the underlying technology to support the decentralized care cycle by addressing patient privacy and medical record integrity, while simultaneously offering efficient interoperability between providers. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for a system operating within a regulated healthcare jurisdiction.

AB Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS) are highly cognitive, reflective, multitask-able, and effective in knowledge discovery. Examples of IAS include software systems that are capable of automatic reconfiguration, autonomous vehicles, network of sensors with reconfigurable sensory platforms, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) respecting privacy by deciding to turn off its camera when pointing inside a private residence. Research is needed to build systems that can monitor their environment and interactions, learn their capabilities and limitations, and adapt to meet the mission objectives with limited or no human intervention. The systems should be fail-safe and should allow for graceful degradations while continuing to meet the mission objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of our proposed new methodologies and workflows, and survey the existing approaches and new ones that can advance the science of autonomy in smart systems through enhancements in real-time control, auto-reconfigurability, monitoring, adaptability, and trust. This paper also provides the theoretical framework behind IAS.

TI A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Shard-Based Permissionless Blockchains
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Sharding; blockchain; game theory; cooperation; and incentive design
AB Low transaction throughput and poor scalability are significant issues in public blockchain consensus protocols, such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts in this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel processing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees significantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of the system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for designing appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees and prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in the protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game model of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing approach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social dilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among processors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.

AB This article is focused on the area of energy efficiency of cryptocurrencies. Nowadays, nearly two thirds of all cryptocurrencies use Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to add new blocks to blockchain network The energy sustainability of whole networks using PoW algorithm is very doubtful. Furthermore, we can see that lots of cryptocurrencies are trying to implement and move to more efficient consensus algorithms like Proof of Stake (PoS). Therefore, in this article we present three potential scenarios to perform transition between PoW and PoS.

TI COINHOARDER: Tracking a Ukrainian Bitcoin Phishing Ring DNS Style
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 APWG SYMPOSIUM ON ELECTRONIC CRIME RESEARCH

CY MAY 15-17, 2018

AB With the price of Bitcoin ascending to new heights in 2017, the rocketing valuation of cryptocurrencies continues its momentum into 2018. Evidence of the massive growth of these digital assets can be seen in the massive spikes in new clients at companies like Coinbase, adding 100,000 users in a 24-hour period, and Binance, which recently expanded its user base by 240,000 users in just one hour.
   The financial industry and Silicon Valley are not the only groups who have caught the cryptocurrency fever. Malicious actors have discovered that cryptocurrency newbies are unwitting targets that offer a consistent stream of revenue. Through our global network visibility, Cisco has observed many of these attacks originating from bulletproof hosting infrastructures located in the Eastern European region. This area is a hotbed for crypto theft and other computer crimes such as ransomware, botnets, DDoS services and credit card fraud. Some criminals have even extended beyond the digital world by kidnapping and demanding ransoms in Bitcoin, such as the case in the reported kidnapping and ransom of Pavel Lerner. Lerner was a lead analyst at Ukraine-based digital currency exchange, Exmo, who was released by his kidnappers after a $1 million Bitcoin payment was made. The event illustrates the desperate lengths some criminals will go in order to steal cryptocurrency.
   Joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in 2017, Cisco is committed to protecting these new crypto technologies. Over the past year Cisco researchers have teamed up with the Ukraine Cyber Police to track a Bitcoin phishing operation dubbed the "Coinhoarder" campaign that has been tied to the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
   Credential phishing continues to be one of the biggest security challenges for internet users, and cryptocurrency phishers have found it to be a very lucrative form of attack. In 2017, Chainalysis reported Ethereum phishing as being the number one source of theft in that ecosystem with estimates placing the total amount stolen at $115 million. Google also recently published a research paper stating credential phishing is one of their top security challenges. Cisco has been proactive in detecting phishing domains in predictive fashion to help protect our customers. Additionally, we have been working with security personnel at top cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, such as Blockchain. info and Coinbase, to help protect the cryptocurrency community members from having their tokens stolen.

AB This article is focused on central banks' responses to virtual currencies. The view about virtual currencies is different in separate regions. Even in the same country we can see not similar opinions about cryptocurrencies among different authorities. The empirical research on virtual currencies disclosed that we do not have strict rules in central banking and that this aspect creates more risks in financial system. There are central banks which prohibit financial market participants to participate in activities associated with virtual currencies while others are considering their own virtual currency or thinking about virtual currencies in foreign reserves portfolio. The bank of Lithuania plans this year to issue a digital collector coin using blockchain or other equivalent technologies. So we can see very different central banks positions all over the world. After analyzing central banks positions in various regions the conclusion can be made that in some cases national banks can face even political pressure because of financial innovations.

AB Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain.

AB The development of rural areas in the context of decentralization of power has led to the search for effective mechanisms for public administration. What is the socio-psychological profile of the inhabitants of successful self-organizing rural settlements and what management technologies are proposed for rural development? The purpose of the study is to establish and recommend a mechanism for improving the technology of territorial communities management on the example of Family Homesteads (FH). The research methodology is based on structured interviews and unstructured conversations with the inhabitants of family homesteads, the leadership of local self-government and experts in the field of rural development. The self-organization of settlements illustrates them as harmonious communities and a model of the society of the future, practicing sustainable development. It was determined that success in the development of rural areas by settlers of a new type is due to their age characteristics (average settler age 35 years), high level of education, active lifestyle and investment activity. The advantages of the practice of public administration of the territory are established with the help of blockchain technology, which allows to reduce administration costs and promote resource participation.

ID CLINICAL-TRIAL DATA; SYSTEMS; SAFETY
AB Blockchain technology alleviates the reliance on a centralized authority to certify information integrity and ownership, as well as mediate transactions and exchange of digital assets, while enabling secure and pseudoanonymous transactions along with agreements directly between interacting parties. It possesses key properties, such as immutability, decentralization, and transparency, which potentially address pressing issues in healthcare, such as incomplete records at point of care and difficult access to patients' own health information. An efficient and effective healthcare system requires interoperability, which allows software apps and technology platforms to communicate securely and seamlessly, exchange data, and use the exchanged data across health organizations and app vendors. Unfortunately, healthcare today suffers from siloed and fragmented data, delayed communications, and disparate workflow tools caused by the lack of interoperability. Blockchain offers the opportunity to enable access to longitudinal, complete, and tamper-aware medical records that are stored in fragmented systems in a secure and pseudoanonymous fashion. This chapter focuses on the applicability of Blockchain technology in healthcare by (1) identifying potential Blockchain use cases in healthcare, (2) providing a case study that implements Blockchain technology, and (3) evaluating design considerations when applying this technology in healthcare.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The intelligent vehicle communication network is prone to cyberthreats, which are difficult to solve using traditional centralized security approaches. Blockchain is an immutable peer-to-peer distributed database containing cryptographically secured information. Blockchain shows successful use cases in financial applications, smart contact, protecting digital copyright of media contents. It extends to all industries including the secure IoT devices, embedded systems, etc. The superior feature of blockchain is its decentralized, immutable, auditable database that secures transactions by protecting privacy. In this chapter, we contemplate the environment of the intelligent vehicle communication network and issues regarding methods of building a blockchain-based trust network among intelligent vehicles. We present the use cases of blockchain in intelligent vehicles in the phase of ongoing research or that under development from automotive industries and academic institutes. We also deliberate the challenging issue of blockchain for intelligent vehicles.

AB Recent advances in Blockchain technology has opened up a vast array of decentralized and distributed systems. The most significant contribution of this technology is it gets rid of the third-party functioning as a mediator in systems that requires trust for any kind of transaction. From this perspective, transaction of money is fundamentally an authorized third-party mediating trade of goods or services. In this chapter, we first review the conventional applications of Blockchain and next propose a novel economic system in which such value-added items are exchanged without using money and without going through a third party. In the long history of economics from ancient times, the monetized economy system today has a very short record, and it is essentially based on the existence of trustworthy central banks, governments, and organizations. However in line with the recent growing sense of decentralized systems and in keeping with unstable international affairs including the recent money crisis, it is meaningful to consider alternative economic system which can exist without going through any third party. To address this issue is one of the purposes of this chapter.

LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers, with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda, Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is its role in creating "clean data": validated, trustable, interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes, and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties), and asset tokens (Primalbase).

DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Bitcoin paved the way for a highly successful FinTech (Financial Technology) application on the basis of a newer technology termed blockchain. As this technology has evolved very recently beyond the financial market, gaining more public attention, other promising blockchain applications areas and use cases are emerging. However, it is still not a straightforward in which application areas and use cases blockchains do provide an advantage beyond distributed databases and decentralized systems. Through a decentralized and immutable data storage blockchains enable the enforcement and verification of exchange assets, while disrupting potentially existing business models by promoting the disintermediation of processes involving multiple stakeholders. While having no mediator or a third party controlling the operation, less operational costs and a higher business agility are targeted at. However, the adoption of blockchains requires not only overcoming its technical challenges, but it also implies to reach the ability to understand and handle the impact on existing business models, processes, and legal compliances. This chapter will overview the main blockchain application areas by providing examples and by discussing from the technical perspective on how and under which conditions the use of blockchains can be useful for a successful use case.

DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Security and privacy are vital to the modern blockchain technology since it can exist without an authorized third party, which means that there may not be a trusted responsible person or organization in charge of systems. In this chapter we make a survey on this issue about blockchain systems. Security of the current systems is based on the computational hardness assumptions and many of the standard cryptography systems are known to be vulnerable against the advent of full-fledged quantum computers. On the other hand, it is possible to make a blockchain more secure by virtue of quantum information technology. In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to quantum information theory and quantum computation so that readers can follow advanced researches on application of quantum technology to the blockchain industry. We also explain a novel information system which accommodates quantum states in a peer-to-peer way. It would improve the level of privacy and security by the laws of physics, which is never achievable from nonquantum information theoretic viewpoints.

AB Blockchain has promise as an approach to developing systems for a number of applications within cybersecurity. In Blockchain-based systems, data and authority can be distributed, and transparent and reliable transaction ledgers created. Some of the key advantages of Blockchain for cybersecurity applications are in conflict with privacy properties, yet many of the potential applications have complex requirements for privacy. Privacy-enabling approaches for Blockchain have been introduced, such as private Blockchains, and methods for enabling parties to act pseudonymously, but it is as yet unclear which approaches are suitable in which applications. We explore a set of proposed uses of Blockchain within cybersecurity and consider their requirements for privacy. We compare these requirements with the privacy provision of Blockchain and explore the trade-off between security and privacy, reflecting on the effect of using privacy-enabling approaches on the security advantages that Blockchain can offer.

AB Interoperability in healthcare has traditionally been focused around data exchange between business entities, for example, different hospital systems. However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing.

AB The on-demand digital healthcare ecosystem is on the near horizon. It has the potential to extract a wealth of information from "big data" collected at the population level, to enhance preventive and precision medicine at the patient level. This may improve efficiency and quality while decreasing cost of healthcare delivered by professionals. However, there are still security and privacy issues that need to be addressed before algorithms, data, and models can be mobilized safely at scale. In this paper we discuss how distributed ledger technologies can play a key role in advancing electronic health, by ensuring authenticity and integrity of data generated by wearable and embedded devices. We demonstrate how the Masked Authenticated Messaging extension module of the IOTA protocol can be used to securely share, store, and retrieve encrypted activity data using a tamper-proof distributed ledger.

AB Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the "Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap" from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decisionmaking for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology.

AB Biomedical research and clinical decision depend increasingly on scientific evidence realized by a number of authoritative databases, mostly public and continually enriched via peer scientific contributions. Given the dynamic nature of biomedical evidence data and their usage in the sensitive domain of biomedical science, it is important to ensure retrieved data integrity and non-repudiation. In this work, we present a blockchain-based notarization service that uses smart digital contracts to seal a biomedical database query and the respective results. The goal is to ensure that retrieved data cannot be modified after retrieval and that the database cannot validly deny that the particular data has been provided as a result of a specific query. Biomedical evidence data versioning is also supported. The feasibility of the proposed notarization approach is demonstrated using a real blockchain infrastructure and is tested on two different biomedical evidence databases: a publicly available medical risk factor reference repository and on the PubMed database of biomedical literature references and abstracts.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is being introduced and leveraged in many domains, but few studies have addressed MEC for secure in-home therapy management. To this end, this paper presents an in-home therapy management framework, which leverages the IoT nodes and the blockchain-based decentralized MEC paradigm to support low-latency, secure, anonymous, and always-available spatiotemporal multimedia therapeutic data communication within an on-demand data-sharing scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this non-invasive, MEC-based IoT therapy platform is first done by our group. This platform can provide a full-body joint range of motion data for physically challenged individuals in a decentralized manner. With MEC, the framework can provide therapy diagnostic and analytical data on demand to a large portion of humanity who are either born with disabilities or became disabled due to accidents, war-time injuries, or old age. For security, the framework uses blockchain-Tor-based distributed transactions to preserve the therapeutic data privacy, ownership, generation, storage, and sharing. Our initial test results from a complete implementation of the framework show that it can support a sufficiently large number of users without considerable increase in mean processing time.

AB A device-to-device (D2D) underlying cellular network is pervasive to support various wireless applications. However, due to the dramatic increase of data transmission in the network with limited amount of wireless resource, a few users may be required to temporarily disconnect from the network to avoid the interruption of data transmission in the whole network. A critical issue of determining the user access in D2D underlying networks is the authenticity of channel state information (CSI), and usually, a user with a higher CSI can be allocated a larger amount of wireless resource or have a higher probability of staying in the network. In this paper, we propose a blockchain consensus-based scheme to verify the authenticity of CSI and add the users who intentionally advocate a higher value of CSI into a fraud chain. Also, we consider both the cross-tier interference caused by a mobile user and the presence of a user in the fraud chain to determine the access of a user. The analysis results show that our proposed user access scheme can enhance the network performance by efficiently controlling the use access in mobile applications.

AB The authors review the topics discussed at the London Book Fair 2018 (April 10-12, 2018), in particular, the publishing industry, statistics, growing audiobooks sales, using big volumes of customer data for increasing profits, artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. The printed and digital books have reached some balance, while the future of e-books looks the more complicated from the perspective of copyright, self-publication, open access, piracy, data acquisition, fake news, social networks regulation and new, hidden forms of censorship. The publishing process players believe that lacking e-document rights management instruments (DRM) influences positively on the number of downloads. The authors focus on science and academic publishing issues, digital technologies in publishing. The review of these issues presented by Michael Coleman, Elsevier Publishers' Vice President, President of International Publishers Association, is discussed. Changes of national copyright legislations in several countries are analyzed. The authors emphasize that publishers are responsible for information quality and reliability. Freedom of publications is also discussed.

AB Blockchain is a brand-new technology invented to evade the global financial industry from smashing again. Unfortunately, only a small portion of people realise this new technology and the way to incorporate it into their work, leaving a significant gap in utilising the benefits of such technologies. In response to the gap, we have designed a simulation game related to Blockchain, which targets to enlighten and encourage entrepreneurs and students to utilise Blockchain. The simulation was evaluated by a group of participants using prior-questionnaire and post-questionnaire. The results indicated that the simulations could help to promote the understanding of the Blockchain concepts, and thus may facilities its broader applications in the future.

TI Blockchain Technology: Is It a Good Candidate for Securing IoT Sensitive
   Medical Data?

DT Article
AB In the past few years, the number of wireless devices connected to the Internet has increased to a number that could reach billions in the next few years. While cloud computing is being seen as the solution to process this data, security challenges could not be addressed solely with this technology. Security problems will continue to increase with such a model, especially for private and sensitive data such as personal data and medical data collected with more and more smarter connected devices constituting the so called Internet of Things. As a consequence, there is an urgent need for a fully decentralized peer-to-peer and secure technology solution to overcome these problems. The blockchain technology is a promising just-in-time solution that brings the required properties to the field. However, there are still challenges to address before using it in the context of IoT. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes a secure IoT architecture for medical data based on blockchain technology. The solution introduces a protocol for data access, smart contracts and a publisher-subscriber mechanism for notification. A simple analytical model is also presented to highlight the performance of the system. An implementation of the solution as a proof of concept is also presented.

AB There are several distributed ledger protocols potentially suitable for the Internet of things (IoT), including the Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and IOTA. This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic the smart contracts and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.

AB Optimizing physical goods distribution by providing increased visibility to trading partners can directly impact product cost. However, current supply chain information systems often lack the ability to cost-effectively relay ground truth information in near real time to all stakeholders and most importantly to the supplier and the customer during the transport of the shipment. This paper presents a solution that addresses this gap through a peer-to-peer architecture that can support the increasing demand for visibility and timely delivery of information during the physical distribution phase of supply chain. Additional features of the proposed solution include scalability, privacy and validity of the information that is delivered to the trading partners. The solution enables small, medium and large businesses to interact in a dynamic and shipment-centric manner through a private blockchain sub-ledger that digitizes the transfer of custody chain for each shipment. Information in this private ledger is augmented by a public event ledger that reflects the movement of the shipment in near real time. Third party monitors are engaged in the validation of the geolocation of the shipments by posting their physical proximity in the form of events to the public ledger.

AB Autonomous connected vehicles are a main concept in the future of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) since they provide an increase in safety and road efficiency. The management and coordination of the connected vehicles is based on periodic communications among the vehicles involved in the network, and with their surrounding environment. However, a major concern regarding this information sharing process is how to provide a secure transmission while fulfilling the latency requirements. Here we propose the use of a joint paradigm to securely manage the inter-vehicular communications. First, a ring-signature based scheme is applied to verify the identity of the vehicles joining the network. Second, the information is shared among the vehicles and consensually verified using a blockchain-based mechanism using secure communication channels created by multi-party smart contracts. The proposed protocol fulfills the stringent requirements in latency for vehicular networks by means of almost instantaneous communications while providing an anonymous secure system for the members of the network relying on cryptographic primitives.

AB Bitcoin has shown great utility around the world with the drastic increase in its value and global consensus method of proof-of-work (POW). Over the years after the revolution in the digital transaction space, we are looking at major scalability issue with old POW consensus method and bitcoin peak limit of processing only 7 transactions per second. With more companies trying to adopt blockchain to modify their existing systems, blockchain working on old consensus methods and with scalability issues can't deliver the optimal solution. Specifically, with new trends like smart contracts and DAPPs, much better performance is needed to support any actual business applications. Such requirements are pushing the new platforms away from old methods of consensus and adoption of off-chain solutions. In this paper, we discuss various scalability issues with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and recent proposals like the lighting protocol, sharding, super quadratic sharding, DPoS to solve these issues. We also draw the comparison between these proposals on their ability to overcome scalability limits and highlighting major problems in these approaches. In the end, we propose our solution to suffice the scalability issue and conclude with the fact that with better scalability, blockchain has the potential to outrageously support varied domains of the industry.

AB While blockchain services hold great promise to improve many different industries, there are significant cybersecurity concerns which must be addressed. In this paper, we present experimental test bed results for a novel method of user identity management for cloud-based blockchain applications. Using a BlackRidge Technology endpoint on a Windows host, we insert cryptographic identity tokens on the first packet to request a new session. A corresponding gateway appliance in the cloud enforces security policy, blocking unauthorized access at or below the transport layer. Results of penetration testing a sample Hyperledger 1.0 application are discussed. We also demonstrate network segmentation and traffic separation, which allows multiple organizations to share blockchain infrastructure and facilitates compliance auditing.

AB The conventional electric power system is a unidirectional configuration that delivers electricity to the consumer in the power plant, but as the prosumers emerges, microgrid technology that enables bi-directional configuration has been developed. By applying the data distribution processing technology called the blockchain to the microgrid, time and cost can be saved compared with the conventional microgrid system. Through the related research, we analyze the structure of the microgrid and the utilization of the blockchain, study the pros and cons of applying the public blockchain and the private (consortium) blockchain, and propose the possible scenarios.

AB Blockchain, as secure means for asset transfer, greatly attracts the attention of the global economic community. However, scalability strongly hampers the growth of economic systems based on the blockchain technology. Bi-directional micropayment channels are suitable solutions for scalability on economic systems based on blockchain. However, the challenge presented by micropayment channels is the inefficient routing mechanisms and timelocks generated per channel for a given path chosen to execute a transaction. In this paper, we develop suitable routing algorithms for economic systems based on blockchain. We additionally derive suitable equations to generate unique timelocks for channels belonging to selected paths chosen to execute a transaction. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the protocol based on number of connections and bandwidth with evidence showing the efficiency and scalability of the routing mechanism.

AB In this paper, we design, develop, and evaluate a novel information sharing (iShare) framework for cybersecurity with the goal of protecting confidential information and networked infrastructures from future cyber-attacks. The proposed iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution, cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control over any other organizations' data or damage caused by cyber-attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger that has just hashed pointers. Moreover, we analyze the security attacks by outsiders (not participating in the iShare) using a Stackelberg game.

AB Nowadays, innovative development becomes a crucial component of socioeconomic transformation. However, the Russian lending structure contradicts the interests of innovative development, although it reflects the needs of major segments of the national economy. The main objective of this research is to determine the possible options of banking sector modernization offered by modern technologies allowing to solve the accumulated contradictions between reproductive investment needs and lending practices. Analytical and theoretical results of our study have shown that the banking system does not meet the requirements of expanded reproduction and needs a significant change. The obtained results can be used to develop new technological bases of investment banking in the context of modern social and economic transformation.

AB Automated sales systems, a recent technology, offer a wide range of products and services. This technology has advanced by combining with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, because of the development of such technology, data storage and management systems with trusted third parties cannot efficiently defend against data forgery attacks. In this study, a blockchain network is applied to an automated sales system. A smart automated sales machine using smart contracts is proposed. This system enables users to know the quantity of products or status of service provision before they visit an automated sales system. In addition, the system administrator can immediately see the expense-reduction effect of system management and address any problems in the system.

DE Smart Greenhouse; Internet of Things; Blockchain
AB The emerging greenhouse technology in agriculture based on Internet of Things (IoT) used for remote monitoring and automation has been rapidly developed. But it still has major concern about security and privacy, due to the large scale of disseminating nature of its network. To overcome these security challenges, we use blockchain which allows the creation of a distributed digital ledger of transactions that is shared among the nodes on IoT network. The main aim of this paper is to provide lightweight blockchain based architecture for smart greenhouse farms to provide security and privacy. Here, IoT devices in greenhouses which act as a blockchain managed centrally to optimize energy consumption have the benefit of private immutable ledgers. In addition, we present a security framework that blends the blockchain technology with IoT devices to provide a secure communication platform in Smart Greenhouse farming.

AB Blockchain technologies are central to what has been described as a new smart social contract'. With blockchain, individual cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a whole suite of restructured social, political and financial transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a feminist weapon'. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the metallism' surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the new libertarianism' whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate meat traceability by outlining the different perspectives and opinions of meat supply chain stakeholders (SCSs); it also evaluates potential of acceptance of blockchain technology (BCT) as a viable transparency and traceability system (TTS).
   Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of 141 consumers reveals their opinions about TTSs. In addition, semi-structured interviews with seven retail managers, four government officials and one blockchain service provider (Project Provenance Ltd) provide expert insights.
   Findings The results demonstrate that consumers are overwhelmed by the amount and complexity of certification labels. As a TTS, BCT implementation appears to have significant positive influences on consumers' purchasing decisions, mediated by consumers' quality perceptions. This study reveals the discordant perspectives of different stakeholders with regard to the importance of a BCT-based TTS.
   Originality/value This study investigates current TTSs and certification labels, and probes customer perception of a potential BCT-based solution for meat traceability. Changes to supply chains' mentality and the active establishment of trust in BCT applications are needed. Firms should take both holistic and altruistic views to deal with the challenges of TTSs in the meat supply chain. The adoption of BCT, in combination with DNA coding, seems promising as a solution to many of the issues that currently plague TTSs.

AB The Blockchain (BC) technology has received religious attention in the financial and internet domains, and recently interest has spread to adjacent sectors like communications. This paper seeks to identify the impact of the BC technology in novel spectrum sharing concepts using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) concept as an example. The results indicate that the BC core characteristics can be utilized in several use cases addressing current CBRS implementation considerations. The CBRS concept could particularly benefit of BCs in building trust, consensus and lowering the transaction cost. In BC deployments, confidentiality should be taken into consideration through hybrid and private BC options. Furthermore, the cognitive radio spectrum sharing - BC combination paves the way for new business models and distributed services.

AB Trustworthy generation of public random numbers is necessary for the security of a number of cryptographic applications. It was suggested to use the inherent unpredictability of blockchains as a source of public randomness. Entropy from the Bitcoin blockchain in particular has been used in lotteries and has been suggested for a number of other applications ranging from smart contracts to election auditing. In this Arcticle, we analyse this idea and show how an adversary could manipulate these random numbers, even with limited computational power and financial budget.

AB Innovation technologies have substantially changed commerce and society. A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers' rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks.

DE Task allocation; Multi-robot systems; Multi-agent systems; Blockchain
AB One of the challenges in developing multi-robot systems is the design of appropriate coordination strategies in such a way that robots perform their operations efficiently. In particular, efficient coordination requires judicious task allocation. Without appropriate task allocation, the use of multi-robot systems in complex scenarios becomes limited or even unfeasible. Real-world scenarios usually require the use of heterogeneous robots and task fulfillment with different structures, constraints, and degrees of complexity. In such scenarios, decentralised solutions seem to be appropriate for task allocation, since centralised solutions represent a single point of failure for the system. During the allocation process, in decentralised approaches, there are often communication requirements, as participants need to share information. Maintaining data integrity, resilience, and security in data access are some of the important features for this type of solution. In that direction, we propose an architecture for dynamic and decentralised allocation of tasks built on the idea of having communication and coordination in a multi-agent system through a private blockchain.

TI Trust in a viable real estate economy with disruption and blockchain

DT Article
DE Values; Strategic management; Real estate; Artificial intelligence;
   Property portfolio management; Value management
AB Purpose - The real estate world finds itself at a tipping point of a transition: a dramatic and irreversible shift in (real estate) systems in society. This paper is a State of the art of Disruption, Blockchain and Real Estate in the Netherlands and international.
   Design/methodology/approach - The following questions were asked to all those involved: What do you think is the essence of Blockchain for real estate? What is the most current situation with respect to Blockchain and real estate from your perspective? Which publications are important from your perspective? What do you expect with respect to the impact of Blockchain on real estate for (social) real estate? What are questions for the future for real estate and Blockchain? In addition, interviews, exploratory conversations and correspondence took place, and the content was peer reviewed.
   Findings - Changes in value concepts affect the valuation of real estate and the thinking about it. The orientation of changing users and owners of real estate affects innovativeness, values and flexibility in managing that property. Orientation on disruption must be seen as proof that the real estate world is able to actually innovate the accumulated assets and consolidate this. The financial and real estate markets are markets that exaggerate through irrational behaviour. Fear of "eat or be eaten" determines people's behaviour. Financial and thus real estate markets are always unstable and must always be regulated by people and organizations.
   Research limitations/implications - The question that remains is whether it is important to look at disruptive innovations in existing markets or newcomers in the real estate market and Blockchain. The question is whether Blockchain is only a technological disruption, or a real game changer, and whether the entire value chain of the real estate market will embrace it. No two disruptions are the same. Trust in Blockchain is a prerequisite for guiding the predictable form of that disruption where start-up companies use new technology to offer cheaper and inferior alternatives to real estate in the market. You could also talk about anti-fragile value: "Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile" (Taleb, 2012), in other words: attention to disruption and Blockchain creates a viable real estate economy.
   Practical implications - The true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate still needs to be investigated. The author is still curious to understand and clarify the value of Blockchain for real estate processes. Doubt continues to exist and is therefore a feeding ground for further research, because we do not know what we have not seen.
   Social implications - Looking at the impact of Blockchain on real estate, a number of conclusions can be drawn. First of all, the relationship between Blockchain and real estate has not yet been proven in practice. It is expected to develop further in the form of registering transaction processes and the DNA passport of a real estate object. Secondly, completeness and transparency are the basic ingredients for trust in the system. Third, real estate wants to remain viable. For this reason, taking the offense is necessary for real estate and management to connect with social demand. Behaviour also leads to new earnings models of the social and economic spin-off of disruptive real estate. If the Dutch real estate sector embraces Blockchain and is able to realize innovations, there are opportunities for real estate entrepreneurs to exploit the disruptive character to provide those new services.
   Originality/value - The way in which disruption, Blockchain and real estate will develop in the coming years are not the only obvious characteristics of a particular era but also its social impact and user behaviour. This also applies to how this real estate transition can best be tracked, guided and utilized in society at the international, national and regional level. Disruptive organizations clearly respond to the viability of the (built) environment and therefore determine competitive strength. This affects the current and future valuation of real estate.

AB All record-keeping systems (which include monetary systems) must contend with trust issues and methods of organizing historical information. Conventional systems rely on the reputation of central authorities and record-keepers to achieve consensus. Blockchain, which powers Bitcoin, differs from conventional systems by achieving consensus through a community of anonymous (and therefore "trustless") agents who compete amongst themselves to authenticate transactions. The promise of the blockchain protocol is that it is invulnerable to human foibles. Novel, for sure; but is it worth all the effort?

TI Is Bitcoin a Waste of Resources?
SO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Do Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies play a useful social role, or do they represent a social waste? Bitcoin is a decentralized recordkeeping system, with updating of the record of transactions in the blockchain. Potentially, Bitcoin could be useful if it is widely used as a means of payment or as a safe-haven asset. But, given its properties, it is an inefficient and poorly designed means of payment and probably cannot survive as a safe haven asset. Bitcoin could encourage crime, which is a further social cost, but fortunately it may not serve criminals well either.

AB The need to obtain prompt access to funds through electronic communications, protecting investment after the global financial crisis has led to the emergence of a new type of electronic money - the cryptocurrencies. The modern state and prospects for development of the cryptocurrency as a special kind of electronic money were expounded. Cryptocurrencies gain significant popularity due to the advantages of their use, such as: comfort, independence, accessibility, lack of engagement, confidentiality, no documents, full automation of accounting, and cost optimization for administration. Various scientific positions concerning the accounting and economic positioning of the cryptocurrencies in Ukraine were researched. The proposed order to display in accounting the processes of initial obtaining (mining) with the definition of a cost calculating method and operation of the cryptocurrencies most fully corresponds to the national accounting treatment. It was proposed to resolve to the problems of management accounting of electronic money and cryptocurrencies in Ukraine through the combination of functional capabilities of the blockchain technology, positive qualities of the "Internet Bank" and "Client-Bank" communications, which will enable to create a hybrid system of non-cash payments by the cryptocurrencies, electronic money, funds on accounts in a bank with free conversion of existing funds and possibilities for information exchange with all the participants in settlement operations. The article presents a methodology for collecting accounting information on settlements with the cryptocurrencies and other electronic money without the formation of traditional payment documents and bank statements. Electronic information from the hybrid communication system is the foundation for fully automated documenting, formation of accounting records, informing accountants and management of non-cash transfers. Automation of management accounting of electronic transactions helps to increase the level of internal and external control over execution of money operations due to timely and remote informing sharing about the parameters of payments.

AB Based on our analysis of trends and threats associated with the use of financial technology, we conclude that its implementation increases the complexity of the institutional structure of the financial system. Certain institutional factors earlier regarded by scholars as anomalies that had either none or an insignificant effect on the development of the financial system are now emerging. These factors are becoming increasingly fundamental, and are in fact transforming the financial system. As the result, the established functional relations fail, while new institutions and new interdependences emerge, which leads to certain unforeseen destabilizing consequences.
   The spontaneity of the process of systemic transformation determines human behavior, that is why it is not always possible to clearly anticipate the outcomes of such transformation.
   Financial innovations are more difficult to regulate because there are no formal rules established for most of them, and they themselves are so novel that they fall outside the control of regulatory authorities. We believe that in order to prevent potentially adverse effects, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between government agencies and financial technology companies for the purpose of developing formal rules and procedures for ensuring the reliability and the security of the financial sector. It is important to work towards increasing the degree of trust and to establish a culture of innovation which would help the participants of financial markets adapt to the rapidly changing financial environment.

AB The recent expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the consequent explosion in the volume of data produced by smart devices have led to the outsourcing of data to designated data centers. However, to manage these huge data stores, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage cannot afford auspicious way. There are many challenges that must be addressed in the traditional network architecture due to the rapid growth in the diversity and number of devices connected to the internet, which is not designed to provide high availability, real-time data delivery, scalability, security, resilience, and low latency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture with a software defined networking (SDN) enable controller fog nodes at the edge of the network to meet the required design principles. The proposed model is a distributed cloud architecture based on blockchain technology, which provides low-cost, secure, and on-demand access to the most competitive computing infrastructures in an IoT network. By creating a distributed cloud infrastructure, the proposed model enables cost-effective high-performance computing. Furthermore, to bring computing resources to the edge of the IoT network and allow low latency access to large amounts of data in a secure manner, we provide a secure distributed fog node architecture that uses SDN and blockchain techniques. Fog nodes are distributed fog computing entities that allow the deployment of fog services, and are formed by multiple computing resources at the edge of the IoT network. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with the existing models using various performance measures. The results of our evaluation show that performance is improved by reducing the induced delay, reducing the response time, increasing throughput, and the ability to detect real-time attacks in the IoT network with low performance overheads.

   edge-centric Internet of Things
AB With the exponential rise in the number of devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is geared toward edge-centric computing to offer high bandwidth, low latency, and improved connectivity. In contrast, legacy cloud-centric platforms offer deteriorated bandwidth and connectivity that affect the quality of service. Edge-centric Internet of Things-based technologies, such as fog and mist computing, offer distributed and decentralized solutions to resolve the drawbacks of cloud-centric models. However, to foster distributed edge-centric models, a decentralized consensus system is necessary to incentivize all participants to share their edge resources. This paper is motivated by the shortage of comprehensive reviews on decentralized consensus systems for edge-centric Internet of Things that elucidates myriad of consensus facets, such as data structure, scalable consensus ledgers, and transaction models. Decentralized consensus systems adopt either blockchain or blockchainless directed acyclic graph technologies, which serve as immutable public ledgers for transactions. This paper scrutinizes the pros and cons of state-of-the-art decentralized consensus systems. With an extensive literature review and categorization based on existing decentralized consensus systems, we propose a thematic taxonomy. The pivotal features and characteristics associated with existing decentralized consensus systems are analyzed via a comprehensive qualitative investigation. The commonalities and variances among these systems are analyzed using key criteria derived from the presented literature. Finally, several open research issues on decentralized consensus for edge-centric IoT are presented, which should be highlighted regarding centralization risk and deficiencies in blockchain/blockchainless solutions.

AB Bitcoin has recently attracted considerable attention in the fields of economics, cryptography, and computer science due to its inherent nature of combining encryption technology and monetary units. This paper reveals the effect of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) by analyzing the time series of Bitcoin process. We also select the most relevant features from Blockchain information that is deeply involved in Bitcoin's supply and demand and use them to train models to improve the predictive performance of the latest Bitcoin pricing process. We conduct the empirical study that compares the Bayesian neural network with other linear and non-linear benchmark models on modeling and predicting the Bitcoin process. Our empirical studies show that BNN performs well in predicting Bitcoin price time series and explaining the high volatility of the recent Bitcoin price.

ID BITCOIN
AB With the purpose of identifying cyber threats and possible incidents, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely deployed in various computer networks. In order to enhance the detection capability of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection networks (or collaborative IDSs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to exchange data with each other. However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains. In particular, we introduce the background of intrusion detection and blockchain, discuss the applicability of blockchain to intrusion detection, and identify open challenges in this direction.

AB The Internet of Energy (IoE) provides an effective networking technology for distributed green energy, which allows the connection of energy anywhere at any time. As an important part of the IoE, electric vehicles (EVs), and charging pile management are of great significance to the development of the IoE industry. Previous work has mainly focused on network performance optimization for its management, and few studies have considered the security of the management between EVs and charging piles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized security model based on the lightning network and smart contract in the blockchain ecosystem; this proposed model is called the lightning network and smart contract (LNSC). The overall model involves registration, scheduling, authentication, and charging phases. The new proposed security model can be easily integrated with current scheduling mechanisms to enhance the security of trading between EVs and charging piles. Experimental results according to a realistic infrastructure are presented in this paper. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance vehicle security. Different performances of LNSC-based scheduling strategies are also presented.

AB Identity-based cryptosystems mean that public keys can be directly derived from user identifiers, such as telephone numbers, email addresses, and social insurance number, and so on. So they can simplify key management procedures of certificate-based public key infrastructures and can be used to realize authentication in blockchain. Linearly homomorphic signature schemes allow to perform linear computations on authenticated data. And the correctness of the computation can be publicly verified. Although a series of homomorphic signature schemes have been designed recently, there are few homomorphic signature schemes designed in identity-based cryptography. In this paper, we construct a new ID-based linear homomorphic signature scheme, which avoids the shortcomings of the use of public-key certificates. The scheme is proved secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message and ID attack under the random oracle model. The ID-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes can be applied in e-business and cloud computing. Finally, we show how to apply it to realize authentication in blockchain.

AB Nowadays, blockchain has become one of the most cutting-edge technologies, which has been widely concerned and researched. However, the quantum computing attack seriously threatens the security of blockchain, and related research is still less. Targeting at this issue, in this paper, we present the definition of post-quantum blockchain (PQB) and propose a secure cryptocurrency scheme based on PQB, which can resist quantum computing attacks. First, we propose a signature scheme based on lattice problem. We use lattice basis delegation algorithm to generate secret keys with selecting a random value, and sign message by preimage sampling algorithm. In addition, we design the first-signature and last-signature in our scheme, which are defined as double-signature. It is used to reduce the correlation between the message and the signature. Second, by combining the proposed signature scheme with blockchain, we construct the PQB and propose this cryptocurrency scheme. Its security can be reduced to the lattice short integer solution (SIS) problem. At last, through our analysis, the proposed cryptocurrency scheme is able to resist the quantum computing attack and its signature satisfies correctness and one-more unforgeability under the lattice SIS assumption. Furthermore, compared with previous signature schemes, the sizes of signature and secret keys are relatively shorter than that of others, which can decrease the computational complexity. These make our cryptocurrency scheme more secure and efficient.

AB At present, several post-quantum cryptosystems have been proposed, and lattice-based cryptography is the main candidate. Especially in the direction of digital signatures, there are now many practical lattice-based signature schemes. However, there exist few lattice-based signatures with special property such as blind signature. Blind signature was introduced by Chaum for creating untraceable payment system. Then, it is widely used in e-cash and voting, especially in the revolutionary digital cash system based on blockchain. In our paper, we present a method to construct a post-quantum blind signature based on lattice assumptions, and we proved that any existential forger against the security of the resulting scheme can solve the SISq,n,m,beta problem for beta = (O) over tilde (d ). Our main technique is the rejection sampling theory. The expected number of times needed to output a blind signature is at most e(2) under aborting, and our new scheme has much smaller signature size than those of all the previously proposed blind signature schemes over lattices.

AB In distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, peers self-organize and cooperate to effectively complete certain tasks such as forwarding files, delivering messages, or uploading data. Nevertheless, users are selfish in nature and they may refuse to cooperate due to their concerns on energy and bandwidth consumption. Thus each user should receive a satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption for cooperation. However, suitable incentive mechanisms that can meet the diverse requirements of users in dynamic and distributed P2P environments are still missing. On the other hand, we observe that Blockchain is a decentralized secure digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions and Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies get more and more market capitalization. Therefore in this paper, we propose a Blockchain based truthful incentive mechanism for distributed P2P applications that applies a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to incentivize users for cooperation. In this mechanism, users who help with a successful delivery get rewarded. As users and miners in the Blockchain P2P system may exhibit selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a secure validation method and a pricing strategy, and integrate them into our incentive mechanism. Through a game theoretical analysis and evaluation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security strength of our proposed incentive mechanism.

AB Blockchain can potentially be deployed in a wide range of applications due to its capability to ensure decentralization, transparency, and immutability. In this paper, we design a cryptographic membership authentication scheme (i.e., authenticating graph data) to support blockchain-based identity management systems (BIMS). Such a system is designed to bind a digital identity object to its real-world entity. Specifically, we introduce a new transitively closed undirected graph authentication (TCUGA) scheme, which only needs to use node signatures (e.g., certificates for identifying nodes). The trapdoor hash function used in our scheme allows the signer to efficiently update the certificates without the need to re-sign the nodes. In other words, our scheme is efficient even though the graph dynamically adds or deletes vertices and edges. Moreover, our proposal can efficiently provide a proof when the edge between two vertices does not exist, thus solving the existing intractability issue in transitive signature (the main tool for authenticating graph data). Finally, we prove the security of our proposed TCUGA in the standard model and evaluate its performance to show its feasibility for BIMS.

AB The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.

All key stakeholders in the value-chain are infected: advertisers with fraud, publishers with their diminishing share of advertising budgets, and users with their right to privacy. Blockchain presents a possible solution to addressing the critical issues in the online advertising supply chain. The question remains whether blockchain scalability, energy-efficiency, and token volatility issues can be solved in the coming years to the extent that online advertising could widely leverage trustlessness and the benefits gained from blockchain technology. This paper aims to review the current progress and to open a discussion to address the issues. We present new requirements for blockchain-based online advertising solutions. We have also analyzed the available solutions against the requirements and recommend directions for future research and solution development. Evidence from our research points out that blockchain is not yet ready to be widely implemented in online advertising. More research is needed, and new proof-of-concepts need to be developed before blockchain technology can be considered a trusted alternative for the current online advertising marketplace based on open real-time bidding.

TI A Security Authentication Scheme of 5G Ultra-Dense Network Based on

AB The ultra-dense network (UDN) is one of the most promising technologies in the fifth generation (5G) to address the network system capacity issue. However, it is a new challenge that the user equipment (UE) secure access UDN composed of the access points (APs) which characterized with autonomy, temporary, and dynamic. In 5G UDN, the APs are independent and equal. The UDN can be regarded as a decentralized access network. Compared with the traditional base station, the AP has a smaller coverage. There has an issue that the interaction between the UE and APs will be more frequent when UE moves. However, the existing 4G authentication and key agreement algorithm cannot adapt to this fast and frequent authentication requirement. If the UE moves smoothly in a trusted APs group (APG) without frequent authentication, this problem will be solved very well. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a security authentication scheme of 5G UDN based on the block chaining technologies. In this paper, an APG-PBFT algorithm based on the block chaining technology with Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, the consensus mechanism will be optimized and a new reverse screening method will be embedded. In our solution, a trusted chain APG can be generated with APs by APG-PBFT algorithm, and the authentication results can be shared in the APG using the blockchain message propagation mechanism. The principle of fast authentication with APG-PBFT algorithm is present in this paper. The scheme can reduce the authentication frequency when UE moves among the APs and improve the access efficiency. Finally, we analyze the performance of APG-PBFT algorithm and compare it with the traditional PBFT algorithm. The simulation results show that the APG-PBFT algorithm can improve the APG generation efficiency and reduce the authentication frequency of UE, which will be valuably applied to the UDN environment.

TI Proof of Delivery of Digital Assets Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts

AB There is an immense need of a proof of delivery (PoD) of today's digital media and content, especially those that are subject to payment. Current PoD systems are mostly centralized and heavily dependent on a trusted third party (TTP) especially for payment. Such existing PoD systems often lack security, transparency, and visibility, and are not highly credible, as the TTP can be subject to failure, manipulation, corruption, compromise, and hacking. In this paper, we propose a decentralized PoD solution for PoD of digital assets. Our solution leverages key features of blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts to provide immutable and tamper-proof logs, accountability, and traceability. Ethereum smart contracts are used to orchestrate and govern all interactions and transactions including automatic payments in Ether cryptocurrency between customers, digital-content provider, and the file server hosting the digital content. All entities are incentivized to act honestly, and our solution has a mechanism to handle dispute if arisen among participants. The solution has an off-chain secure download phase involving the file server and customers. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of interplanetary file system to store the agreed upon terms and conditions between the smart contract actors. A security analysis of our proposed system has been provided. The full code of the smart contract has been publicly made available on Github.

AB The smart terminal and grid protection devices play a very important role in the safe operation of the smart grid. Traditional maintenance and renewal of the center node wastes a lot of manpower and material resources and have huge safety implications. This paper proposes a safety equipment diagnosis mechanism based on consortium blockchain technology to realize more efficient, convenient, and secure device maintenance. When a device has problems or notices improper operation, it can make a device diagnosis request in the consortium blockchain network, and receive a diagnosis response from a vendor or non-original supplier nodes. This scheme designs a decentralized safety equipment diagnosis smart contract, combining response node bid price and credit, and applies a multi-dimensional reverse auction mechanism to determine bid node and transaction price. After a smart device diagnosed, the relevant message will be packaged and sent to a smartphone, which can use the client to set up the smart contract of equipment operation policy. Paillier encryption arithmetic can be used to ensure device diagnosis mechanism safety. The proposed scheme is guaranteed not to reveal sensitive information in the process of device interaction.

AB Blockchain technology rapidly gained popularity based on its open and decentralized operation. Consensus protocol is the core mechanism of a blockchain network that securely maintains the distributed ledger from possible attacks from adversaries. Proof-of-work (PoW) is a commonly used consensus protocol that requires a significant amount of computation to find a new valid block. As the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are specially designed for PoW computation begin to dominate blockchain consensus operation, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks is being threatened. Many PoW mechanisms are being proposed to disincentivize the use of ASICs in the consensus operation. Employing multiple hash functions in the PoW computation (i.e., multi-hash PoW) is one of the commonly adopted approaches to achieve such ASIC-resistance. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the level of ASIC-resistance of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms. We assess the level of ASIC-resistance based on the performance gap between ASICs and general-purpose computing platforms. Contrary to the expectation of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms, our results reveal that ASIC-resistance of these PoW mechanisms is not strong enough to prevent ASIC-based mining. Most of them show similar levels of ASIC-resistance as those of PoW mechanisms that are already defeated by ASIC-based systems.

AB The concept of Bitcoin was first introduced by an unknown individual (or a group of people) named Satoshi Nakamoto before it was released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol. Last, we discuss current existing security studies and solutions and summarize open research challenges and trends for future research in Bitcoin security.

AB The vehicle to everything (V2X) requires the real-time integration of all kinds of information on roads, pedestrians, the environment, and vehicles themselves. This information also needs to be shared with other vehicles. The effective integration of information and the strong privacy protection are the key restrictions on the development of the V2X. The previous privacy protection model has mainly focused on the centralized network, and there were problems with the centralized gateway and single-point decision, which were not suitable for the decentralized scenario. Therefore, this paper proposes a remote attestation security model based on a privacy-preserving blockchain. The overall model involves two core steps. First, the vehicle provides the network with an evidence of a credible identity and integrity. Secured, the vehicles in the network calculate the nodes to make their respective decisions, and the accounting nodes summarize the sub-conclusions, form the final results, and write them into data blocks. The analysis shows that it possesses the security features of decentralization, traceability, anonymity, irreplaceability, and high efficiency. The model framework, core block chain structure, and protocol process are described in detail. The experimental results based on a realistic infrastructure are presented. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance the security of the communications of intelligent vehicles in the V2X.

TI Optimization of Executable Formal Interpreters Developed in Higher-Order

AB In recent publications, we presented a novel formal symbolic process virtual machine (FSPVM) framework that combined higher-order logic theorem proving and symbolic execution for verifying the reliability and security of smart contracts developed in the Ethereum blockchain system without suffering from standard issues surrounding reusability, consistency, and automation. A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. This paper addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly.

TI Learning to Classify Blockchain Peers According to Their Behavior

SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English

DE Classification algorithms; computer applications; time series analysis
AB Blockchain technologies have the potential to establish novel financial service infrastructures and reshape numerous fields. A blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger maintained by a set of peers (i.e., trading nodes) that do not fully trust each other. A key challenge that blockchain faces is to precisely classify the blockchain peers into categories with respect to their behavior patterns, which will not only enable deeper insights into the blockchain network but also facilitate more effective maintenance of the various peers (in private chains). In this paper, we introduce and formulate the problem of behavior pattern classification in blockchain networks and propose a novel deep-learning-based method, termed PeerClassifier , to address the problem. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally define the problem of peer behavior classification in blockchain networks. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that PeerClassifier is significantly more effective than the existing conventional methods.

AB The public key infrastructure-based authentication protocol provides basic security services for the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, trust and privacy are still open issues due to the unique characteristics of VANETs. It is crucial to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting forged messages while simultaneously preserving the privacy of vehicles against the tracking attacks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to establish a privacy-preserving trust model for VANETs. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently with the proofs of presence and absence based on the extended blockchain technology. The public keys are used as pseudonyms in communications without any information about real identities for conditional anonymity. In order to prevent the distribution of forged messages, a reputation evaluation algorithm is presented relying on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about vehicles. A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security, validity, and performance, and the results show that BARS is able to establish a trust model with transparency, conditional anonymity, efficiency, and robustness for VANETs.

AB One particular trend observed in healthcare is the progressive shift of data and services to the cloud, partly due to convenience (e.g. availability of complete patient medical history in real-time) and savings (e.g. economics of healthcare data management). There are, however, limitations to using conventional cryptographic primitives and access control models to address security and privacy concerns in an increasingly cloud-based environment. In this paper, we study the potential to use the Blockchain technology to protect healthcare data hosted within the cloud. We also describe the practical challenges of such a proposition and further research that is required.

AB The success of almost any business depends on the promotion of digital excellence. Disruptive technologies like Hadoop, IoT, Blockchain or DevOps pose completely new challenges for business development. While there is no doubt about the need for keeping pace with the technical progress it is blurry how much this affects leadership and organizational agility. At least in Germany, many analysts record a gap between the engineering innovativeness and an inadequate digital leadership. It is evident, that digitization leads to new occupational profiles and a specific stress on the organizational fabric. Many companies experiment with start-up culture, entrepreneurial responsibility and more flexible team patterns, but a consistent approach for manager is still missing. In this preliminary discussion we address three dimensions to increase a company's agility in times of digital Darwinism: structural flexibility, software-driven occupational profiles and requirements for leadership.

AB The article describes the advantages provided by the implementation of a directed acyclic graph in the blockchain network. The advantages and known limitations of common blockchain networks are described. It is shown how directed acyclic graph allows increasing the speed of transactions between the network nodes and scaling the channel width due to the formation of parallel chains instead of the single true chain in common blockchain networks. Consequently, it is shown how blockchain network with directed acyclic graph also eliminates the concept of mining, allowing for transactions without the corresponding fees.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a cross-enterprises framework to achieve a higher level of sharing of knowledge and services in manufacturing ecosystems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors describe the development of the emerging open manufacturing and discuss the model of knowledge creation processes of manufacturers. The authors present a decentralized framework based on blockchain and edge computing technologies, which consists of a customer layer, an enterprise layer, an application layer, an intelligence layer, a data layer, and an infrastructure layer. And a case study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework.
   Findings - The authors discuss that the manufacturing ecosystem is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed systems. The proposed framework incorporates the recent development in blockchain and edge computing that can meet the secure and distributed requirements for the sharing of knowledge and services in manufacturing ecosystems.
   Practical implications - The proposed framework provides a more secure and controlled way to share knowledge and services, thereby supports the company to develop scalable and flexible business at a lower cost, and ultimately improves the overall quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of manufacturing services.
   Originality/value - The proposed framework incorporates the recent development in edge computing technologies to achieve a flexible and distributed network. With the blockchain technology, it provides standards and protocols for implementing the framework and ensures the security issues. Not only information can be shared, but the framework also supports in the exchange of knowledge and services so that the parties can contribute their parts.

AB Over the last few years, research on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has snowballed across many disciplines: technical fields, economics, law, public policy, finance, accounting, and others. As the uses of blockchain technology behind Bitcoin expand, more disciplines will be drawn to its study and the research will greatly expand. This paper provides an assessment of the current state of the literature. From a comprehensive search of the literature that resulted in an original sample of 13,507 results, a final sample of 1,206 papers on Bitcoin are categorised and mapped across six disciplines.

ID TRACEABILITY
AB An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of determining provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods (e.g., tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods) has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, interorganizational, often internationally spanning supply chains. Recent adoptions of the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies give promise at better supply-chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain, as many favored use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies, as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.

AB The initiative (since 2014) project described in this paper is a product of a joint innovative research and implementation effort of the Civil Engineering and Architecture Institute, Ural Federal University, the Science and Engineering Centre "Reliability and Safety of Large Systems and Machines", Ural Branch Russian Academy of Sciences (both Yekaterinburg), Start-up OptiCits, Barcelona, Spain and the Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA. The project is based on using the MAICS convergent technology [1] to create a versatile multi-purpose tool for optimizing the science and art of risk based governance of resilience-smart and sustainable city infrastructure and communities operating in usual and extreme conditions. The tool being developed is tailored to the needs of the City of Yekaterinburg-the capital of the Urals Region and allegedly the third most important and vibrant city of Russia. It is also being offered to the Yekaterinburg City Administration as an every-day decision-support work-tool and addendum to the Strategic Program "Yekaterinburg 2030 - a Safe City"[2] during preparation of the city for winning and conducting the World Expo-2025. Authors believe that the findings of this research would also be useful to the Sverdlovsk Oblast cities of every size and type of communities that inhabit them, including, first and foremost, Nizhny Tagil, Kamensk Uralsky, Serov, Pervouralsk, Revda, Verkhnyaya Pyshma, multiple mono-cities et al. The project also incorporates block-chain technology, smart contracts and digital currency as an effective tool for implementing the project.

AB Electronic voting or e-voting has been used in varying forms since 1970s with fundamental benefits over paper-based systems such as increased efficiency and reduced errors. However, challenges remain to the achieving of wide spread adoption of such systems, especially with respect to improving their resilience against potential faults. Blockchain is a disruptive technology of the current era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems. This article presents an effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability.

AB Rapid advances in industrialisation and informatisation methods have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of manufacturing technology. Today, we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In 2013, amongst one of 10 Future Projects' identified by the German government as part of its High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, the Industry 4.0 project is considered to be a major endeavour for Germany to establish itself as a leader of integrated industry. In 2014, China's State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world's workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China's industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges. In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in the area of Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.

AB Blockchain has numerous benefits such as decentralisation, persistency, anonymity and auditability. There is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, risk management, internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology in both technological and application perspectives. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology. In particular, this paper gives the blockchain taxonomy, introduces typical blockchain consensus algorithms, reviews blockchain applications and discusses technical challenges as well as recent advances in tackling the challenges. Moreover, this paper also points out the future directions in the blockchain technology.

AB Nowadays, almost none of the fields of human activity can do without supply chain management. In addition, implementation of one in construction companies contributes to major economic benefits. The article considers the application feasibility of blockchain in logistics of construction materials through the usage of RFID technology. An example of introduction to the process of manufacturing and delivery of ready-mixed concrete is given. The main advantages, shortcomings, perspectives, as well as difficulties arising in the implementation of blockchain technology in the construction industry are described. Special attention is paid to the applicability of these technologies.

AB Recent technological developments have enabled a wide array of new applications in financial markets, e.g. big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and robo-advising, inter alia. While traditionally comprising of computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services, the new fintech sector is often seen as enabling transformation of the financial industry. A more moderate and critical view suggests that for the full transformative potential of fintech to be enabled, there is a need for an updated educational curriculum that balances knowledge and understanding of finance and technology. A curriculum that provides a skill portfolio in the two core components and complements them with applied knowledge can support the enabling forces which will render fintech as a true opportunity for the financial service industry and for society as a whole. We attempt a scholarship inquiry into the educational curriculum in finance and technology, aiming to inform this modern educational agenda. We review skills shortages, as identified by firms and experts, and examine the state-of-the art by some of the first educational programs in fintech.

AB Purpose Over last few years, a major innovation known as blockchain technology has emerged as potentially one of the most disruptive technology of recent times. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze various critical success factors (CSFs) that can facilitate success of blockchain-based cloud services. Further, this paper aims to analyze and understand mutual interactions among these CSFs.
   Design/methodology/approach In this paper, 19 CSFs have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The hierarchical framework developed using total interpretive structural modeling has revealed the inter-dependencies among these CSFs. The methodology employed in this study provides a mechanism to conduct an exploratory study by identifying the factors and analyzing their interactions through the development of a hierarchical framework. This research further categorizes CSFs into multiple clusters based on their driving power and dependence power.
   Findings This paper has identified 19 CSFs, namely, user engagement, industry collaboration, rich ecosystem, blockchain technology standardization, regulatory clarity, cost efficiency, energy efficiency (wasted resources), handling blockchain bloat, miner incentives, business case alignment to blockchain capability, sidechains development, blockchain talent pool availability, leadership readiness for a decentralized consensus based technology, technology investment and maturity, trust on blockchain networks, integration with other cloud services, robust and mature smart contracts platform, blockchain security and user control on data (privacy). Further, driver and dependent variables have been identified.
   Research limitations/implications Future research can discover and detail the sub-factors behind the 19 CSFs identified in this paper. Additionally, more work can be done to extend the current structural model for blockchain-based services to a more functional form.
   Practical implications It provides a comprehensive list of CSFs that are relevant for development of blockchain-based cloud services. This will help industry leaders to strategically focus on the main drivers that will ensure that businesses get maximum benefit of this disruptive technology.
   Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution in the literature of blockchain-based cloud services, which captures the perspective of different stakeholders. This study is one of the first (if not the first) systematic research on adoption of blockchain-based services. It creates the foundation to carry out further research in this area.

AB At present, the domestic securities registration is basically controlled by third parties, and it is not necessary to be identified after the transaction. Therefore, if a third party's operating platform is maliciously attacked, it may change some of the information on the equity securities asset. Block chain application technology can transfer securities assets in the network system to check whether the security of securities assets through the P2P system. As the entire stock transaction process is stored in the block chain, the risk can be greatly reduced; the application of block chain technology can effectively prevent the securities assets from being tampered with in the course of the transaction. Aiming at the problem that the block chain technology is used to prevent the data from being tampered with in the course of the transaction, the storage system of securities trading based on block chain was proposed. Transactions of securities assets based on block chains were realized through the design of the system. The system was designed by using Java technology. Block chains were used as a basis for design ideas, and securities transactions were written into block chains and transferred to database.

AB The financial services industry has been experiencing the recent emergence of new technology innovations and process disruptions. The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the Fintech Revolution is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

ID EMERGENCE
AB Imagine meeting a stranger and entering into a trusted economic exchange without needing a third party to vouch for you. What changes in your theoretical perspective in such a world? That model of interaction is what distributed trust technologies such as blockchain bring. I introduce the basic concept of distributed trust, describe some early instances, and highlight how organizational theories need to be updated to no longer rely upon fundamental assumptions about trust which are becoming outdated. Distributed trust fundamentally transforms boundaries of organizations and challenges assumptions about internalizing organizational functions to overcome market trust coordination issues. Implicit assumptions about the legitimacy and power of central network positions no longer ring true. This is very fertile ground for organizations research as the core tenet of the fieldwhat roles and functions should group together within an organizationis being called into question at the most fundamental level.

SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL

ID MODEL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the intelligence and investigatory challenges experienced by law enforcement agencies in discovering the identity of illicit Bitcoin users and the transactions that they perform. This paper proposes solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in piecing together the disparate and complex technical, behavioural and criminological elements that make up cybercriminal offending.
   Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to highlight the main law enforcement challenges and discussions and examine current discourse in the areas of anonymity and attribution. The paper also looked at other research and projects that aim to identify illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the darknet.
   Findings An optimal solution would be one which has a predictive capability and a machine learning architecture which automatically collects and analyses data from the Bitcoin blockchain and other external data sources and applies search criteria matching, indexing and clustering to identify suspicious behaviours. The implementation of a machine learning architecture would help improve results over time and would be less manpower intensive. Cyber investigators would also receive intelligence in a format and language that they understand and it would allow for intelligence-led and predictive policing rather than reactive policing. The optimal solution would be one which allows for intelligence-led, predictive policing and enables and encourages information sharing between multiple stakeholders from the law enforcement, financial intelligence units, cyber security organisations and fintech industry. This would enable the creation of red flags and behaviour models and the provision of up-to-date intelligence on the threat landscape to form a viable intelligence product for law enforcement agencies so that they can more easily get to the who, what, when and where.
   Originality/value The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detected suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network.

TI Case study of Lykke exchange: architecture and outlook
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; Alternative trading systems; Coloured coins
AB Purpose This paper aims to explain the architecture and design choices of the exchange. Lykke is a FinTech company based in Zurich that has launched the global marketplace for all asset classes and instruments digitized on the blockchain. The authors discuss how the exchange will evolve over time. They explore the macroeconomic benefits of the new blockchain technology. The Lykke exchange is compatible with any type of public blockchain.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors present the architecture of an exchange for colored coins. By colored coins, they mean issuer-backed securities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Orders are collected and matched by a semi-trusted exchange. Matched orders are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, where each successful trade between parties appears as a set atomic-colored coins swap transactions. Unfilled and expired orders are discarded. The exchange does not take possession of the traded coins, but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly.
   Findings Lykke has launched the exchange initially for the main currencies, cryptocurrencies and Lykke coin (entitlement to the shares of Lykke company). Perspective asset classes include futures and options on digital assets, crowd-funded loans for retail and private equity financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, contracts for difference, zero coupon bonds and other fixed income and natural capital bonds.
   Originality/value Lykke exchange and all its tools and services are open source; the transparency of technology is ideal for research. The paper provides a high-level overview of the exchange and concludes with a research agenda.

TI An innovative RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and
   supervisory reporting
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Smart contracts; Algorithmic standards; Document engineering; RegTech
ID NETWORKS; FINTECH; BANKS
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a bearer service, which generates and maintains a digital doppelganger for every financial contract in the form of a dynamic transaction document that is a standardised data facility automatically making important contract data from the transaction counterparties available to relevant authorities mandated by law to request and process such data. This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time.
   Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the bearer service and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988).
   Findings The result is a transformation of supervisors' capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology.
   Practical implications The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting.
   Originality value The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality.

DE Business analysis; Bitcoin; Network theory; Blockchain; Digital
   currencies; Payment traceability
AB Purpose This paper aims to gather together the minimum units of users' identity in the Bitcoin network (i.e. the individual Bitcoin addresses) and group them into representations of business entities, what we call super clusters. While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises.
   Design/methodology/approach Data mining.
   Findings Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a one-day holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce.
   Originality/value The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called super clusters, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them.

AB Purpose Building on the multi-divisional business model (M-model), the purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of triadic business models - T-models - and how they create value for their three categories of stakeholders, i.e., the suppliers, the platform firm and the buyers. The research question that guides the present study is twofold: How is value created individually and collectively in triadic business models and what might challenge their sustainability?
   Design/methodology/approach Anchored in extant literature and a process of conceptual modeling with empirical examples from Uber, a new business model archetype was developed for two-sided markets mediated by a middleman.
   Findings The paper provides a theoretically and conceptually derived roadmap for sustainable business in a triadic business model, i.e., for the buyers, sellers and the platform firm. This model is coined the T-model. A number of propositions are derived that argue the relationship between key constructs. Finally, the future beyond the T-model is explored.
   Research limitations/implications The paper identifies, illustrates and discusses the ways in which value is created in sustainable T-models. First, value is created from a number of sources, not only from lower transaction costs. Second, it is proposed that it is not about a choice of either M-model or T-model but rather a continuum. Toward 2050, technology in general and Blockchain specifically may for some transactions or services, eliminate the need for middlemen. The main conclusion is that despite this development, there will, for most organizations, be elements of the M-model in all or most T-model businesses. In short: middlemen will have elements of the M-model embedded in the T-model when co creating value with buyers and sellers.
   Originality/value While two-sided T-models are not new to the business area, surprisingly no papers have systematically investigated, illustrated, and discussed how value is created among and between the three stakeholder categories of the T-model. With this insight, more sustainable T-models can be created.

AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the accelerated development of cyber-physical technologies lead to essential changes in national tax systems and international taxation. The main areas in which taxation meets cyber-physical technologies are digitalization, robotization, M2M and blockchain technologies. Each of these areas has its own opportunities and problems. Three main approaches towards possible solutions for these new problems are identified. The first is to try to apply taxation to new cyber-physical technologies and products of their application. This approach includes the OECD's Action 1 Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. It also includes the spread of traditional taxes on new objects - personal data, cryptocurrencies, imputed income of robots. The second is to replace digital transactions and shortfalls in revenues by traditional objects of taxation in the form of tangible assets and people and / or increase tax pressure (including by improving tax administration with use of Big Data) and the degree of progressiveness of taxes already levied on such objects. The third approach is to set a course on building a new tax space with smart taxes based on real-time principles, smart contracts and Big Data. This implies a transition to automatic taxation using blockchain technologies, which focus on the functions of applying distributed ledgers of business transactions in real-time. At present, the general trends are such that the first and second are prevalent, which is manifested in an increase in the relative importance of property, sales and employment taxes. Concerning the third approach, any movement in this direction is still facing a number of technical and other problems and is thus being discussed mainly at the conceptual level

AB In a globalizing world of digitalization and automation, change is inevitable. With the use of the blockchain technology, the public and private sector can be subject to an enormous transformation and such potential could influence them in all areas of life. The question of how and how to apply such technology in the development process in the field of taxation has also showed up synchronously. This study aims to offer blockchain technology-based solutions that could help overcome the challenges faced in taxation issue. Within this scope, the fields in which the blockchain technology could be primarily used in taxation will be studied in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.

ID CLOUD; ALGORITHM; SCHEME
AB In this paper, the blockchain technology is utilized to build the first incentive mechanism of nodes as per data storage for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In our system, the nodes storing the data are rewarded with digital money. The more the data stored by the node, the more the reward it achieves. Moreover, two blockchains are constructed. One is utilized to store data of each node and another is to control the access of data. In addition, our proposal adopts the provable data possession to replace the proof of work (PoW) in original bitcoins to carry out the mining and storage of new data blocks, which greatly reduces the computing power comparing to the PoW mechanism. Furthermore, the preserving hash functions are used to compare the stored data and the new data block. The new data can be stored in the node which is closest to the existing data, and only the different subblocks are stored. Thus, it can greatly save the storage space of network nodes.

AB Since the generation of Bitcoin, it has gained attention of all sectors of the society. Law breakers committed crimes by utilizing the anonymous characteristics of Bitcoin. Recently, how to track malicious Bitcoin transactions has been proposed and studied. To address the challenge, existing solutions have limitations in accuracy, comprehensiveness, and efficiency. In this paper, we study Bitcoin blackmail virus WannaCry event incurred in May 2017. The three Bitcoin addresses disclosed in this blackmail event are only restricted to receivers accepting Bitcoin sent by victims, and no further transaction has been found yet. Therefore, we acquire and verify experimental data by example of similar Bitcoin blackmail virus CryptoLocker occurred in 2013. We focus on how to track malicious Bitcoin transactions, and adopt a new heuristic clustering method to acquire incidence relation between addresses of Bitcoin and improved Louvain clustering algorithm to further acquire incidence relation between users. In addition, through a lot of experiments, we compare the performance of our algorithm with another related work. The new heuristic clustering method can improve comprehensiveness and accuracy of the results. The improved Louvain clustering algorithm can increase working efficiency. Specifically, we propose a method acquiring internal relationship between Bitcoin addresses and users, so as to make Bitcoin transaction deanonymisation possible, and realize a better utilization of Bitcoin in the future.

AB Traditionally, the annual report opens the World Professional Crimea Forum. Primarily, the speaker focuses on the concept of digital economy interpreted as the economic relations system based on the digital information and communication technologies. The Program "Digital economy of the Russian Federation" is reviewed. Several concepts, e.g. bitcoin and blockchain, Industry 4.0, New Internet, etc., are defined.
   The current problems of the Internet are examined, in particular, the lack of the single management and development center. The statistical data on the profile and involvement of the internet users is reported. Special attention is given to using Internet in Russia and the related problem of copyright in Russia and worldwide.
   The role of open access in building the knowledge environment and the role of the main contributors to the process, namely, publishers, libraries, educational institutions, are emphasized. Online education and accessible seamless education environment are specified as the main trends in education,
   The key vectors of developing knowledge content and its application in the digital environment are defined, these are: inclusiveness, artificial intelligence and green (sustainable) libraries, etc.
   The current situation in the global book market is evaluated on the basis of the results of the London Book Fair 2018.
   The project "The modern digital educational environment in the Russian Federation" is examined along with the projected results. The role of the National Electronic Library as the major innovative library project and the national information system is emphasized. The author concludes that the libraries of the future become an essential part of the national and global information infrastructure.

AB In this paper will be presented new opportunities for developing innovative solutions based on blockchain technologies in creation of new data management algorithms, especially those focused on the distribution and processing of data in layered structures, where independent instances can fully control and verify all operations. Later an attempt will be made to generalize protocols, which will be proposed for management activities, towards their extension and the possibility of using them in hierarchical structures. Blockchain technology should enable the development of decentralized management protocols that will allow complete verifiability of all operations by all authorized parties that can collect, process and transmit such information. In practice such protocols will give the opportunity to create an effective and secure data sharing protocols in structures, where all authorized entities are equal and can independently verify the type of operations and instances that process such data.

AB Recently, public interest in the blockchain technology has surged and various applications based on the technology have emerged. However, there has been little study on architectural evaluations of popular block chain platforms that can help the developers choose an appropriate architecture matching their needs. In this paper, we reconstruct and evaluate the architecture of Hyperledger and Ethereum, which are representative open source platforms for blockchain. The evaluation results indicate that Hyperledger is strong in modifiability and performance whereas Ethereum is better in security.

DE Cloud forensic problem; GDPR; Blockchain/bitcoin technology
ID BITCOIN; ECONOMICS
AB A great many cloud users face a difficult challenge in respect of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect on 25th May, 2018. While all computer systems are continuously under attack, those who operate conventional distributed network systems stand a far greater chance of being able to demonstrate compliance than those who use cloud based systems. The main reason for this discrepancy between the two approaches is down to the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem, meaning many cloud users will be completely unable to demonstrate compliance with the new regulation, thus exposing themselves to potentially massive fines after 25th May. We consider the possible use of a crypto-currency based mechanism to address the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem. Crypto-currencies are becoming a global phenomenon, gaining more attention from media, venture capitalists, financial and government institutions. We focus on the operational risk and the market risk related to crypto-currencies, especially the dominating Bitcoin. Operational risk encompasses the actions that undermine the technological infrastructure and security assumptions of crypto-currencies. We discuss how blockchain technology could improve the efficiency of financial infrastructures, as well as the inevitable vulnerabilities of operational risk of software, open-source governance, and code maintenance. We summarise the literature findings on the co-movement of cryptocurrencies with different currencies, indices, and commodities, to show the role of crypto-currency as a commodity, currency, or a speculative investment under portfolio diversification theory. Particularly now that we have seen successful attacks on cryptocurrencies in action, it is important to understand where these weaknesses lie, and to endeavour to find out to what extent the use of such technology might expose companies using this technology for GDPR compliance. In the light of the robustness of this approach, we consider whether the underlying blockchain technology could, in turn, be practically applied to addressing the cloud forensic problem. This paper looks at the pros and cons of the blockchain/bitcoin approach, seeking to identify weaknesses, potential benefits offered versus the additional resource costs/latency involved, and considers whether such an approach might be used to secure cloud forensic trails.

DE Blockchain; data security; next generation wireless communication;
   non-orthogonal multiple access; successive interference cancellation
AB Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive interference cancellation receiver is considered as one of the most potent multiple access techniques to be adopted in future wireless communication networks. Data security in the NOMA transmission scheme is on much attention drawing issue. Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer network enables a way of protecting information from unauthorized access, tempering etc. By utilizing encryption techniques of blockchain, a secured data communication scheme using blockchain in NOMA is proposed in this paper. A two-phase encryption technique with key generation using different parameter is proposed. In the first-phase data is encrypted by imposing users' public key and in the second phase, a private key of the base station (BS) is engaged for encryption. Finally, the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing scheme is proven through a comparative study based on the different features.

DE E-auction; Public Bid; Sealed Bid; Blockchain; Smart Contract
AB Because of the popularity of the Internet, the integration services have gradually changed people daily life, such as e-commerce activities on transactions, transportation and so on. The E-auction, one of the popular e-commerce activities, allows bidders to directly bid the products over the Internet. As for sealed bid, the extra transaction cost is required for the intermediaries because the third-party is the important role between the buyers and the sellers help to trade both during the auction. In addition, it never guarantees whether the third-party is trust. To resolve the problems, the blockchain technology with low transaction cost is used to develop the smart contract of public bid and sealed bid. The smart contract, proposed in 1990 and implements via Ethereum platform, can ensure the bill secure, private, non-reputability and inalterability owing to all the transactions are recorded in the same but decentralized ledgers. The smart contract is composed of the address of Auctioneer, the start auction time, deadline, the address of current winner, the current highest price. In the experiments, the accounts are created through Ethereum wallet. In miner stage, the MinerGate is used in miner stage for obtaining money to pay the transaction fee. At recorder stage, the nodes of blockchain are synchronized to generate smart contract.

AB The blockchain architecture with distributed and decentralized as the main features often face problems such as long transaction confirmation time, low system throughput, and waste of computing resources. These problems are exactly what the traditional centralized architecture can solve. At the same time, in order to improve the distributed consensus efficiency, consensus algorithms such as Proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, proof of space, proof of authority, and PBFT have emerged from Bitcoin's Pow consensus mechanism. These consensus algorithms have their own advantages and Disadvantages. Disadvantages, such as Pos, DPos can improve transaction efficiency, PBFT can improve the fairness of voting, but at the same time POS also bring benefits and voting rights to hold a lot of user tilt issues to a small number of tokens, PBFT brings about a low cost of malicious user attacks and other issues. In order to effectively take advantage of the high security, high reliability of the blockchain, and high efficiency of traditional centralized architectures, and fully utilizing existing consensus mechanisms, this paper presents an innovative hybrid blockchain approach, which mixed the blockchain architecture, Hybrid-chain, consists of the following three type nodes in the architecture: service center nodes responsible for efficient transaction confirmation, dynamic transaction verification nodes participating in transactions, and random verification nodes responsible for transaction fairness verification. On the consensus mechanism, the consensus algorithm selects the corresponding consensus mechanism according to the transaction characteristics. Experiments show that compared with the traditional blockchain architecture, hybrid chain has obvious performance advantages in transaction sending, transaction confirmation and block information storage, which can greatly reduce the transaction sending time by 96%, shorten the confirmation time by 95%, and reduce the number of 79. % Block information storage space, etc.

   attribute-based encryption; blockchain
AB In this paper, we present a prototype of multi-user system for access control to datasets stored in an untrusted cloud environment. Cloud storage like any other untrusted environment needs the ability to secure share information. Our approach provides an access control over the data stored in the cloud without the provider participation. The main tool of access control mechanism is ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with dynamic attributes. Using a blockchain-based decentralized ledger, our system provides immutable log of all meaningful security events, such as key generation, access policy assignment, change or revocation, access request. We propose a set of cryptographic protocols ensuring privacy of cryptographic operations requiring secret or private keys. Only ciphertexts of hash codes are transferred through the blockchain ledger. The prototype of our system is implemented using smart contracts and tested on Ethereum blockchain platform.

DE warehouse receipt transaction; blockchain; smart contract; distributed
   ledger; PBFT consensus algorithm
AB To solve the credibility and supervision lacking problem in the OTC warehouse receipt trading system, a scheme of using smart contract on the blockchain to implement the OTC warehouse receipt trading system is presented. As a distributed ledger, blockchain has the advantages of decentralization, irreversibility and trustworthiness. The warehouse receipt transaction data is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring its safety and credibility. Smart contract is automatically executed code stored on the blockchain, it can directly control the transaction of digital assets. No participant can control and tamper it before the contract is lapsed. In the process of using the Ethereum smart contract to realize warehouse receipt transactions, consensus is reached by the PBFT consensus algorithm, Since the trusted third-party is not needed, the lack of supervision problem is solved. This paper introduces the application of blockchain and smart contract to the OTC warehouse receipt trading system. It includes the design of smart contracts, the verification of smart contracts security. This paper also verifies the feasibility of designing smart contracts by using the instance of listed transactions.

DE Bitcoin; virtual currency; supervision
AB In order to explore the virtual currency supervision and compare the differences of it in different countries, taking bitcoin as an example, first of all, the measurements for supervising bitcoin are compared between China and America. In addition, the causes for the difference are further analyzed from social nature, Internet financial mode, and bitcoin industry. Based on this, the countermeasures for China to strengthen bitcoin supervision are put forward. The results showed that the factors for different supervision ideas are various. For the macro level, it includes social system; and for the micro level, it involves consumer's consumption concept. As a result, it is concluded that it is necessary to fully combine with the national conditions and efficiently absorb advanced concept when learning and studying supervision systems with Chinese characteristics.

AB Virtual currencies are a new phenomenon that is increasingly affecting both national and international legal traffic. Their rapid spread requires the conception of a prevention model in order to deter its utilization in criminal activities and protect the users. This paper examines the technology of virtual currencies and studies its relevant characteristics from the standpoint of criminal law and criminology. The analysis emphasizes the risk increase it causes regarding highly complex criminal offenses, particularly money laundering. The paper criticizes the usage of conventional models for its regulation, and concludes with a new preventive regulatory approach that is consistent with the nature and modus operandi of this new technology.

AB With the fast development of mobile Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) has been found in many important applications recently. However, it still faces many challenges in security and privacy. Blockchain (BC) technology, which underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has played an important role in the development of decentralized and data intensive applications running on millions of devices. In this paper, to establish the relationship between IoT and BC for device credibility verification, we propose a framework with layers, intersect, and self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS). In this new framework, each BCS is organized by Blockchain technology. We describe the credibility verification method and show how it provide the verification. The efficiency and security analysis are also given in this paper, including its response time, storage efficiency, and verification. The conducted experiments have been shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in satisfying the credible requirement achieved by Blockchain technology and certain advantages in storage space and response time.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that became popular as the foundational block of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Over the past few years it has seen a rapid growth, both in terms of research and commercial usage. Due to its decentralized nature and its inherent use of cryptography, Blockchain provides an elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem and is thus a good candidate for use in areas that require a decentralized consensus among untrusted peers, eliminating the need for a central authority. Internet of Things is a technology paradigm where a multitude of small devices, including sensors, actuators and RFID tags, are interconnected via a common communications medium to enable a whole new range of tasks and applications. However, existing IoT installations are often vulnerable and prone to security and privacy concerns. This paper studies the use of Blockchain to strengthen the security of IoT networks through a resilient, decentralized mechanism for the connected home that enhances the network self-defense by safeguarding critical security-related data. This mechanism is developed as part of the Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) project.

AB In this paper, we investigate the use of decentralized blockchain mechanisms for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand profiles of Distributed Energy Prosumers, to all the stakeholders involved in the flexibility markets (Distribution System Operators primarily, retailers, aggregators, etc.). In our approach, a blockchain based distributed ledger stores in a tamper proof manner the energy prosumption information collected from Internet of Things smart metering devices, while self-enforcing smart contracts programmatically define the expected energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the associated rewards or penalties, and the rules for balancing the energy demand with the energy production at grid level. Consensus based validation will be used for demand response programs validation and to activate the appropriate financial settlement for the flexibility providers. The approach was validated using a prototype implemented in an Ethereum platform using energy consumption and production traces of several buildings from literature data sets. The results show that our blockchain based distributed demand side management can be used for matching energy demand and production at smart grid level, the demand response signal being followed with high accuracy, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for convergence is reduced.

AB The purpose of this article is to examine the contemporary developments of the global digital trends and investigate the most perspective digital technologies crucial for international companies. The relevance of foresight methodology application is justified. The paper's focus is on future trends of digital technologies by providing a brief literature review in the fields of digital technologies and relevant marketing resources. Key assumptions, expectations and uncertainties about the future are re-evaluated. It is justified that long-term thinking is crucial to frame future strategies not only for governments and citizens but also for both small and international companies. Three global trends within the field of digital technologies are investigated: artificial intelligence, block chain and big data. The marketing resources which are currently arising and developing with the highest potential of dominating and revolutionizing the future of marketing are described: internet of things, social media, virtual and augmented reality. The author used the example of augmented reality expansion and development as one of the most promising global trends. Survey methodology was applied to evaluate the potential of augmented reality (AR) application using one of the most promising international industry adopters: the tourism industry. The AR mobile apps generated $ 2 billion in revenue as of the end of 2016 and according to the investigations the AR market could grow to $ 120 billion by 2020. The research results have shown that 84% to 100% of generation Y & Z consumers, whose consumption patterns would shape future demand, see clear benefits in using augmented reality applications in tourism industry.

AB Purpose This paper aims to strive to close the current research gap pertaining to potential implications of the blockchain for supply chain management (SCM) by presenting a framework built on four established economic theories, namely, principal agent theory (PAT), transaction cost analysis (TCA), resource-based view (RBV) and network theory (NT). These theories can be used to derive research questions that are theory-based as well as relevant for the industry. This paper is intended to initiate and stimulate an academic discussion on the potential impact of the blockchain and introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on previous theories that are frequently used in SCM research and shows how they can be adapted to blockchain-related questions.
   Findings This paper introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions.
   Research limitations/implications The paper presents blockchain-related research questions derived from four frequently used theories, namely, PAT, TCA, RBV and (NT). These questions will guide future research pertaining to structural (PAT, TCA) and managerial issues (RBV, NT) and will foster middle-range theory development in SCM research.
   Practical implications Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly change SCM. Given the huge investments by industry, academic research is needed which investigates potential implications and supports companies. In this paper, various research questions are introduced that illustrate how the implications of blockchain on SCM can be investigated from different perspectives.
   Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, no academic papers are published in leading academic journals that investigate the relationship between SCM and blockchain from a theory-based perspective.

AB The aim of this study is to review the literature growth and author productivity of Blockchain technology research from 2008 to March 2017. 801 articles were retrieved from Scopus database and analyzed with bibliometrics approach using different perspective views. The author productivity was derived using the Lotka's law and K-S test was performed to verify the reliability. The result indicates that the number of literatures on Blockchain is still increasing. Three stages of Blockchain research change were discovered. In 2008 to 2013, the topics were related to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; in 2014 to 2015, the number of Bitcoin literatures grew rapidly; after 2016, a lot of researchers are paying attention to the techniques of Blockchain and smart contract. Moreover, the distribution of author productivity meets the study of Lotka. This study presents state-of-the-art and abstract the trend of Blockchain research regarding several perspectives of bibliometrics analysis.

DE Authentication; Art Markets; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Coase Theorem;
   Cryptocurrency; Peter Doig (b; 1959); Ether; Ethereum; Fractional
   Ownership; Robert Rauschenberg (1925-2008)
AB The events of 2016 in which the painter Peter Doig (b. 1959) was sued in US Federal Court for failing to authenticate an artwork for a speculative investor encapsulate a view of the art world from the perspective of collectors and not artists. This paper imagines what would happen if artists were to retain 10% equity in their work in the primary market, rather than receive resale royalties in the secondary market. This idea applies the Coase Theorem in economics, concerning the relationship of property rights, pricing, and trade. Accordingly, those equity shares could trade in a standalone marketplace well before an artwork was sold, providing patronage for artists and more diversifiable art fund structures for investors. Technological systems such as the blockchain (e.g. bitcoin) make such a system timely, by providing cheap accounting and automatic provenance. This proposal stands in stark contrast to much of the writing on resale royalties, which treats payments to artists as welfare or subsidy, or emphasizes a lack of enforceability. In fact, assigning equity shares to artists allows them to participate more accurately, from a free-market-economics standpoint, in the value that their work creates. This realignment of price and value could radically alter and also stabilize the art market in relation to both recent financial crises and the increasing financialization of art objects. Such a system has broad applications to the alignment of price and value in many other sectors of creative work, and beyond.

DT Article
AB Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing are increasingly integrated, in the sense that data collected from IoT devices (generally with limited computational and storage resources) are being sent to the cloud for processing, etc., in order to inform decision making and facilitate other operational and business activities. However, the cloud may not be a fully trusted entity, like leaking user data or compromising user privacy. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving and user-controlled data sharing architecture with fine-grained access control, based on the blockchain model and attribute-based cryptosystem. Also, the consensus algorithm in our system is the Byzantine fault tolerance mechanism, rather than Proof of Work.

AB This paper presents an innovative and open software framework whose goal is to increase the trust of blockchain transactions. Transactions are signed by the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) associated with a 32 bytes secret private key. We designed a Javacard application used for key generation, storage and cryptographic procedure dealing with the secp256k1 elliptic curve. Our open software BTOOLS generates Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions whose trust is enforced by the support of a Crypto Currency SmartCard (CCSC).

AB The recent explosion of interest in blockchains led to a plethora of proposals for their application, including attempts to decentralize some centralized network functions. At the same time, real "distributed wireless networks" are emerging. Community networks, for instance, are large mesh networks made of hundreds of nodes built by communities primarily to solve digital divide, and they are thriving. The challenges these networks face are not only technological: they deal with creating incentives to participate, with the business model they may adopt, and with their internal governance. Very few models have been proposed to apply blockchains to bottom-up distributed networks: we instead expose how they can solve many problems which so far hindered the diffusion of such networks. Maybe we can push this further: a network is, in essence, a system in which all nodes find a rough consensus on the best paths to connect a node with another. Can we use this consensus method to run a distributed ledger and a cryptocurrency within the network itself, rather than simply applying to networks the effects of a blockchain defined in a separate system? This paper introduces this concept, named "Proof of Networking", and discusses its potential avails.

AB The current e-business information retrieval system ignores the threat of distributed denial of service attack from computer network, which results in low retrieval recall, accuracy, and efficiency. For this problem, a design method of fuzzy retrieval system for e-business information based on block chain technology is proposed in this paper. A fuzzy retrieval system of e-business information is designed, which includes three layers of client, application server and data server. The construction rules of the rule library used by the system are researched. The keyword expansion method of association word list, compound word list and synonymous word list is given. The dynamic knowledge base of the system is built and updated in real-time. Security control of e-business information documents in the system is implemented by using anti-attack performance of block chain technology. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the recall, accuracy and average accuracy of the system and the retrieval efficiency is high.

AB On an EU level, the topic of electronic health data is a high priority. Many projects have been developed to realise a standard health data format to share information on a regional, national or EU level. All the projects favour and contribute to the development and improvement of the prerequisites for intra- and cross-border patient mobility. This work presents a new approach for the implementation of disruptive logging: an audit mechanism for cross-border exchange of eHealth data on OpenNCP, providing traceability and liability support within the OpenNCP infrastructure. Relevant parties could be legally obliged to keep a log of all privacy-critical operations performed by OpenNCP users.

AB Purpose Nowadays, to operate securely and legally and to achieve business objectives, secure valuable assets and support uninterrupted business processes, all organizations need to match a lot of internal and external compliance regulations such as laws, standards, guidelines, policies, specifications and procedures. An integrated system able to manage information security (IS) for their intranets in the new cyberspace while processing tremendous amounts of IS-related data coming in various formats is required as never before. These data, after being collected and analyzed, should be evaluated in real-time from an IS incident viewpoint, to identify an incident's source, consider its type, weigh its consequences, visualize its vector, associate all target systems, prioritize countermeasures and offer mitigation solutions with weighted impact relevance. Different security information and event management (SIEM) systems cope with this routine and usually complicated work by rapid detection of IS incidents and further appropriate response. Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the blockchain (BC) technologies (BCTs). The purpose of this study is to design a new BC-based SIEM 3.0 system and propose a methodology for its evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the BC technologies. Many internet resources argue that the BCT suits the intrusion detection objectives very well, but they do not mention how to implement it.
   Findings After a brief analysis of the BC concept and the evolution of SIEM systems, this paper presents the main ideas on designing the next-generation BC-based SIEM 3.0 systems, for the first time in open access publications, including a convolution method for solving the scalability issue for ever-growing BC size. This new approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future.
   Research limitations/implications The most important area of the future work is to bring this proposed system to life. The implementation, deployment and testing onto a real-world network would also allow people to see its viability or show that a more sophisticated model should be worked out. After developing the design basics, we are ready to determine the directions of the most promising studies. What are the main criteria and principles, according to which the organization will select events from PEL for creating one BC block? What is the optimal number of nodes in the organization's BC, depending on its network assets, services provided and the number of events that occur in its network? How to build and host the SIEM 3.0 BC infrastructure? How to arrange streaming analytics of block's content containing events taking place in the network? How to design the BC middleware as software that enables staff to interact with BC blocks to provide services like IS events correlation? How to visualize the results obtained to find insights and patterns in historical BC data for better IS management? How to predict the emergence of IS events in the future? This list of questions can be continued indefinitely for a full-fledged design of SIEM 3.0.
   Practical implications This paper shows the full applicability of the BC concept to the creation of the next-generation SIEM 3.0 systems that are designed to detect IS incidents in a modern, fully interconnected organization's network environment. The authors' attempt to begin with a detailed description of the basics for a BC-based SIEM 3.0 system design is presented, as well as the evaluation methodology for the resulting product.
   Originality/value The authors believe that their new revolutionary approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future. They hope that this paper will evoke a lively response in this segment of the security controls market from both theorists and direct developers of living systems that will implement the above approach.

AB Bitcoin has emerged as a disruptive technology able to revolutionize the way financial transactions are performed. The static analysis of the Bitcoin's blockchain conducted jointly with a real time analysis of the Bitcoin's Peer-to-Peer network can reveal interesting properties of the Bitcoin's ecosystem.
   In this paper we propose BitKer, a Bitcoin kernel client able to interact with the Peer-to-Peer network to retrieve information useful to support higher level analyses. BitKer offers an API to applications requiring an interaction with the underlying network, for instance to implement deanonymization strategies. In this work, we present a first set of experimental results obtained by three different logs, the last one of them obtained just after the August 2017 Bitcoin Cash hard fork. Results show that BitKer is effective in retrieving useful information and can be easily used as a basis for more complex analysis tools.

AB This review focuses on the evolution of cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies (blockchains) over the last decade. Cloud computing relies mainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while blockchain technologies originate from a peer-to-peer and a completely distributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches are often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors knowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We conclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of distributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting question whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages can be added while the disadvantages could be avoided. We derive a software stack that could build the foundation unifying the best of these two worlds and that would avoid existing shortcomings like vendor lock-in, some security problems, and inherent platform dependencies.

AB Although the current Domain Name System (DNS) is already mature enough and widely used, there are still some fundamental problems for the future Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) Aiming at altering the centralized domain name management model in DNS, we propose a decentralized and distributed domain name system based on Blockchain, which is named as DNSLedger. DNSLedger implements the features of common maintenance, node equivalence and so on. This paper will make a brief introduction of DNSLedger and analyze what advantages the proposed model has.

DE Blockchain; local energy market; scalability; market design
AB Local energy markets could play a very important role in future electric power systems, allowing small electricity producers/consumers to trade within a small geographical area. In this context, an important challenge to allow the proper operation of a local energy market is to devise efficient and economic computational platforms in charge of data storage, data communication, and any other relevant computational requirements. Fortunately, the recent developments in blockchain-based mechanisms open up promising approaches that can support the effective management of local energy markets. In fact, blockchain technology allows, in particular, to carry out decentralised payments without involving a third party in charge of keeping track of the trades performed, which can potentially simplify and enhance the management of a local energy market significantly. Motivated by this, this paper will study the use of the blockchain-based Ethereum platform as the computational support for a local energy market. Specifically, this paper addresses the scalability of this platform in terms of number of participants in the local energy market, and in terms of trading frequency. With this purpose, computer simulations are carried out for a market that consists of day-ahead trading and real-time trading. The day-ahead mechanism trades energy quantities in such a way that flexible demand can be shifted to balance inflexible supply, and the real-time mechanism trades energy in such a way that flexible loads cover deviations from the day-ahead settlement. The results illustrate that the Ethereum platform is sufficiently scalable, allowing to manage a local energy market with a large number of participants and a high trading frequency.

AB Blockchain technology is already being talked about as one of the megatrends for the next years. Researchers and organisations are starting to understand the potential benefits of this technology and are exploring how it can disrupt the world we live in with a diverse range of applications. But the truth is the ability to move blockchain from concept to adoption and production has been minimal yet. When it comes to auditing, blockchain solutions could have important benefits by reducing the workload of the auditors, helping in minimising fraud and optimising the existing processes but is also vital to have in mind other emerging technologies. Factom, Libra, and Verady are some examples of companies developing blockchain solutions that can be applied in the auditing environment, but much of the necessary development is still yet to be done.

DE Blockchain for wireless virtualization; secure wireless virtualization;
   dynamic spectrum allocation
AB Wireless network virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization to support exponentially increasing demand caused by emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To create virtual wireless networks (VWNs), there are no automated secure approaches for allocating RF spectrum to meet the dynamically changing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. In wireless networks, RF spectrum is shared among many users and the given RF spectrum could be easily overcrowded because of the over commitment of limited resources by the service providers. There is a direct incentive in terms of revenue to service providers to have more number of users. In this paper, we propose to leverage a distributed Blockchain - also known as a public ledger - based scheme to create VWNs where primary wireless resource-owners (PWROs) sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using machine-to-machine communication based on the service level agreements (SLAs) between PWROs and MVNOs. The proposed distributed Blockchain-based scheme provides security to participating PWROs and MVNOs as well as prevents PWROs from over committing their resources (that stops double spending) and helps MVNOs to meet the QoS requirements of their users. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or similar regulatory bodies in other countries participate in this framework by providing the guidelines and regulations about maximum power levels, licensing and geographic coverages, etc. This essentially helps users to meet their desired QoS requirements while complying the government regulations. Performance is evaluated using numerical results.

DE Blockchain; mobile commerce; Android application; mobile security
AB Mobile security has become more and more important due to the boom of mobile commerce (m-commerce). However, the development of m-commerce is facing many challenges regarding data security problems. Recently, blockchain has been introduced as an effective security solution deployed successfully in many applications in practice, such as, Bitcoin, cloud computing, and Internet-of-Things. In this paper, we introduce a new m-commerce application using blockchain technology, namely, MobiChain, to secure transactions in the m-commerce. Especially, in the MobiChain application, the mining processes can be executed efficiently on mobile devices using our proposed Android core module.

AB While the rapid development of IoT devices is changing our daily lives, some particular issues hinder the massive deployment of IoT devices. For example, current network ID management system cannot handle so many new terminals; there is no agreed security standards for IoT manufacturers to follow when designing their products. The whole IoT industry is expecting the breakthrough in network infrastructure and the development of novel security mechanisms that can enable the flexible, secure and reliable access and management of IoT devices. Bitcoin, first released in 2009, breeds the decentralized Blockchain technology. The decentralization, anonymity and proof of security characteristics of Blockchain can prevent collusion and single point failure of a centralized server. We believe that the application of Blockchain into the IoT system can clear the obstacles facing the development of IoT architecture and security. To this end, we propose an out-of-band two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices based on Blockchain infrastructure. We implemented the IoT and Blockchain integrated system with Eris Blockchain and equivalent computing devices to emulate IoT devices. The overheads to run Blockchain and smart contract services on the emulator devices are measured. The BeagleBone Black and Raspberry Pi 3 nodes have an average memory usage of 29.5M, and the CPU usage of 29.55% and 13.35%, respectively.

AB Tremendous amount of research is going on in the field of Intelligent vehicles (IVs)in industries and academics. Although, IV supports a better convenience for the society, but it also suffers from some concerns. Security is the major concern in Intelligent vehicle technology, due to its high exposure to data and information communication. The environment of the IV communication has many security vulnerabilities, which cannot be solved by Traditional Security approaches due to their fixed capabilities. Among security, trust, data accuracy and reliability of communication data in the communication channel are the other issues in IV communication. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer, distributed and decentralized technology which is used by the digital currency Bit-coin, to build trust and reliability and it has capability and is feasible to use Blockchain in IV Communication. In this paper, we propose, Blockchain based crypto Trust point (cTp) mechanism for IV communication. Using cTp in the IVs communication environment can provide IV data security and reliability. cTp mechanism accounts for the legitimate and illegitimate vehicles behavior, and rewarding thereby building trust among the vehicles. We also propose a reward based system using cTp (exchange of some cTp among IVs, during successful communication). We use blockchain technology in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) for the data management of the cTp. Using ITS, cTp details of every vehicle can be accessed ubiquitously by IVs. We evaluation, our proposal using the intersection use case scenario for intelligent vehicles communication.

AB Risk and Information System Control Framework in business includes the methods and processes to manage risks and seize opportunities which involve identifying particular risk events relevant to the objectives, assessing them in terms of likelihood and magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy, and monitoring progress. In order to provide better support for the backtracking, traceability, irreversibility, and credible requirements of risk registration table data in the framework, this paper proposes a blockchain-based risk and information system control framework A risk association tree is designed for combining summarized risk item ledgers with risk assessment ledgers and risk response ledgers based on the Merkle Tree. Three proposed smart contracts are used in risk identification, risk assessment, risk response and mitigation, and risk and control monitoring and reporting processes. We implement a prototype for this framework.

AB Secure and reliable management of identities has become one of the greatest challenges facing cloud computing today, mainly due to the huge number of new cloud-based applications generated by this model, which means more user accounts, passwords, and personal information to provision, monitor, and secure. Currently, identity federation is the most useful solution to overcome the aforementioned issues and simplify the user experience by allowing efficient authentication mechanisms and use of identity information from data distributed across multiple domains. However, this approach creates considerable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud service providers and their clients. Poor management of trust in federated identity management systems brings with it many security, privacy and interoperability issues, which contributes to the reluctance of organizations to move their critical identity data to the cloud. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel trust and identity management model based on the Blockchain for cloud identity management with security and privacy improvements

AB The paper starts from the connotation analysis of block-chain, and seriously discusses many problems existing in financial accounting, such as serious distortion of enterprise accounting information, unclear accounting responsibility of enterprise leaders, poor quality of auditing practice, and repeated supervision by government departments and government. The bureaucratic style of the department is serious, and the advantages of financial accounting supervision based on block-chain technology are proposed. It facilitates information tracking and improves the authenticity of accounting information, reduces the obstacles of corporate leadership to accounting supervision, and improves the quality of social auditing practice and auditing efficiency to avoid repeated supervision by government departments and to eliminate the bureaucracy of government departments.

AB Block chaining technology has rapidly become a new global hotspot after the Internet in the field of financial technology (Fintech), attracting close attention from governments, experts and scholars. In practice, the specific meaning of "financial science and technology"is different under different backgrounds, and there are differences and connections with the concept of "Internet finance"in China. Fintech (Financial Technology) is a financial innovation based on artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, block chain technology and mobile Internet technology. Financial technology (Fintech) has been developing rapidly because of its obvious advantages in boosting the development of Inclusive Finance. The development of Fintech has played a certain role in the transformation of traditional financial institutions and the innovation of business models. Fintech has promoted the innovation of regulatory mechanism and the innovation of regulatory framework. Financial technology is an innovative activity to transform the mode of production in financial industry by means of science and technology, and thus to improve financial productivity. The development of information technology provides a necessary prerequisite for financial and technological progress. Based on its characteristics of centralization, privacy and programmability, block chain technology has the possibility of innovating the traditional financial payment system theoretically.

   Internet
AB The fourth Industrial Revolution is finding its way into modern manufacturing sites. Assets with a certain degree of implemented communication technology will be enabled to interconnect and cooperate with practically every other entity via the Industrial Internet. An extreme amount of data and information will be exchanged all the time. Machines will be empowered to make crucial decisions autonomously influencing whole production processes. Erroneous, illegitimate or tampered data will lead to incorrect decisions and will be posing a huge threat to future strong cross-linked added value networks. An approach to tackle this issue comes from a technology called distributed ledger technology with its most known variant the "blockchain". Certain properties of blockchain technology are showing promising enhancements for industrial networks primarily in order to guarantee digital trust. In this paper, issues like the ability to scale and the adaption onto the requirements of industrial networks are investigated. It turns out that simulation approaches must be taken into consideration, and a first step for an implementation is presented.

AB The Plug-and-Produce concept requires that after connecting a new module to a system, the exchange of the configuration data takes place. As further operation of the system depends on this initialization procedure, it is necessary to ensure that the data presented by the system and the newly attached component is authentic. Therefore, we propose a new concept for secure Plug-and-Produce functionality, which exploits the combination of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and Blockchain technology. On the one hand, the AAS shall be responsible for presenting uniform and standardized configuration data as well as for storing and managing Blockchain. On the other, Blockchain shall ensure authenticity and integrity of the configuration data.

AB This paper describes how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) can be used to enforce social contracts and to orchestrate the behavior of agents trying to access a shared resource. The first part of this paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of using DLTs architectures to implement certain control systems in an Internet of Things (IoT) setting and then focuses on a specific type of DLT based on a directed acyclic graph. In this setting, we propose a set of delay differential equations to describe the dynamical behavior of the Tangle, an IoT-inspired directed acyclic graph designed for the cryptocurrency IOTA. The second part proposes an application of DLTs as a mechanism for dynamic deposit pricing, wherein the deposit of digital currency is used to orchestrate access to a network of shared resources. The pricing signal is used as a mechanism to enforce the desired level of compliance according to a predetermined set of rules. After presenting an illustrative example, we analyze the control system and provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the network.

AB Blockchain is widely deemed as a key enabling technology of current digital currency. However, the application of blockchain to wireless mobile networks is challenged by a computational difficult problem called proof-of-work puzzle. Accordingly, mobile edge computing (MEC) appears to be a promising solution by offloading the computation-intensive mining tasks to nearby edge computing nodes. Meanwhile, caching is also popular due to its capability in handling the ever-increasing Internet traffic. In this paper, we study computation offloading and content caching in wireless blockchain networks with MEC. Specifically, offloading mode selection (offloaded to a nearby access point (AP) or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users) and caching strategy (whether to cache the requested content and computation results or not) are jointly investigated and formulated as an optimization problem. Further, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem in a distributed way. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results with different system parameters.

AB In 2017, the Blockchain-based cryptocurrency market witnessed enormous growth. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached all-time highs many times over the year leading to speculations to explain the trend in its growth. In this paper, we study Bitcoin and explore features in its network that explain its price hikes. We gather data and analyze user and network activity that highly impact Bitcoin price. We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that determine the demand and supply dynamics of a cryptocurrency. Finally, we use machine learning methods to construct models that predict Bitcoin price. Our regression model predicts Bitcoin price with 99.4% accuracy and 0.0113 root mean squared error (RMSE).

AB The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose Probe-IoT - a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. Probe-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and stores them securely as transactions in public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Probe-IoT presents a scheme that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public ledger. Furthermore, during the investigation of a malicious incident, Probe-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and verify the authenticity and integrity of the obtained evidence.

   OWNERSHIP; COSTS; FIRM
AB A healthy system of shareholder voting is crucial for any regime of corporate law. The proper allocation of governance power is subject to debate, of course, but the fitness of the underlying mechanism used to stuff the ballot boxes should concern everyone. Proponents of shareholder power, for instance, cannot argue for greater control if the legitimacy of the resulting tallies is suspect. And those who advocate for board deference do so on the bedrock of authority that reliable shareholder elections supposedly confer.
   Unfortunately, our trust in the corporate franchise was forged during an era that predates modern complexities in the way that stock ownership is now tracked and traded. We do not trace shares, and any clear-eyed look at the conferral of voting rights via back-end stock clearing practices is unsettling. Evidence of the various entanglements crops up from time to time-in the form of questionable voting outcomes or disputes about standing for shareholder lawsuits-but the underlying problems are systemic, not episodic. Our stock clearing system is a kludge.
   This is an important moment for corporate law, however, because new technology is approaching a state where clearing and settlement systems may soon support traceable shares. The rise of distributed ledgers and blockchain technology is poised to allow for specific share identification and precise records of share provenance. This may sound like an uninteresting technical sideshow, but as this Article will argue, the impact of traceable shares on corporate law will be profound. It will change the structure of shareholder lawsuits, alter the allocation of corporate governance rights, and require lawmakers to rethink fundamental principles of shareholder responsibility for corporate misdeeds.

AB Digitalization of the energy grid, leading to a so-called smart grid, offers notable benefits to the electricity system itself, and creates economic, social, and environmental value for different parties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding the value proposition underlying a technically feasible smart grid initiative. In this paper we identify requirements towards an approach for understanding the value proposition of a smart grid initiative, and propose a first step towards such an approach in the form of a landscape of modeling languages complemented by a process model for valuation. We evaluate the proposed approach, among others, by applying it to a blockchain-based initiative in the energy sector.

AB In blockchain-based systems, malicious behaviour can be detected using auditable information in transactions managed by distributed ledgers. Besides cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has recently been used for other applications, such as file storage. However, most of existing blockchain-based file storage systems can not revoke a user efficiently when multiple users have access to the same file that is encrypted. Actually, they need to update file encryption keys and distribute new keys to remaining users, which significantly increases computation and bandwidth overheads. In this work, we propose a blockchain and proxy re-encryption based design for encrypted file sharing that brings a distributed access control and data management. By combining blockchain with proxy re-encryption, our approach not only ensures confidentiality and integrity of files, but also provides a scalable key management mechanism for file sharing among multiple users. Moreover, by storing encrypted files and related keys in a distributed way, our method can resist collusion attacks between revoked users and distributed proxies.

AB Blockchain is one of the technology innovations for sharing data across organizations through a peer to peer overlay network. Many blockchain-based data sharing applications, such as sharing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) among different Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs), require privacy preserving verification services with dual capabilities. On one hand, the users want to verify the authenticity of EHR data as well as the identity of the signer. On the other hand, the signer wants to keep his real identity private such that others cannot trace and infer his identity information. However, typical blockchain systems that use pseudonyms as public keys, such as Bitcoin's blockchain, cannot support such privacy-preserving verification. In such systems, it is hard to verify the authenticity of signer's identity, and adversaries or curious parties can guess the real identity from the series of statements and actions taken with a specific pseudonym through inference attacks, such as by transaction graph analysis. In this paper, we propose a decentralized attribute-based signature scheme for healthcare blockchain, which provides efficient privacy-preserving verification of authenticity of EHR data and signer's identity. We also describe a holistic on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage system for efficient storage and verification EHR data. The analysis and experiments show that our scheme is effective and deployable.

AB Although cryptocurrencies have witnessed explosive growth in the past year, they have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of payment routing in PCN. We suggest crucial design goals in PCN routing, and propose a novel distributed dynamic routing mechanism called CoinExpress. Through extensive simulations, we have shown that our proposed mechanism is able to achieve outstanding payment acceptance ratio with low routing overhead.

AB Security has become a part of our everyday life due to the breakthrough technologies of wireless communication, e-commerce and digital content delivery. For ensuring authenticity of the transactions, cryptographic hash algorithms, such as SHA1/2/3 are standardised in different protocols. In this paper, we undertake a detailed instruction-set customization study for accelerating SHA algorithms on a commercially available customisable processor, Tensilica Xtensa core. We have explored the bottlenecks of implementations on Tensilica Xtensa and designed efficient custom instructions, resulting in 30% improvement in performance compared to implementations using generic instructions. Furthermore, we highlight the usage of SHA-256 as a widely used cryptographic hash function for blockchain and cryptocurrency mining.

DE Smart contract; Anti-patterns; Detection; Optimization
AB Being a new kind of software leveraging blockchain to execute real contracts, smart contracts are in great demand due to many advantages. Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform that supports smart contracts by running them in its virtual machine. To ensure that a smart contract will terminate eventually and prevent abuse of resources, Ethereum charges the developers for deploying smart contracts and the users for executing smart contracts. Although our previous work shows that under-optimized smart contracts may cost more money than necessary, it just lists 7 anti-patterns and the detection method for 3 of them. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth investigation on such under-optimized smart contracts. We first identify 24 anti-patterns from the execution traces of real smart contracts. Then, we design and develop GasReducer, the first tool to automatically detect all these anti-patterns from the bytecode of smart contracts and replace them with efficient code through bytecode-to-bytecode optimization. Using GasReducer to analyze all smart contracts and their execution traces, we detect 9,490,768 and 557,565,754 anti-pattern instances in deploying and invoking smart contracts, respectively.

ID BROADCAST ENCRYPTION
AB Usually, medical information including physical examination results and treatment of patients is stored in the hospital's centralized database. Although sophisticated access control strategy is adopted, it is still high-risk to expose patients' privacy in complex network environment. Moreover, a practical service platform is missed to share this kind of information under patients' authentication. To solve these problem, we elaborate an efficient and secure medical information service platform based on distributed cloud and blockchain technology, simultaneously guarantee security and confidentiality by hierarchical identity-based broadcast encryption system. Within our proposed framework, medical data are stored on distributed cloud after encryption. An incentive mechanism is designed to encourage customers and miners to maintain the platform. It shows that our platform is safe and effective in practice.

AB Big data technology has brought innovation and convenience to many areas, such as medical diagnosis, financial investment and smart travel. However, one of the most urgent challenges is how to collect massive private data from end customers effectively without invasion of privacy. In this paper, a framework, called Trusted Big Data Collection and Trade (TBDCT) system, is proposed to provide a fair and trusted platform for every participant in big data world. Firstly, by adopting technology of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), data is binded with the 'fingerprint' of the sensor to identify the authenticity of source. Secondly, private network attached storage embedded with Trusted Security Module (TSM) is used to guarantee the trustability of collecting process. Lastly, blockchain is implemented in this system to provide decentralized accounting and trading platform. With this framework, private data can be traded and the conflict between private data shortage and invasion of privacy can be mitigated. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed TBDCT.

AB Nowadays, the cloud hosts the majority of IoT virtualizations. This approach depends on an active Internet connection. The question that emerges is how we can move those virtualizations to the edge of IoT networks without losing the power and flexibility from the cloud but fulfilling the requirements of constrained and pervasive environments. This research presents an architecture that integrates dew computing to provision virtual resources at the edge level. This architecture proposes smart virtual resources deployed towards edge devices to provide data views and IoT services to users. This approach goes beyond traditional IoT virtualizations and builds distributed virtual systems that include the benefits of the cloud, fog, and dew computing to provide services directly at the edge level.

AB The rise of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has increased the popularity of blockchain technology, the framework these cryptocurrencies are built upon. The security and access control that blockchain technology has provided for cryptocurrencies has peaked the curiosity of other industries, realizing its potential value and future outlook. In this paper, we analyze two types of blockchains, permission-ed and permission-less, and introduce a two-tier blockchain concept utilizing both types for secure data sharing. We provide background on the consensus algorithms used for each blockchain type, Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Authority. Testing on both Mac OS and Ubuntu Linux-based system environments, preliminary results show that by increasing the number of miners in a Proof-of-Work consensus, there is a correlating increase in the total block count in a permissionless blockchain, where the rate of increase is dependent on the system environment. In the Proof-of-Authority permission-ed blockchain, the block count observed little to no change across both environments.

AB In distributed high-performance systems that allow processing large data sets, the important task is the analysis and verification of the video data. The problem of confirming data is relevant for many areas. The need for this arises when fixing offences, banking, remote management, confirmation of actions, etc. In this paper, we describe an approach to verifying video received by a mobile device like mobile phone, tablet or PC, equipped with a camera and controlled by the operating system (Windows, Android or iOS). The proposed algorithm uses the procedure of entering the Swype code using the movement mobile camera. To improving the accuracy, we use additional information from different mobile sensors like accelerometer, gyro, barometer, and GPS. In the process of data verification, video transmission to the server is not perform what ensures the privacy of the captured video data. The server and mobile device stores data about the file size, the date of its recording, the time, the data device and its position.

   Ownership transfer
AB Traceability of ICs is important for verifying provenance. We present a novel IC traceability scheme based on blockchain. A blockchain is an immutable public record that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. In the proposed scheme, 1C ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, we also need to establish correspondence between a record in a public database and the physical device, in an unclonable way. We propose an embedded physically unclonable function (PUF) to establish this correspondence The blockchain ensures the legitimacy of an IC's current owner, while the PUF safeguards against IC counterfeiting and tampering. Our proposed solution combines hardware and software protocols to let supply chain participants authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips during their entire life cycle.

TI Postmoney theory: value function in the domain of postmoney

   Postmoney theory
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to research the latest quantitative and qualitative transformations of money and its interaction with the market economy and societies in terms of their influence on the inner nature of money and its transformation from a simple tool to an aim per se, i.e. postmoney. Transforming the perception of the intrinsic value and soul of the money into the postmoney, influenced by the rising longevity and wide expectation for the ability to scientifically prolong the human life, will be discussed. This transformation will be confirmed by analysing the results from a national representative sociological survey (panel study with sample size n = 1,000).
   Design/methodology/approach The author uses the following philosophical methodological approaches - comparative-constructive, phenomenological, cognitive and deconstructive analysis.
   Findings The objective and qualitative reasons offered by the postmoney theory (PMT) for the transformation of money into postmoney, are related to the being of temporality, as well as to technologization and the sixth factor of production, scientific exponentiality and mental changes in the human being. A current postmoney survey gives a strong base to believe that the perception of an intrinsic value of postmoney changes the shape of a value function - from logarithmic to linear or even stochastic. This is the reason to believe that increasing of a postmoney quantity will lead to a qualitative transformation and psychological increase of postmoney sensitivity.
   Research limitations/implications The author intends to expand the postmoney survey on the international level so to confirm local findings.
   Practical implications Postmoney survey might be used as a powerful tool in creating and legalizing non-monistic money based on blockchain technologies and philosophical and socio-economic research of the postmoney issue.
   Social implications The future of money is of great importance for the exponentiality of the socio-economic environment and societies. Social impact of the money will be inevitably rising in the domain of postmoney perception.
   Originality/value The author of the current paper coined for the first-time notion of postmoney and now is expanding research developing PMT. As per the best knowledge of the author, shape of the curve of value function was not questioned and believes it might be of help to better understand the money phenomenon.

AB In this paper, we present a novel method, process, and system for calculating dyslexic symptoms, generating metric data for an individual user, community, or group in general. We present a mobile multimedia Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment that can capture multimodal smartphone or tab-based user interaction data during dyslexia testing and share it via a mobile edge network, which employs auto-grading algorithms to find dyslexia symptoms. In addition to algorithm-based auto-grading, the captured mobile multimedia payload is stored in a decentralized repository that can be shared with a medical practitioner for replay and further manual analysis purposes. Since the framework is language-independent and based on Blockchain and a decentralized big data repository, dyslexic patterns and a massive amount of captured multimedia IoT test data can be shared for further clinical research, statistical analysis, and quality assurance. Notwithstanding, our proposed Blockchain and off-chain-based decentralized and secure dyslexia data storage, management, and sharing framework will allow security, anonymity, and multimodal visualization of the captured test data for mobile users. This paper presents the detailed design, implementation, and test results, which demonstrate the strong potential for wider adoption of the dyslexia mobile health management globally.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB The Blockchain technology can be defined as a distributed ledger database for recording transactions between parties verifiably and permanently. Blockchain emerged as a leading technology layer for financial applications. Nevertheless, in the past years, the attention of researchers and practitioners moved to the application of the Blockchain technologies to other domains. Recently, it represents the backbone of a new digital supply chain. Thanks to its capability of ensuring data immutability and public accessibility of data streams, Blockchain can increase the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of the overall supply chain, and optimize the inbound processes. The literature concerning Blockchain in non-financial applications mainly focused on the technological part and the Business Process Modeling, lacking in terms of standard methodology for designing a strategy to develop and validate the overall Blockchain solution and integrate it in the Business Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to overcome this lack. First, we integrate the current literature filling the lack concerning the digital strategy, creating a standard methodology to design Blockchain technology use cases, which are not related to finance applications. Second, we present the results of a use case in the fresh food delivery, showing the critical aspects of implementing a Blockchain solution. Moreover, the paper discusses how the Blockchain will help in reducing the logistics costs and in optimizing the operations and the research challenges.

DE Blockchain; account structure; usage behavior
AB As a promising technology, blockchain overcomes many shortages in traditional areas. However, the low efficiency prevents it from being widely used in practice. Through analyzing the transaction history in blockchain, we found that the account usage frequency is highly heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a new account structure to improve the efficiency. The preliminary experiments show that the proposed structure has obvious advantages in efficiency compared with other account structures.

TI Towards Secure Network Computing Services for Lightweight Clients Using

ID ARCHITECTURE; MODEL
AB The emerging network computing technologies have significantly extended the abilities of the resource-constrained loT devices through the network-based service sharing techniques. However, such a flexible and scalable service provisioning paradigm brings increased security risks to terminals due to the untrustworthy exogenous service codes loading from the open network. Many existing security approaches are unsuitable for IoT environments due to the high difficulty of maintenance or the dependencies upon extra resources like specific hardware. Fortunately, the rise of blockchain technology has facilitated the development of service sharing methods and, at the same time, it appears a viable solution to numerous security problems. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based secure service provisioning mechanism for protecting lightweight clients from insecure services in network computing scenarios. We introduce the blockchain to maintain all the validity states of the off-chain services and edge service providers for the IoT terminals to help them get rid of untrusted or discarded services through provider identification and service verification. In addition, we take advantage of smart contracts which can be triggered by the lightweight clients to help them check the validities of service providers and service codes according to the on-chain transactions, thereby reducing the direct overhead on the IoT devices. Moreover, the adoptions of the consortium blockchain and the proof of authority consensus mechanism also help to achieve a high throughput. The theoretical security analysis and evaluation results show that our approach helps the lightweight clients get rid of untrusted edge service providers and insecure services effectively with acceptable latency and affordable costs.

DE Auditing; Blockchain; ISO/IEC 15408-2
AB In this study, we utilize a blockchain network as the underlying communication architecture to construct an ISO/IEC 15408-2 compliant security auditing system. The proposed system is an evolutionary paradigm not only seamlessly integrating the advantages, i.e. de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, of the blockchain network, but fulfilling the critical auditing requirements identified by ISO/IEC 15408-2. Versatile intelligent applications, including IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) robots, are highly suitable to adopt our security auditing system.

   algorithm; campaign analysis
AB In order for malicious software to receive configuration information or commands, malware needs to be able to locate and connect to its owner. As hard-coded addresses are easy to block and thus render the malware installation inoperable, malware writers have turned to dynamically generated addresses. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) generate a list of candidate domain names, each valid for only a short time, at which the malware installation searches for its command & control (C&C) server. As DGAs generate a large list of potential domains - out of which one or a few is actually in use -, they leave a characteristic trace of many failed DNS lookups (NXDomain) in the network, and in result most DGAs can be efficiently detected.
   In this paper we describe an entirely new principle of domain generation, actively deployed in the Cerber ransomware, which finds and coordinates with its owner based on transaction information in the bitcoin blockchain. This allows the malware author to dynamically update the location of the server in realtime, and as the malware directly goes to the right location no longer generates a sequence of NXDomain responses. We describe the concept of coordination via the blockchain, and report results on a year-long observation of the assets used in the Cerber campaign.

ID AGREEMENT
AB This paper describes a novel Byzantine fault tolerant protocol that allows replicas to join and exit dynamically. With the astonishing success of cryptocurrencies, people attach great importance in "blockchain" and robust Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for consensus. Among the conventional wisdom, the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), proposed by Miguel and Liskov in 1999, occupies an important position.
   Although PBFT has many advantages, it has fatal disadvantages. Firstly, it works in a completely enclosed environment, where users who want to add or take out any node must stop the whole system. Secondly, although PBFT guarantees liveness and safety if at most [n-1/3] out of a total n replicas are faulty, it takes no measure to deal with these ineffective or malicious replicas, which is harmful to the system and will cause system crash finally. These drawbacks are unbearable in practice. In order to solve them, we present an alternative, Dynamic PBFT.

AB This paper introduces the concept of cross-generational system, which indicates an information technology system designed to allow different generations interacting through centuries or, even, millennia. In the era of digital immortality and advances in artificial intelligence, there will be not only the problem of preserving and accessing data, but the emergence of digital clones will bring new challenges for technology development, interaction design and ethics. This paper provides an overview of societal transformation towards digital immortality, then describes the vision of cross-generational system design, investigates the relative future challenges and proposes the eventual socio-ethical questions.

Legal mechanisms play an important role for successful implementation of the opportunities which form the basis of this technology. It also requires addressing the unjustified legal obstacles for applicability of the technology and, at the same time, deciding which includes the technology into established legal mechanisms. Authors analyze the main issues which may arise when including the results of intellectual activity into accounting systems based on Blockchain technologies.

AB With the Internet of Things (IoT), Things are expected to live in different "domains" and "contexts" during their lifetime. Information generated by and associated with Things should be manageable by multiple, diverse stakeholders accordingly. Moreover, the scope of the information related to Things can range from private and confidential to public and auditable. Identification, security, and interoperability in this vivid environment are expected to be challenging. In this paper we discuss how smart contracts and blockchain technologies create the potential for a viable solution. To this end, we present smart contract-based solutions that improve security and information management, we identify new opportunities and challenges, and we provide security recommendations and guidelines.

DE blockchain; consensus mechanism; iterated hash functions
AB Blockchain as a new technology has created a great amount of hype and hope for different applications. There is a promise of a better, decentralised trust based on strict guarantees from cryptography. However, there is a great similarity in the structure of blockchains and classical iterated hash functions of the Merkle-Damgard (M-D) type. As the structure of M-D type hash functions has been extensively studied and many different structural weaknesses have been exposed, it is plausible to think that blockchains also share these structural problems. In this paper, we present the most relevant problems of M-D type hash functions and their relation to blockchains. We also examine how these might affect currently established blockchains. Our results can help in avoiding some problems in the design of new blockchain systems and also provide some (theoretical) limits on the trustworthiness of current blockchains.

AB In the future, ecosystems for managing travel and all the associated services will be more diverse and innovative. These Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystems will combine services in an unforeseen way to enable fluent travel experiences. However, to succeed, MaaS ecosystems require integrators and enablers. Blockchains can serve as an technology enabler, but to reach their best potential blockchains need to tackle new business needs. MaaS ecosystems form an excellent arena for this. We present a model of a MaaS ecosystem, enabling easy, quick and trusted transactions taking advantage of artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled smart contracts. We also present a subset demonstration of this model, TravelToken, which utilizes QR code that stores and uses travel information in smart contract over Ethereum. The benefits are that all travel data can be stored in one ticket, information stays unaltered in blockchain, and value-share as well as compensations in case of delays will be automatic.

AB Blockchain is a new technology for data sharing between untrusted peers. However, it does not work well with massive transactions. Besides, there are high barriers between heterogeneous blockchain systems. In this paper, we proposed an innovative component-based framework for exchanging information across arbitrary blockchain system called interactive multiple blockchain architecture. In our architecture, a dynamic network of multi-chain is created for inter-blockchain communication. We propose the inter-blockchain connection model for routing management and messages transferring. Additionally, our proposed protocols provide transactions with atomicity and consistency in crossing-chain scene. In the end, our experiment results based on a network of private multiple blockchain systems show that the throughput is increased by a number of chains parallel running.

DE Location-Based Services; Blockchain; Proof of Location
AB Location-Based Services (LBSs) build upon geographic information to provide users with location-dependent functionalities. In such a context, it is particularly important that geographic locations claimed by users are trustworthy. Centralized verification approaches proposed in the last few years are not satisfactory, as they entail a high risk to the privacy of users. In this paper, we present and evaluate a novel decentralized, infrastructure-independent proof-of location scheme based on blockchain technology. Our scheme guarantees both location trustworthiness and user privacy preservation.

Furthermore, this SLL runs on top of a permissioned BC with significant redundancy, and can bc efficiently processed at high speed with scalability. In other words, when the workload increases, the SLL will be split and allocated to different processors to speed up the operation. The framework has been implemented and evaluated at a clearinghouse and processed 3.3B historical and real-time transactions.

AB Under the background of rapid development of distributed renewable energy (DRE) and demand response (DR), the traditional DR will develop into integrated demand response (IDR). The current centralized trading of electricity market model is unable to meet the trading needs of scattered IDR resources. As the decentralized and distributed accounting mode, the blockchain technology fits the requirement of IDR resources to participate in energy market. The blockchain-based DRE transaction platform can support the credible transaction and settlement between the IDR resources, and promote the development of DER. Corresponding to the transaction principle, the frame of blockchain-based IDR resources transaction scheme was proposed. The transactions between DER and DR are taken for example to explain the detail trading process. Finally, the smart contracts of the transactions are designed and deployed on Ethereum private blockchain to prove the validity of the proposed transaction scheme.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the conditions under which blockchain technology can be adopted and the design criteria that are needed for exchanging shipping documentation in containerized shipping. To alleviate the impact of current documentation exchange mechanisms on supply chain efficiency in the maritime industry, this study aims at presenting guidelines for leveraging blockchain technology as a solution for exchanging documentation in the shipping industry. We conduct semi-structured interviews with representatives from business, IT, and public institutions. This qualitative data is analyzed through a theoretical framework comprising transaction cost economics, diffusion of innovation and design theory. Based on the theoretical model and stakeholder analysis, a set of eight design principles are proposed for the successful implementation of blockchain. These are (1) Immutability, (2) Decentralization, (3) Security, (4) Privacy, (5) Compatibility, (6) Scalability, (7) Inclusiveness and (8) Territoriality. Furthermore, the study investigates four potential approaches for the implementation phase affecting the likelihood of adoption by industry stakeholders. The exploratory approach and generic framework provides the groundwork and inspiration for further research in supply chain management and the emerging field of blockchain technology.
