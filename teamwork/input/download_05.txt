AB In this paper, we present the progress of blockchain technology from the advent of the original publication titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," written by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, until the current days. Historical background and a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology are given. We provide an up-to-date comparison of the most popular blockchain platforms with particular emphasis given to consensus protocols. Additionally, we introduce a BlockLib, an extensively growing online library on blockchain platforms collected from the various sources and designed to enable contributions from the blockchain community. Main directions of the current blockchain research, facing challenges as well as the main fields of applications, are summarized. We also layout the possible future lines in the blockchain technology development.

AB this paper we give an overview of the Blockchain. We explain quickly how it works thanks to the hash function and the distributed architecture. Then come the descriptions of the two most famous consensus algorithms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. We also present some security issues for each algorithm. This paper contains a little explanation of others consensus algorithms that are inspired of these two. Finally, a new consensus algorithm for private Blockchain is presented.

DE One-time address; Blockchain; Privacy; Efficiency
AB One-time addresses have been an effective way to protect privacy of users in blockchain. However, most of existing one-time address schemes either consume extra storage for keys or are not quite efficient. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a new kind of one-time address scheme in which a user only needs to keep a single key pair. The proposed one-time address scheme reduces the storage of the key pairs and provides privacy for users in blockchain. Analysis and experiment results show that our scheme is efficient and secure as well.

AB Focused on the problem of master node selection and communication overhead in the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm which applied to the consortium blockchain, this paper proposes an Egalitarian Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ePBFT) consensus algorithm based on the PBFT algorithm. First, the concept of the primary node is diluted, so that each node in the chain is equal and efficient. Secondly, the consensus process is optimized to improve the efficiency of the consensus, the communication overhead is reduced to half of the PBFT in the case of less view changes. The experimental results show that the ePBFT algorithm and the PBFT algorithm are compared in the same environment, and the throughput is improved when the communication overhead and delay are reduced.

However, its integration with IoT is limited by scalability and expensive computation. To this end, we propose a two-layer-consensus based BC architecture optimized for IoT requirements. Low resource devices attached to the server and with users and other nodes form Base-Layer. There is a high-scalable and fully decentralized blockchain performing basic functions maintaining in Base-Layer, myriad blocks are mined and submitted every round, but only one block selected by Top-Layer can be recorded. Top-Layer with another high-security blockchain is formed by special nodes running a Non-byzantine fault tolerance algorithm to determine the accounting rights in random. Analysis and evaluation show that consensus has better fault tolerance and increases scalability.

AB Decentralization is a key selling point of most public blockchain platforms. However, despite the widely acknowledged importance of this property, most researches on this topic lack quantification, and none of them performs a calculation on the degrees of decentralization they achieve in practice. In this paper, taking Bitcoin and Ethereum for instances, we propose an entropy method in information theory to quantify the decentralization for them. Using the information entropy, we calculate the discrete degrees of blocks mined and address balances to quantify the degrees of decentralization for Bitcoin and Ethereum systems, and the results of calculations indicate that Bitcoin's mining is more approximately 12% decentralized than Ethereum with full samples, and Bitcoin's wealth is more approximately 9.2% decentralized than Ethereum with 10,000 samples. Our method can be used to evaluate the degree of decentralization for any blockchain system.

ID OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY-CONTROL
AB Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already.
   These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1) Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2) Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.

AB Existing blockchain systems scale poorly because of their distributed consensus protocols. Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are limited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads (i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question.
   This work takes a principled approach to apply sharding to blockchain systems in order to improve their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however, due to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and blockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine consensus protocols, improving individual shards' throughput. Next, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that securely assigns nodes into shards. We rely on trusted hardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and shard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction protocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators are malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both on a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our consensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions at scale. More importantly, our sharded blockchain reaches a high throughput that can handle Visa-level workloads, and is the largest ever reported in a realistic environment.

DE Query processing; Data integrity; Blockchain
AB Blockchains have recently been under the spotlight due to the boom of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. There is an increasing demand for querying the data stored in a blockchain database. To ensure query integrity, the user can maintain the entire blockchain database and query the data locally. However, this approach is not economic, if not infeasible, because of the blockchain's huge data size and considerable maintenance costs. In this paper, we take the first step toward investigating the problem of verifiable query processing over blockchain databases. We propose a novel framework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of the user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To support verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based authenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary query attributes. Two newindexes are further developed to aggregate intra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification. We also propose an inverted prefix tree structure to accelerate the processing of a large number of subscription queries simultaneously. Security analysis and empirical study validate the robustness and practicality of the proposed techniques.

AB It has been a decade since the concept of blockchain was invented as the underlying core data structure of the permissionless or public Bitcoin cryptocurrency network. Since then, several cryptocurrencies, tokens and ICOs have emerged. After much speculation and hype, significant number of them have become problematic or worthless! The public blockchain system Ethereum emerged by generalizing the use of blockchains to manage any kind of asset, be it physical or purely digital, with the introduction of Smart Contracts. Over the years, numerous myths have developed with respect to the purported utility and the need for public blockchains. The adoption and further adaptation of blockchains and smart contracts for use in the permissioned or private environments is what I consider to be useful and of practical consequence. Hence, the technical aspects of only private blockchain systems will be the focus of my SIGMOD 2019 keynote. Along the way, I will bust many myths associated with public blockchains. I will also compare traditional database technologies with blockchain systems' features and identify desirable future research topics.

AB Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing paradigm to solve problems that need human intrinsic, such as image annotation. However, there are two limitations in existing crowdsourcing platforms, i.e., non-transparent incentive mechanism and isolated profiles of workers, which harms the interests of both requesters and workers. Meanwhile, Blockchain technology introduces a solution to build a transparent, immutable data model in the Byzantine environment. Moreover, Blockchain systems (e.g., Ethereum) can also support the Tuning-complete script called smart contracts. Thus, we are motivated to use the feature of transparent data model and smart contract in Blockchain to address the two limitations. Based on the proposed solutions, we have designed a Blockchain based framework which supports foundations of general crowdsourcing platforms. In addition, our framework also has following novel features: (1) it provides the transparent incentive mechanisms; (2) it supports a trusted worker's profile sharing in a cross-platform mode.

DE Permissionless Blockchain; Permissioned Blockchain; Distributed
   Consensus; Byzantine Faults
AB The uprise of Bitcoin and other peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies has opened many interesting and challenging problems in cryptography, distributed systems, and databases. The main underlying data structure is blockchain, a scalable fully replicated structure that is shared among all participants and guarantees a consistent view of all user transactions by all participants in the system. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we expound on some of the most recent proposals to design scalable and efficient blockchains in both permissionless and permissioned settings. The focus of the tutorial is on the distributed systems and database aspects of the recent innovations in blockchains.

DE regulatory compliance; internet of things; blockchain; trust
AB Regulatory compliance is an essential exercise in the modern societies confirming safety and prevention of harm to consumers. Despite many efforts from international and national quality control authorities, transparency and accountability in regulatory compliance remain a challenging technical-legal problem sitting atop a heavy reliance on trust. This paper presents a theoretical model of regulatory compliance aiming at improving accountability for systems and data audit and introduces a higher degree of transparency in management and quality control. It explores the technical aspects of two emerging technologies the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain, and using a common use-case in practice shows how to better align these technologies with legal concerns and trust in regulatory compliance.

AB Digital technologies are actively entering into social relations, including well-established state legal institutions. At present, digitalization has deeply penetrated into the field of legislative and law enforcement practice. The analysis of the main development directions of digital technologies and the areas of their "penetration" into jurisprudence using general scientific and special methods allowed the authors to identify the main directions and prospects for the implementation of the main digital concepts in legal practice. The authors of the paper take into account the interdisciplinary nature of the problems posed, which determined the bilateral nature of the study. The results of the study can be used in the field of conducting both general theoretical and informational research. They can also be applied as part of legal education programs.

AB In spring 2016, the Distributed Autonomous Organization (The DAO) was created on Ethereum. As with Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a P2P network, where distributed ledgers are implemented as daisy-chained blocks of data. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ethers are spent to execute pieces of code called smart contracts. Investors paid their Ethers for the DAO to operate and received the opportunity to vote on and become investors in venture projects proposed by Ethereum-based startups. Transactions and settlements between investors and startups are executed autonomously. The DAO experiment failed shortly after inception as an anonymous hacker stole over $50M USD worth of Ethers out of the $168M invested. The Ethereum community voted to return (or fork) the state of the network to one prior to the hack, returning Ethers back to investors and shuttering the DAO. However, this action arguably represented as a bailout-ironically, Bitcoin was conceived as a reaction against the 2008 bailout of US banks-and violated the ledger immutability and "code is law" ethos of the blockchain community.

AB Public blockchains in support of Smart Contracts (SC), like Ethereum enable everyone to represent scarce, valuable resources (like cryptocurrencies) as so-called tokens. Token issuing and management was the first blockchain use case. However, programming languages and runtime systems used in the current blockchains for their SCs lack a secure and straightforward way to implement and handle tokens. The unnecessary complexity in doing so can lead to erroneous implementation of tokens and applications built on top of these, including the loss or theft of tokens as it happened. The most known attack was "TheDAO" attack which led to the "loss" of tokens, valued at that time at approximately 60 M US Dollar.
   A better and secure token representation directly embedded into a SC runtime and SC programming language could prevent loss of tokens. Thus this paper presents an approach including parts of a programming language using it. The core of the model is to use opaque and substructural data types together with an on-chain soundness checker to generically represent tokens securely as values similar to integers and booleans. Opaque data types enforce that only a designated piece of code can create values of that type. The substructural data types allow values to express scarcity by preventing the duplication and elimination of values. The on-chain soundness checker ensures that the deployed code does not violate guarantees given by the type system, which includes opaque and substructural data types.

AB Decentralised ledgers are a prime application case for consensus protocols. Changing sets of validators have to agree on a set of transactions in an asynchronous network and in the presence of Byzantine behaviour. Major research efforts focus on creating consensus protocols under such conditions, with proof-of-stake (PoS) representing a promising candidate. PoS aims to reduce the waste of energy inherent to proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocols. However, a significant challenge is to get PoS protocols "right", i.e. ensure that they are secure w.r.t. safety and liveness. The "Correct-by-Construction" (CBC) Casper approach by the Ethereum project employs pen-and-paper proofs to ensure its security. CBC Casper is a framework to define consensus protocols and aims to prove safety without loss of abstractness. Each member of the CBC Casper family of protocols is defined by five parameters. CBC Casper models the protocol by a state of each validator and messages sent by validators. Each validator can transition its state using messages by other validators that include their current consensus value and a justification (i.e. their previous messages). We extend CBC Casper in three ways. First, we summarise the research of CBC Casper and extend the definitions of safety and liveness properties. To this end, we discuss an instance of CBC Casper called Casper The Friendly GHOST (TFG), a consensus protocol using a variant of the GHOST fork-choice rule. Second, we refine the properties of messages and states in CBC Casper and give a definition of blockchain safety for Casper TFG. Third, we formally verify the CBC Casper framework together with our refined message and state properties as well as our blockchain safety definition in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant.

AB Distributed ledgers have the potential to revolutionize the financial landscape by removing trusted third parties. At the heart of most distributed ledgers is their consensus protocol. The consensus protocol describes the way participants in a distributed network interact with each other to obtain and agree on a shared state. While classical Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) algorithms are designed to work in closed, size-limited networks only, modern distributed ledgers - and blockchains in particular - often focus on open, permissionless networks.
   In this paper, we present a novel blockchain consensus algorithm for open, permissionless networks, called Albatross, inspired by speculative BFT algorithms. We argue that the protocol is secure under regular PBFT security assumptions and has a theoretical performance close to the maximum for single-chain Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms. We conclude by describing our future work related to Albatross.

AB In decentralized blockchain systems such as Bitcoin, the miners are rewarded for generating new blocks and processing the transactions. In order to reduce the reward variance, the miners join mining pools where the miners aggregate their computational resources and divide the reward according to their contributions, measured by shares. The miner-based attacks such as Block Withholding (BWH) and Fork After Withholding (FAW) yield unfair reward advantages to the attackers at the expense of the other honest miners by having the attackers withhold blocks while still submitting the shares and pretending to contribute to the victim pool. This paper introduces Anti-Withholding Reward System (AWRS) to prevent FAW and BWH attacks. Implemented at the pool manager (reducing the adoption overhead and supporting backward-compatibility), AWRS deprives the incentive for FAW and BWH attacks by providing greater rewards to the block submissions. AWRS completely disincentivizes the FAW attack and reduces the optimal attacker's behavior to honest mining, making the withholding-based threats irrelevant for rational miners.

AB Botnets are responsible for many large scale attacks happening on the Internet. Their weak point, which is usually targeted to take down a botnet, is the command and control infrastructure: the foundation for the diffusion of the botmaster's instructions. Hence, botmasters employ stealthy communication methods to remain hidden and retain control of the botnet. Recent research has shown that blockchains can be leveraged for under the radar communication with bots, however these methods incur fees for transaction broadcasting. This paper discusses the use of a novel technology, Whisper, for command and control instruction dissemination. Whisper allows a botmaster to control bots at virtually zero cost, while providing a peer-to-peer communication infrastructure, as well as privacy and encryption as part of its dark communication strategy. It is therefore well suited for bidirectional botnet command and control operations, and creating a botnet that is very difficult to take down.

AB IoT devices are quickly becoming a critical source of information about the physical world considered in business processes. Blockchains are a promising platform for such processes if they involve multiple parties with no shared, commonly trusted IT infrastructure. Transacting with a blockchain, however, requires software whose footprint overwhelms many lightweight IoT devices.
   In this paper we introduce the concept of a blockchain proxy to which an IoT device can offload a large part of this software footprint. The proxy only requires a slim proxy SDK on the device that holds a regular blockchain identity with its own private key, retaining full control of the transactions in the device. We discuss security implications and present cold-chain monitoring as a use case. Preliminary results show significant savings in CPU time and communication bandwidth for the IoT device.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrency replaces centralized institutions with a distributed network of Internet-based miners to generate currency and process financial transactions. Such blockchain systems reach consensus using proof of work (PoW), and the miners participating in PoW join mining pools to reduce the variance for more stable reward income. Prior literature in blockchain security/game theory identified practical attacks in block withholding attack (BWH) and the state of the art fork-after-withholding (FAW), which have the rational and uncooperative attacker compromise a victim pool and pose as a PoW contributor by submitting shares but withholding the blocks. We advance such threat strategy (creating greater reward advantage to the attackers at the expense of the other miners in the victim pool) and introduce the uncle-block attack (UBA) which exploits uncle blocks for block withholding. We analyze UBA's incentive compatibility and identify and model the critical systems- and environmental- parameters which determine the attack's impacts. Our analyses and simulations results show that a rational attacker is always incentivized to launch the UBA attack strategy (over FAW or protocol compliance) and that UBA is effective even in the unfavorable networking environment (in contrast, in such case, FAW is reduced to the suboptimal BWH attack and does not make use of the withheld block).

AB We conducted a longitudinal study to analyze the misuse of Bitcoin. We first investigated usage characteristics of Bitcoin by analyzing how many addresses each address transacts with (from January 2009 to May 2018). To obtain a quantitative estimate of the malicious activity that Bitcoin is associated with, we collected over 2.3 million candidate Bitcoin addresses, harvested from the dark web between June 2016 and December 2017. The Bitcoin addresses found on the dark web were labeled with tags that classified the activities associated with the onions that these addresses were collected from. The tags covered a wide range of activities, from suspicious to outright malicious or illegal. Of these addresses, only 47,697 have tags we consider indicative of suspicious or malicious activities.
   We saw a clear decline in the monthly number of Bitcoin addresses seen on the dark web in the periods coinciding with takedowns of known dark web markets. We also found interesting behavior that distinguishes the Bitcoin addresses collected from the dark web when compared to activity of a random address on the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, we found that Bitcoin addresses used on the dark web are more likely to be involved in mixing transactions. To identify mixing transactions, we developed a new heuristic that extends previously known ones. We found that Bitcoin addresses found on the dark web are significantly more active, they engage in transactions with 20 times the neighbors and 4 times the Bitcoin amounts when compared to random addresses. We also found that just 2,828 Bitcoin addresses are responsible for 99% of the Bitcoin value used on the dark web.

AB A new industrial revolution is undergoing, based on a number of technological paradigms. The will to foster and guide this phenomenon has been summarized in the expression "Industry 4.0" (I4.0). Initiatives under this term share the vision that many key technologies underlying Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics are converging to a new distributed, highly automated, and highly dynamic production network, and that this process needs regulatory and cultural advancements to effectively and timely develop. In this work, we focus on the technological aspect only, highlighting the unprecedented complexity of I4.0 emerging from the scientific literature. While previous works have focused on one or up to four related enablers, we consider ten technological enablers, including besides the most cited Big Data, Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing, also others more rarely considered as Fog and Mobile Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, down to the often overlooked, very recent, or taken for granted Open-Source Software, Blockchain, and the Internet. For each we explore the main characteristics in relation to I4.0 and its interdependencies with other enablers. Finally we provide a detailed analysis of challenges in leveraging each of the enablers in I4.0, evidencing possible roadblocks to be overcome and pointing at possible future directions of research. Our goal is to provide a reference for the experts in some of the technological fields involved, for a reconnaissance of integration and hybridization possibilities with other fields in the endeavor of I4.0, as well as for the laymen, for a high-level grasp of the variety (and often deep history) of the scientific research backing I4.0.

AB Blockchain is a technology making the shared registry concept from distributed systems a reality for a number of application domains, from the cryptocurrency one to potentially any industrial system requiring decentralized, robust, trusted, and automated decision making in a multi-stakeholder situation. Nevertheless, the actual advantages in using blockchain instead of any other traditional solution (such as centralized databases) are not completely understood to date, or at least there is a strong need for a vademecum guiding designers toward the right decision about when to adopt blockchain or not, which kind of blockchain better meets use-case requirements, and how to use it. In this paper, we aim at providing the community with such a vademecum, while giving a general presentation of blockchain that goes beyond its usage in Bitcoin and surveying a selection of the vast literature that emerged in the last few years. We draw the key requirements and their evolution when passing from permissionless to permissioned blockchains, presenting the differences between proposed and experimented consensus mechanisms, and describing existing blockchain platforms.

TI THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF BLOCKCHAIN-BASED, CROWDSOURCED ARBITRATION
SO MACQUARIE LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ADR
AB Online dispute resolution ('ODR') is in a state of rapid change and development. ODR platforms, such as British Columbia's Civil Resolution Tribunal, have been granted expanding mandates and the types of disputes that are being referred to these platforms has been increasing. To date, the existing platforms have been largely centralised; that is, either associated with the court system or organised by a centralised authority or administrator. More recently, however, many platforms have begun to emerge that promise to use blockchain technology to decentralise dispute resolution by crowdsourcing the adjudication of disputes to a worldwide pool of willing juror-arbitrators.
   This article seeks to survey the current landscape of these blockchain-based, crowdsourced arbitration platforms, in order to explain how each intends to operate, the similarities and differences amongst them and the conception of 'justice' that each one promotes. The goal of this overview is to achieve a better understanding of the promises of dispute resolution that each platform aims to produce. This kind of understanding is necessary to advance further discussion and consideration of the likely realities, including the normative limitations, of using these technologically-based solutions for the resolution of disputes.

AB Blockchain technology is getting a growing attention from various organizations and researchers as it provides magical solutions to the problems associated with the classical centralized architecture. Blockchain, whether public or private, is a distributed ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions by decentralizing the ledger among participating users. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Although the centralized IoT system provides countless benefits, it raises several challenges. Resolving these challenges can be done by integrating IoT with blockchain technology. To be prepared for the integration process, this chapter provides an overview of technical aspects of the blockchain and IoT. It started by reviewing blockchain technology and its main structure. Applications and challenges of the blockchain are also presented. This is followed by reviewing the IoT system by highlighting common architecture and essential characteristics. Various applications and challenges of the IoT system are also discussed.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth in a wide variety of use-cases in multiple application domains, such as healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, smart homes, supply chain, and so on. To harness its full potential, it must be based upon a resilient network architecture with strong support for security, privacy, and trust. Most of these issues still remain to be addressed carefully for the IoT systems. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a breakthrough technology with the potential to deliver some valuable properties such as resiliency, support for integrity, anonymity, decentralization, and autonomous control. A number of blockchain platforms are proposed that may be suitable for different use-cases including IoT applications. In such, the possibility to integrate the IoT and blockchain technology is seen as a potential solution to address some crucial issues. However, to achieve this, there must be a clear understanding of the requirements of different IoT applications and the suitability of a blockchain platform for a particular application satisfying its underlying requirements. This chapter aims to achieve this goal by describing an evaluation framework which can be utilized to select a suitable blockchain platform for a given IoT application.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially. It allows not only humans but also all various devices and objects in the environment to be connected over the Internet to share their data to create new applications and services which result in a more convenient and connected lifestyle. However, the current centralized IoT architecture faces several issues. For instance, all computing operations of all nodes in the network are carried out using a single server. This creates a single point of failure in which if the server goes down, the entire system will be unavailable. Also, the IoT centralized architecture is an easy target of various types of security and privacy attacks, since all IoT data collected from different devices is under the full authority of a single server. Therefore, adopting one of the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) for the IoT may be the right decision. One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It provides an immutable ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions by decentralizing the ledger among participating nodes in the blockchain network which eliminates the need for a central authority. Integrating the IoT system with the blockchain technology can provide several benefits which can resolve the issues associated with the IoT centralized architecture. Therefore, this chapter provides a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by providing an overview of the DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits and challenges. The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting its essential limitations. Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented by highlighting the integration benefits. Various application and challenges of integrating blockchain with IoT are also discussed.

AB With continuously changing operational and business needs of the organizations, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) is the current need of the organizations. Centralized Autonomous Organization (CAO) lack transparency and are managed by few efficient managers whereas Decentralized autonomous Organization's (DAO) is novel scalable, self-organizing coordination on the blockchain, controlled by smart contracts and its essential operations are automated agreeing to rules and principles assigned in code without human involvement. In this chapter we discuss the needs for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) and key efforts in this field. We then introduce a prospective solution employing blockchain Ethereum, which incorporates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract computing functionality. A solution is elaborated that permits the formation of organizations where participants preserve straight real-time check of contributed collects and governance policies are formalized, automatized and imposed using software. Basic code for smart contract is composed to make a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. We also explain the working of DAOs code, centering on fundamental establishment and governance characteristics, which includes organization, formation and voting rights. DAOs are considered to agree to the expectation of the business work in the future. But there is still lack of operational base for DAOs in the blockchain community.

DT Article; Book Chapter
AB The promise of blockchain extends into healthcare allowing a transformation of our current system and its use of information technology. The current use of information technology in healthcare can be advanced with blockchain. The fundamental values that blockchain will bring include decentralization due to its distributed ledger technology, interoperability and increased security and immutability. These benefits enable a healthcare system that is integrated, seamless and more secure and with an increased level of compliance. Blockchains offer the opportunity to deliver secure and highly efficient transaction processing between patient, provider and payer and other healthcare parties in a more efficient and seamless way. The use of smart contracts in healthcare is the catalyst by which blockchains can deliver these transactions in a transformative way. The application of blockchains combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) is also a catalyst that will enable these transactions to be processed to disrupt healthcare from its current state at this time. We explore ways that blockchain and its associated information technology will revolutionize our healthcare system that we believe would allow for a more efficient and fluid environment with improved cost efficiencies.

ID INTERNET
AB Due to the ever-increasing adaptation of Blockchain technologies in the private, public, and business domains, both the use of Distributed Systems and the increased demand for their reliability has exploded recently, especially with their desired integration with Internet-of-Things devices. This has resulted in a lot of work being done in the fields of distributed system analysis and design, specifically in the areas of blockchain smart contract design and formal verification. However, the focus on formal verification methodologies has meant that less attention has been given toward more traditional testing methodologies, such as unit testing and integration testing. This includes a lack of full support by most, if not all, the major blockchain implementations for testing at scale, except on fully public test networks. This has several drawbacks, such as: (1) The inability to do repeatable testing under identical scenarios, (2) reliance upon public mining of blocks, which introduces unreasonable amounts of delay for a test driven development scenario that a private network could reduce or eliminate, and (3) the inability to design scenarios where parts of the network go down. In this chapter we discuss design, testing methodologies, and tools to allow Testing at Scale of IoT Blockchain Applications.

AB Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around the blockchain, we examine whether they make a good fit to build a lightweight and robust access control framework to address security and privacy issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. In this direction, this chapter discusses the limitations of the centralized model to secure IoT and proposes the blockchain approach as example of successful distributed system to bring security and privacy to IoT devices. In this direction, we introduce FairAccess and PPDAC, as a lightweight and privacy-preserving access control framework based on the emergent blockchain technology, mainly the permissionless and public type, to ensure fine-grained access control functions for IoT devices with strong anonymity guarantee for IoT end-users. The proposed framework retains the benefits of the blockchain to meet IoT security and privacy arising needs while overcoming the challenges in integrating the blockchain to IoT.

AB The advancement of new technology has taken a huge leap in the last few decades. It is bringing a drastic change in each step of human life that are capable of performing intelligent tasks. The internet of things and blockchain are disruptive technologies that have received a huge attention from industry, academic and financial technologies. There is a risk of privacy leakage of sensitive information in the centralized IoT system because the centralized servers can access the plain text data from the IoT devices. There is an extensive interest in applying the blockchain in the IoT system to provide IoT data privacy and decentralized access model. However, the previous blockchain-based IoT systems have issues related to privacy leakage of sensitive information to the servers as the servers can access the plaintext data from the IoT devices. So, we present the potential of integration of blockchain based-IoT with homomorphic encryption that can secure the IoT data with high privacy in a decentralized mode. In addition, we provide comparison of the recent technologies toward the securing and preserving the privacy of the IoT data using blockchain and homomorphic encryption technology. We have also highlighted the research challenges and possible future research directions in the integrated blockchain-based IoT with homomorphic encryption.

AB Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set is the foundational model used in many blockchain systems to represent assets. The benefits of UTXO representation include parallel processing, privacy, etc. However, the increasing size of UTXO set is degrading the access performance and severely brings down the validation speed of blockchain further, especially in resource-constrained scenerios, such as IoT. In this paper, we present a memory-economical storage system for UTXO-based blockchain. Based on the inherent properties of UTXO set, we propose two lossless compression techniques to reduce the memory space occupied by UTXO set. Besides, the database related operations are adopted to make the proposed mechanism easily applied in current blockchain system. Taking Bitcoin as the object of study, our mechanism can deliver 2.9-4.5x memory reduction and orders of magnitude validation speed improvement in resource-constrained situations. This compact system will improve validation performance and extend applied scope of blockchains.

The study concludes that a smart contract is a program code based on blockchain technology, which, by legal characteristics, is a legally significant message recorded in a language (artificial language) and sealed with an electronic digital signature of each of the parties (or certified with a special key). It is proved that the multilateral interactions implemented through smart contracts can reduce the costs of operations and control them, increase the speed of operations and reduce the risks associated with dishonest actions of the parties, minimize or completely exclude intermediaries from the transaction; therefore, legislation should provide for the possibility of using smart contracts along with existing contracts.

AB The development of blockchain technology is very rapidly. As a decentralized distributed technology, the blockchain has become one of the most promising Internet applications, and its application in the power balance trading platform has also received extensive attention. In view of the information asymmetry between the trading center and the margin trading users in the power balance trading platform, it is difficult to guarantee the fairness of the transaction and affect the actual income of the production consumers. First, we analyze the trading mechanism of the power surplus market.Then we designed a smart contract for multi-party bidding power resources based on blockchain technology, and achieved the decentralized power trading decision to ensure the information is symmetric and fair.At the same time, the credibility model is established by analyzing the user's recent transaction records, and we design a corresponding punishment mechanism to strengthen the constraint on the execution of offline point-to-point power transactions.

DE Data sharing; Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Review
AB In the big data era, it is a significant need for data sharing in various industries. However, there are many weaknesses in the traditional centralized way of data sharing. It is easy to attack the centralized data storage center. As the process of data asset transactions is not transparent, there is a lack of trust in the percipients of data sharing. Blockchain technology offers a possibility to solve these problems in data sharing, as the blockchain can provide a decentralized, programmable, tamperproof, and anonymous data sharing environment. In this paper, we compare the blockchain-based data sharing with the traditional ways of data sharing, and analyze the scenarios in major industry applications. We survey the state of the art of the adoption of blockchain technologies in data sharing, and provide a summary about their technical frameworks and schemes.

AB This study aims to explore the values of blockchain based games from users' perspectives in China. To address this, we employed the Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) approach to derive the values of blockchain based games with users in China. Eleven active users of blockchain based games were interviewed in China. Based on the data collected from the interviews, we developed a means-ends objective network describing the values of blockchain based games from users' perspectives in China. According to the results, maximize enjoyment, maximize profit, maximize blockchain beliefs, and minimize risk of holding cryptocurrency were derived as the fundamental objectives to maximize values of blockchain based games from users' perspectives.

DE blockchain technology; cross-border e-commerce; product traceability
AB Blockchain technology provides us a new tool to solve the product traceability problem in supply chain. This in-progress paper focus on the cross-border e-commerce context, to develop blockchain-based information models for products and transactions. A general blockchain-based product information traceability framework is introduced. The framework is applied in cross-border e-commerce context. We also designed a multiple chain structure and the data management model following the framework. In the future works, we will develop the key distribution, anti-counterfeiting and other approaches following this framework, and also verify them with real data and simulation.

AB Given the ubiquity of digital technologies, and increased use of autonomous algorithms, it is likely that many of today's social and organizational processes will one day include autonomous elements. The Bitcoin blockchain is likely the first case of an increasingly generative and autonomous way of organizing, and the specific properties of blockchain infrastructures-distribution of control, openness to manipulation, and generativity of the underlying source code-make it an ideal case to study patterns of self-organizing. This paper investigates the phenomenon of self-organizing through a study of forking in the Bitcoin blockchain infrastructure between 2010 and 2016. It adds to the emerging body of research on digital infrastructures, and particularly blockchain infrastructures, by conceptualizing forking as a pattern of self-organizing in blockchain infrastructures that specifically involves the underlying infrastructure, the scale of code changes, individual objectives, and collective adoption, whether specific or general. Thus, this paper demonstrates how forking in blockchain infrastructures mediates between divergent organizing objectives and existing capabilities, on the one hand, and generates self-organizing on the other hand. In this paper, we further contextualize our findings in extant work on digital infrastructures, offer a guide for designers of blockchain infrastructures, and propose the concept of "generative mirroring" as a pattern through which blockchain infrastructures and organizing adaptively coevolve.

AB An ever growing variety of smart, connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices poses completely new challenges for businesses regarding security and privacy. In fact, the adoption of smart products may depend on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain technology could be a promising means to mitigate issues of data security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data. Following the explication of our SDPS, we provide an ex post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two additional use cases in the areas of pharmaceutical supply chains and energy microgrids. Our results suggest that the proposed design ensures the tamper-resistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor data in a privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient manner.

AB Blockchain technology, despite its origins as the underlying infrastructure for value transfer in the era of cryptocurrency, has been touted as the main disruptive force in modern businesses. Blockchain has the capacity to chronologically capture and store transactional data in a standardized and tamper-proof format that is transparent to all stakeholders involved in the transaction. This, in turn, has prompted companies to rethink preexisting business practices, thereby yielding a myriad of fascinating business models anchored in blockchain technology. In this study, we advance contemporary knowledge of business applications of blockchain by drawing on the theoretical lens of the digital business model and value configuration to decipher how pioneers in this space are leveraging blockchain to create and capture value. Through a comparative, multiple case study approach, we analyzed five companies in mainland China that have rolled out blockchain initiatives. From our case analyses, we derived a typology of five blockchain-inspired business models, each of which embodies a distinctive logic for market differentiation. For each business model, we offer insights into its value creation logic, its value capturing mechanism, and the challenges that could threaten its longer-term viability. Grounded in our findings, we discuss key implications for theory and practice.

AB The potential of blockchain has been extensively discussed in practitioner literature, yet rigorous empirical and theory-driven information systems (IS) research on blockchain remains scarce. This special issue addresses the need for innovative research that offers a fresh look at the opportunities and challenges of blockchain. This editorial integrates and goes beyond the papers included in this special issue by providing a framework for blockchain research in IS that emphasizes two important issues. First, we direct the attention of IS research toward the blockchain protocol level, which is characterized by recursive interactions between human agents and the blockchain protocol. Second, we highlight the need for IS research to consider how the protocol level constrains and affords blockchain applications, and how these constraints and other concerns at the application level lead to changes at the protocol level. Rooted in a sociomaterial view of IS, we offer a multi-paradigmatic IS research agenda that underscores the need for behavioral (individual, group, and organizational), design science, and IS economics research on blockchain. Our research agenda emphasizes issues of blockchain governance, human and material agency, blockchain affordances and constraints, as well as the consequences of its use.

TI IT-Based Financial Confirmation & Diagnosis Mechanisms
SO ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB The increasing complexity and dynamics of the financial domain impose appropriate tools to keep transactions efficient and secure. We propose to use a new technology, BlockChain (BC), and a revived technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), to build IT-based tools for financial confirmation and diagnosis. We describe first the mechanisms for both, confirmation and diagnosis. Then, the type of computation involved is analysed. The two technologies involved in our proposal, BC and AI, are computationally intensive. The time and energy involved cannot be minimized using off-the-shelf solutions. Finally, the architectural environment for an efficient implementation is proposed and evaluated. The paper represents the description of our proposed approach to solve critical problems affecting the current financial systems.

AB Distributed storage systems (DSS) have a potential of storing big amounts of data. Specialized DSS codes were defined with the main idea to enhance the reliability, availability, maintenance and data security in DSS systems. In this paper, we establish a new way of communication, named Distributed Communication Channel (DCC), that uses the coding mechanism that is similar to the one applied in the DSS. DCC represents a communication channel between two or more parties, that exchange information through multiple physical channels. It adapts the DSS concept using the benefits established with respect to the communication reliability and security against intruders and attacks. Moreover, with this concept we offer an increased security using the recent developments used in the Blockchain technology. The blockchain is used as a tool to securely bypass the transformation matrix or the exchange of encryption keys, between the sender and the receiver in the communication channel. The whole system uses the so-called spatial spreading mechanism to transfer the data through independent channels. Therefore, it is more reliable and secure, than the basic systems using the DSS algorithm.

AB In this paper key applications of blockchain (and smart contracts) are reviewed coming from across different industries around the world, and lessons learned are pulled from this review with a specific focus on what can be learned regarding the energy industry and in relation to the energy transition in particular. While it is difficult to obtain clear conclusions based on such early stage applications in other industrial sectors, like the financial sector, some basic insights emerged that could provide general lessons learned to inform players in the energy industry (in particular utilities and the innovation ecosystem around them) about the potential for blockchain in the energy industry, considering of course that stakeholders in this industry operate and innovate under a highly regulated market.

AB Global supply chains represent the backbone of the modern manufacturing industry. Planning of global supply chains still represents a major hurdle, mainly because of the high complexity and unforeseen disruptions that have to be mastered for meeting the different logistics windows in a globally distributed production environment. Trust in supply chains is an additional challenge. A major - albeit sometimes overlooked - part of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management and integration of customs processes, clearing of tariffs, (re-)billing of customers, and fulfilling other legal requirements related to crossing borders, ranging from environmental standards over goods inspection to general paper work. With the exception of work offered by the World Customs Organization (WCO) the issue of customs and blockchain is still underrepresented in research and practice. In this paper, we look at innovations that drive the current ICT-enabled SCM research and how these can be combined with smart customs management. After a literature review and introduction to the state-of-the-art, we list potential trust-based innovations for SCM and customs in digital business ecosystems. Based upon the innovations we also describe a requirements analysis of existing distributed ledger technologies (requirements for system layout, system configuration, system governance). A description of the prototype for the Lake Constance region - on which we are currently working - concludes the paper.

DE blockchain; construction industry
AB Due to the increasingly complex nature of large-scale structural engineering projects, there is an increasing focus on the adoption and integration of technology. However, the construction sector tends to be further behind than most when it comes to the adoption of process-based innovative technologies. On the other hand, the decentralised, peer-to-peer principles of blockchain technology has recently attracted interest from a range of industries around the globe who are attempting to improve their business practices. This paper provides insights into the performance capabilities of blockchain technology in the construction industry and the feasibility of its potential adoption through use cases. It explores smart contract applications and the feasibility of integrating the technology with building information modelling and information management. Furthermore, the paper argues that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of processes within the construction industry and eliminate issues surrounding trust, transparency and verification currently experienced in the sector.

DE ICO; blockchain; Value creation; Business Model; Business and
   Communication Plan
AB In 2013 a new fund-raising modality was born. It's called Initial Coin Offering (ICO), it's based on blockchain technology and requires a significant enterprise business model review. ICO is not only a new financing approach; through token issue, it permits to establish a wide range of direct relationships between interested counterparts as entrepreneurs, investors, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders; this set of relationships can generate several types of token-based communities depending on each ICO specific goals. ICO is under regulation in several countries and one of the first is Switzerland through government and FINMA ICO Guidelines, which supplies an institutional and legal framework. Given that ICO is recently born and there is a lack of well-defined standards and phenomenon comprehension, investors are not yet confident to operate in this market. In order to face this matter, a deep knowledge of operative mechanisms and a consolidation of standards for fully potential exploitation are needed. The goal of this Paper is to integrate in an innovative way enterprise Business Model, Business Plan and Communication Plan with the Token Plan in order to exploit the ICO critical success factors. As deliverable the Paper identifies some critical factors and furnishes a set of key recommendations, suggestions and guidelines for a successful ICO.

ID DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY
AB Since its deployment in 2009 the Blockchain technology has been getting a lot of attention in research, media as well as various industries. In the beginning, only financial related use cases were discussed and implemented, as the first real life and well-known implementation was Bitcoin. Since then many different types of Blockchains evolved. However, it is still unclear what the basic characteristics of a Blockchain are and how those interact to form different types of Blockchains. With this research, we therefore propose a taxonomy of the Blockchain technology to help form a better understanding of the technology itself and guide future research on how to differentiate the multiple types.

TI Hubs, Rebalancing and Service Providers in the Lightning Network

AB Payment channel networks are the most developed proposal to address the well-known issue of blockchain scalability. Currently, the Lightning Network (LN) is the mainstream and most used payment channel network. In a previous work we introduced CLoTH, a payment channel network simulator we developed to analyze capabilities and limitations of such networks. In this work, using CLoTH, we present results of three groups of simulations on a recent snapshot of the LN, aimed to shed a light on the following aspects. Firstly, we investigated how hubs influence the LN performance. Then, we analyzed the effectiveness of two different channel rebalancing approaches, an active and a passive one. Eventually, we studied performance of the LN when a few service-providers nodes receive payments from the other network nodes, which is a typical use case of payment channel networks. We found that the LN is resilient to the removal of hubs, that our passive rebalancing approach reduces of about one fourth the payments failures due to channel unbalancing, and that in the service-providers scenario a consistent part of payments fails because channels directing to the service providers become unbalanced. Our work contributes to prove the strengthen of the Lightning Network when removing hubs and its weakness in the service-provider scenario. In addition, the passive rebalancing approach proposed in this work is a good candidate for the implementation in the Lightning Network protocol to mitigate channel unbalancing.

DT Article
DE Blockchain; blockchain-as-a-service; cloud computing; smart contracts
AB Blockchain, originated from Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention from the academic community because of its decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system

ID CONSENSUS
AB Blockchains guarantee data integrity through consensus of distributed ledgers based on multiple validation nodes called miners. For this reason, any blockchain system can be critically disabled by a malicious attack from a majority of the nodes (e.g., 51% attack). These attacks are more likely to succeed as the number of nodes required for consensus is smaller. Recently, as blockchains are becoming too large (making them difficult to store, send, receive, and manage), sharding is being considered as a technology to help improve the transaction throughput and scalability of blockchains. Sharding distributes block validators to disjoint sets to process transactions in parallel. Therefore, the number of validators of each shard group is smaller, which makes shard-based blockchains more vulnerable to 51% attacks than blockchains that do not use sharding. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a trust-based shard distribution (TBSD) scheme that assigns potential malicious nodes in the network to different shards, preventing malicious nodes from gaining a dominating influence on the consensus of a single shard. TBSD uses a trust-based shard distribution scheme to prevent malicious miners from gathering in on one shard by integration of a trust management system and genetic algorithm (GA). First, the trust of all nodes is computed based on the previous consensus result. Then, a GA is used to compute the shard distribution set to prevent collusion of malicious miners. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed TBSD scheme results in a shard distribution with a higher level of fairness than existing schemes, which provides an improved level of protection against malicious attacks.

AB A blockchain as a trustworthy and secure decentralized and distributed network has been emerged for many applications such as in banking, finance, insurance, healthcare and business. Recently, many communities in blockchain networks want to deploy machine learning models to get meaningful knowledge from geographically distributed large-scale data owned by each participant. To run a learning model without data centralization, distributed machine learning (DML) for blockchain networks has been studied. While several works have been proposed, privacy and security have not been sufficiently addressed, and as we show later, there are vulnerabilities in the architecture and limitations in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving DML model for a permissioned blockchain to resolve the privacy, security, and performance issues in a systematic way. We develop a differentially private stochastic gradient descent method and an error-based aggregation rule as core primitives. Our model can treat any type of differentially private learning algorithm where non-deterministic functions should be defined. The proposed error-based aggregation rule is effective to prevent attacks by an adversarial node that tries to deteriorate the accuracy of DML models. Our experiment results show that our proposed model provides stronger resilience against adversarial attacks than other aggregation rules under a differentially private scenario. Finally, we show that our proposed model has high usability because it has low computational complexity and low transaction latency.

ID PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS; ENCRYPTION; POLICY
AB The sharing of electronic health records (EHRs) has great positive significance for research of disease and doctors' diagnosis. In recent years, cloud-based electronic medical record sharing scheme has brought a lot of conveniences, but the centralization of cloud exposes threats inevitably to data security and privacy preservation. Blockchain technology can be seen as a promising solution to address these problems on account of its unique propertis of decentration, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure and privacy-preserving EHR sharing protocol. Data requester can search desired keyword from data provider to find relevant EHRs on the EHR consortium blockchain and get the re-encryption ciphertext from cloud server after getting the data owner's authorization. The scheme mainly uses searchable encryption and conditional proxy re-encryption to realize data security, privacy preservation, and access control. Furthermore, proof of authorization is designed as the consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain to guarantee system's availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve security goals. Besides, we emulate the cryptographic primitives and implement the proposed scheme on Ethereum platform. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has high computational efficiency.

DE Decentralized knowledge graph; deep recommender system; crowdsourcing;
   blockchain; smart contracts
AB Since first coined by Google in 2012, knowledge graph has received extensive attention from both industry and academia, and has been widely used in many scenarios with success, e.g. information retrieval, online recommendation, question-answering, and so on. However, traditional centralized construction of knowledge graph faces many challenges, such as laborious and time-consuming, vulnerable to manipulation or tampering, lacking scrutiny, among others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel decentralized knowledge graph construction method by means of crowdsourcing, and the business logic of crowdsourcing is implemented by blockchain-powered smart contracts to guarantee the transparency, integrity, and auditability. On this basis, the decentralized knowledge graph is used for a deep recommender system, and case studies validate the effectiveness of the system. This paper is aimed at providing a novel decentralized approach for constructing knowledge graph and serving as reference and guidance for future research and practical applications of knowledge graph.

AB The proliferation of electric vehicles and active distribution network has brought many uncertainties to the power system. If the power system involves battery-swap stations of electric vehicles, it is difficult to ensure the data security during the distributed scheduling. To solve the problem, this paper sets up a collaborative optimization model for distributed scheduling based on blockchain consensus mechanism, considering the battery-swap stations. The power system was divided into three levels: the transmission network level, the distribution network level and the battery-swap station level. Next, the objective functions were constructed to minimize the generation cost and daily load variance on each level, and the optimal scheduling plan for the power system was solved through multi-level collaborative optimization. The blockchain consensus mechanism was adopted to verify the accuracy of the transaction data, and the production data of all entities were encoded by hash function before storage, such that the data are tamper resistant and traceable. The example analysis shows that our model can effectively reduce the generation cost, lower the daily load variance, and enhance system stability. The research findings shed new light on maintaining the optimization efficiency and data confidentiality of modern power network.

AB This paper attempts to solve the security problems in communication, consensus-making and authentication of nodes in the Internet of vehicles (IoV) for intelligent transport. Considering the defects of the central node and service complexity in the IoV, the blockchain was integrated with the IoV to create a decentralized mechanism for communication and consensus-making. In the architecture of the blockchain-based IoV, the Byzantine consensus algorithm based on time sequence and gossip protocol is used to complete information communication and consensus authentication, which not only ensures communication security, improves the consensus efficiency of nodes, but also improves the fault tolerance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm outshined the traditional authentication method in information security and consensus efficiency of the IoV. The research findings provide a reference solution to the authentication problems in the IoV for intelligent transport.

AB In traditional cloud computing system, searchable encryption is deemed as a core technology to realize data confidentiality protection and information retrieval functions. However, the online payment problem and mutual distrust between cloud platforms and users may hinder the wide adoption of cloud service. In this paper, we construct a blockchain based multi-keyword ranked search with fair payment (BMFP) system, which leverages smart contracts to verify the correctness and completeness of the search result, and automatically execute the fair payment operations. The system realizes public verifiability on a multi-keyword ranked search result. The data owner manages the search authority, and a concrete fair payment smart contract is designed. The BMFP is compatible with Ethereum, and the verification algorithm executed by the smart contract is cost-efficient.

AB The issues in charging guiding for electric vehicles are meaningful studies in recent years, especially for electric taxis which need to be recharged during working hours. However, with the popularity of taxi-booking apps, how to obtain an effective charging guiding for taxis having advance orders becomes an urgent problem to be solved. To optimize various special interests while satisfying the constraints of online advance orders, a charging guiding strategy based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a taxi charging guiding architecture based on consortium blockchain is designed, and an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of charging information disconnection and trust between multiple charging station operators. Secondly, we establish the charging guiding model for electric taxis based on multi-objective optimization. The model aims to meet the constraints of online advance orders, maximize passengers' satisfaction and operators' service efficiency, and minimize the charging costs of taxis. Finally, the optimization model is solved by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed guiding strategy, main urban areas of a city are taken as examples for simulation. The results show that the proposed strategy has increased the passengers' satisfaction by 0.44%, and has decreased the expense cost, the time cost and distance cost by 2.38%, 5.72%, and 17.25% respectively, comparing with PSO based strategy while balancing the utilization of charging equipment.

AB In the current blockchain network, many participants rationally migrate the pool to receive a better compensation according to their contribution in situations where the pools they engage encounter undesirable attacks. The Nash equilibria of attacked pool has been widely analyzed, but the analysis of practical methodology for obtaining it is still inadequate. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic analysis of Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchain network in order to investigate the mining pool dynamics affected by malicious inflltrators and the feasibility of autonomous migration among individual miners. We formulate a revenue model for mining pools which are implicitly allowed to launch a block withholding attack. Under our mining game, we analyze the evolutionary stability of Nash equilibrium with replicator dynamics, which can explain the population change with time between participated pools. Further, we explore the statistical approximation of successful mining events to show the necessity of artiflcial manipulation for migrating. Finally, we construct a better response learning based on the required block size which can lead to our evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with numerical results that support our theoretical discoveries.

AB Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) integrates various types of mobile devices and communication technologies to upgrade the traditional face-to-face medical treatment model to intelligent one, which can provide the flexible and convenient e-health care. Due to the complexity and openness of Internet, e-health care data is grabbing the interest of cyber attackers. Hence, security and privacy are still our dominant concerns. Fortunately, blockchain technology leverages decentralized or distributed process to ensure data security. A MediBchain-based privacy-preserving mutual authentication for mobile medical cloud architecture (abbreviated to MBPA) is proposed in this paper. MBPA scheme not only mitigates the weaknesses of existing ones, but has other advantages. First, MBPA scheme supports patients anonymity and traceability since the patients identity is hidden in two dynamic anonyms and a static anonym and only the trusted center can recover his/her real identity. Second, each MediBchain node shares a secret value, which realizes authentication with extremely low computional cost between terminals and MediBchain nodes. Finally, MBPA scheme is proven safely against passive and active attacks under elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP) assumption in random oracle model. Hence, these features make MBPA scheme very suitable for computation-limited mobile devices compared with other related existing schemes.

AB Healthcare data management has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years because of its high potential to provide more accurate and cost-efficient patient care. The traditional client-server and cloud-based healthcare data management systems suffer from the issues of single point of failure, data privacy, centralized data stewardship, and system vulnerability. The replication mechanism, and privacy and security features of blockchain have a promising future in the healthcare domain as they can solve some of the inherent issues of the health management system. However, most of the recent research works on blockchain in the healthcare domain have primarily focused on the permission-less Bitcoin network that suffers from drawbacks such as high energy consumption, limited scalability, and low transaction throughput. Consequently, there is a need for a scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, traceable and private blockchain to suit the requirements of the healthcare domain. We propose a lightweight blockchain architecture for the healthcare data management that reduces the computational and communication overhead compared to the Bitcoin network by dividing the network participants into clusters and maintaining one copy of the ledger per cluster. Our architecture introduces the use of canal, that allows secure and confidential transactions within a group of network participants. Furthermore, we propose a solution to avoid forking which is prevalent in the Bitcoin network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in providing security and privacy compared to the Bitcoin network by analyzing different threats and attacks. We also discuss how our proposed architecture addresses the identified threats. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture generates 11 times lower network traffic compared to the Bitcoin network as the number of blocks increases. Our ledger update is 1.13 times faster. Our architecture shows a speedup of 67 in ledger update and 10 times lower network traffic when the number of nodes increases.

AB Smart contract security is an emerging research area that deals with security issues arising from the execution of smart contracts in a blockchain system. Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed. To this end, we conduct a literature review of smart contract security from a software lifecycle perspective. We first analyze the key features of blockchain that can cause security issues in smart contracts and then summarize the common security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. To address these vulnerabilities, we examine recent advances in smart contract security spanning four development phases: 1) security design; 2) security implementation; 3) testing before deployment; and 4) monitoring and analysis. Finally, we outline emerging challenges and opportunities in smart contract security for blockchain engineers and researchers.

AB Low cost, high efficiency, price transparency, and timely settlement of transactions are required for direct transactions between electricity providers and consumers in the microgrids. So the blockchain technology and the continuous double auction mechanism for direct electricity trading have always been a hot topic in the field of microgrids.In order to further reduce the transaction cost of blockchain and increase the transaction efficiency, and to solve the problem of lack of privacy protection for continuous double auction in the existing scheme, a privacy protection scheme of microgrids direct electricity transaction based on consortium blockchain and the continuous double auction is proposed. In it, the combination of consortium blockchain technology and continuous double auction mechanism is applied to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of transactions. In the meanwhile, pseudonyms and pseudonym certificates are generated by fair blind signature technology to realize identity privacy in the continuous double auction. And decentralization and user identity traceability are achieved by using (t, n) threshold secret sharing technology which distributes and recovers the private key of a trusted third party. The theoretical security analysis shows that the privacy protection scheme has higher security. The simulation experiment shows that the consortium blockchain technology has lower cost and higher efficiency in this scheme.

AB Systems based on fog computing produce massive amounts of data; accordingly, an increasing number of fog computing apps and services are emerging. In addition, machine learning (ML), which is an essential area, has gained considerable progress in various research domains, including robotics, neuromorphic computing, computer graphics, natural language processing (NLP), decision-making, and speech recognition. Several researches have been proposed that study how to employ ML to settle fog computing problems. In recent years, an increasing trend has been observed in adopting ML to enhance fog computing applications and provide fog services, like efficient resource management, security, mitigating latency and energy consumption, and traffic modeling. Based on our understanding and knowledge, there is no study has yet investigated the role of ML in the fog computing paradigm. Accordingly, the current research shed light on presenting an overview of the ML functions in fog computing area. The ML application for fog computing become strong end-user and high layers services to gain profound analytics and more smart responses for needed tasks. We present a comprehensive review to underline the latest improvements in ML techniques that are associated with three aspects of fog computing: management of resource, accuracy, and security. The role of ML in edge computing is also highlighted. Moreover, other perspectives related to the ML domain, such as types of application support, technique, and dataset are provided. Lastly, research challenges and open issues are discussed.

AB Cloud forensics is an intelligent evolution of digital forensics that defends against cyber-crimes. However, centralized evidence collection and preservation minimizes the reliability of digital evidence. To resolve this severe problem, this paper proposes a novel digital forensic architecture using fast-growing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain technology for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. In this proposed forensic architecture, the evidence is collected and preserved in the blockchain that is distributed among multiple peers. To protect the system from unauthorized users, Secure Ring Verification based Authentication (SRVA) scheme is proposed. To strengthen the cloud environment, secret keys are generated optimally by using Harmony Search Optimization (HSO) algorithm. All data are encrypted based on the sensitivity level and stored in the cloud server. For encryption, Sensitivity Aware Deep Elliptic Curve Cryptography (SA-DECC) algorithm is presented. For every data stored in the cloud, a block is created in the SDN controller and the history of data is recorded as metadata. In each block, the Merkle hash tree is built by using Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3). Our system allows users to trace their data by deploying Fuzzy based Smart Contracts (FCS). Finally, evidence analysis is enabled by constructing Logical Graph of Evidence (LGoE) collected from the blockchain. Experiments are conducted in an integrated environment of java (for cloud and blockchain) and network simulator-3.26 (for SDN). The extensive analysis shows that proposed forensic architecture shows promising results in Response time, Evidence insertion time, Evidence verification time, Communication overhead, Hash computation time, Key generation time, Encryption time, Decryption time and total change rate.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) plays a big role in automating information generation and consumption in industrial monitoring applications. Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial <italic>process</italic>. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility.

AB The feedback control loop is the atomic unit in a control system. Typically, feedback control loops are rigid objects that involve a dynamical system, or plant, which has a set of its output states measured by dedicated sensors, which in turn feed a processing unit, known as controller, that calculates actions to be applied as inputs to the plant, via elements known as actuators, in order to drive the outputs to a desired value or trajectory. The appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, where a large number of sensors and processing units interact over a communication network, offers an underlying infrastructure to operate and configure control loops using a different logic: an on-demand strategy. This work introduces the concept of on-demand control loop, and proposes the use of blockchain technology as the enabling infrastructure for generating on-demand control loops over large-scale IoT environments. General design guidelines are given and a simple implementation example over the Ethereum blockchain is presented, which shows the feasibility of the proposed technique.

AB This paper explores the role of metaphors in the production of re-descriptions of the world within the framework of technological design processes. Drawing on a collaborative ethnography with the Economic Space Agency (ECSA), a start-up developing post-blockchain technology, this paper illustrates how metaphors mimic the toponymy of decentralized material infrastructures, while simultaneously pushing forward 'posthuman' values that are expected to become fixated through software. Through an analysis of a 'collection' of metaphors produced by ECSA, this paper sheds light on the work performed by specific vocabularies, within technological communities, in shaping a symbiotic relationship between futuristic politics and material culture.

AB The article presents a comparative analysis of information security threats and currently used methods of protection in networks with a dynamic architecture. Approaches based on centralized and decentralized public key infrastructures, as well as a reputational approach to authentication of network nodes, are considered, their drawbacks are noted. The basic principles of the trust concept between nodes in self-organizing networks with a dynamic architecture are given. A grapho-analytical model of key distribution based on a blockchain-like data registry is proposed.

AB Research on electric profiles analysis is gaining momentum due to the smart meters rollout around the world and with big datasets being produced. Furthermore, new business models taking advantage of peer to peer schemes, blockchain technologies and decentralized electricity generation from renewable energy sources are emerging.
   The main objective of this paper is to characterize and typify consumer load profiles by economic sector and power level, later evaluating their potential complementarity and links to solar photovoltaic generation. It was performed a set of statistical data analysis over 15-minute electricity consumption data registries of the years 2014/2015 from a sample of over 3000 smart meters from the most relevant 10 economic sectors of a city. The city of tvora in Portugal was used as a case study.
   The results show that it has been possible to typify annual and daily profiles (mainly daily profiles) in several sectors, namely: public administration, retail, education, public lighting, health, and services. Additionally, it was disclosed that there is a huge complementarity between important economic sectors (either at a daily or seasonal level and with different power levels) identifying shared investments opportunities on PV systems.
   This work allowed to go forward in the analysis of electricity consumption at high temporal granularity, indicating its interest to improve the electric consumption rationality and promote the integration of renewables energies in many economic sectors.

TI A System with Zero Reserves and with Clearing Outside of the Central
   Bank: The Canadian Case
SO REVIEW OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE Clearing and settlement; overnight interest rate; systemic risk;
   government deposits
AB In a number of ways, implementing monetary policy in Canada stands apart from monetary policy in most other industrial countries. Commercial banks and other participants to the main clearinghouse - the large-value transfer system (LVTS) - hold no reserves at the central bank. Clearing and settlement is both in real time and net, while only settlement occurs on the books of the central bank. The Bank of Canada does not conduct open-market operations and rarely intervenes in the repo market; and despite this, the collateralized overnight rate always remains within 2 or 3 basis points of the target interest rate. The paper explains why this is so by describing the setup of the Canadian clearing and settlement system, including the rules that have been put forward in case a bank defaults on its due payments before settlement occurs. Some puzzles that arose through the years are also discussed, as well as the unlikely prospect of introducing blockchain technology in the Canadian clearing and settlement system.

DE Blockchain; Data Science; Master Program; Curriculum
AB Since appearance of www protocol in 1991, the trend in different aspects of e-commerce is diminishing the role of mediators. "Disintermediation" become the keyword defining many e-commerce technologies. Bitcoin, the original application motivated development of Blockchain technology, aimed removing banks as the mediators and trusted third party in financial transactions. But the scope of this underlying technology is much broader than purely the word of cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers new paradigm of connectivity, information exchange and information use, exploring decentralized, distributed data processing, and encrypting via public and private keys.
   Blockchain was launched as the underlying technology in introducing bitcoins. Research conducted on the dynamics of publications addressing Blockchain, shows that this technology deserted recently from purely bitcoin / crypto-currencies application domain. The intensity of publication addressing applications of this technology demonstrated its relevance to different business domains, mostly Internet of Things (IoT), but also sectors as Energy, Healthcare, and Finance, mostly related to retailed services.
   Consideration of Blockchain technology from this broader perspective, justify the needs of introducing it to students in fields like Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology, but it is especially valuable for programs training Data Science competences.
   The paper shares experience of introducing Blockchain technology, which is still in its infantry stage according to maturity life cycle, in Data Science Master Program. Resolving problems like lack of sufficient well-developed training materials, lack of competent trainers, and lack of adequate equipment to experiment are among the overcome major barriers.
   Dynamics of innovations in area of information technologies and shortening the life cycle from discovery to wide distribution forces education institutions, traditionally conservative in adopting innovation, to develop experience in fast adjustment of their curriculum to react to the emerging challenges. The case of incorporated Blockchain related content into curriculum is discussed as a possible practice.

AB With the deepening of the supply side reform, the development and application of block chain technology in the supply chain of logistics service has arisen extensive attention from all walks of life. As a new technology, block chain can effectively solve the problem of supply and demand structure jumbled, incomplete information sharing and fault cascading in logistics service chain, and then improve the service quality of supply chain of logistics service comprehensively. Based on this, this paper constructs a block supply chain of logistics service model and studies the application of block chain technology in supply chain of logistics service management from three dimensions of object domain, functional domain and attribute domain on the basis of exploring the feasibility of block chain technology in supply chain of logistics service. In order to enhance the supply chain of logistics service management integration and efficiency to provide a theoretical basis for reference.

AB Internet of things (IoT) is becoming increasingly important and ubiquitous in home and industries. It makes object a part of the Internet and fuses the digital and physical world together. However, if not properly secured, IoT device can be vulnerable to tampering that can change the content of the data stored in the network. Blockchain, a technology used in cryptocurrency, can be used for addressing the security and privacy challenges in IoT. Blockchain can be beneficial to IoT by adding more security layer and reducing dependency on a central authority. This paper proposed to develop a blockchain based platform for IoT application. Blockchain technology can be utilized to provide a decentralized network, creating a more secured IoT system. The proposed blockchain network will be based on Ethereum blockchain network allowing the use smart contract application for management of loT devices. Experiment is conducted to show the feasibility of the blockchain based platform. The proposed blockchain based platform is capable of managing several IoT devices connected to the network.

AB The enlargement of cyber-physical ubiquitous frameworks is led byThe Internet of Things (IoT) that gives upswing toward an enormous system of allied smart devices. In recent years very rapid growth and deep concern is perceived in advancing the smart systems for industrial,agricultural and domestic use to enable the identification of unprecedented solutions. Heterogeneous bids are raised and installed in this placewhich grasped the strengthen presence of wireless, radio-frequency identification (RFID), mobile, and exact radar appliances. Nevertheless, for the future, the modern internet appliancesmodel along with old cloud-based architecture remained not designed. It becomes difficult for the future needs to bond the billions of systems by the central processing model. connectivity cost, sensor data of meaningful value creation, traceability, setting-up digital confidence, reliability, intercepting focus of power, recalcitrant intricacy, security, latency, and privacy are heterogeneous dimensions that linked with the paramount bottleneck. To make the distributed IoT work the conception of decentralization in IoT space was the only solution to overcome the above stated hurdles. The present paper brings into view the existing place of research on IoT and its needful prospective professionalthrough the thematic analysis of distributed IoT. This paper also illustrates the prospects in decentralization ecosystem, variegated tasks and latitudes, which provide the pathways for the future researches.

AB Blockchains and smart contracts are an emerging, promising technology, that has received considerable attention. We use the blockchain technology, and in particular Ethereum, to implement a large-scale event-based Internet of Things (IoT) control system. We argue that the distributed nature of the "ledger," as well as, Ethereum's capability of parallel execution of replicated "smart contracts", provide the sought after automation, generality, flexibility, resilience, and high availability. We design a realistic blockchain-based IoT architecture, using existing technologies while by taking into consideration the characteristics and limitations of IoT devices and applications. Furthermore, we leverage blockchain's immutability and Ethereum's support for custom tokens to build a robust and efficient token-based access control mechanism. Our evaluation shows that our solution is viable and offers significant security and usability advantages.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is quickly growing with a wide range of current and planned future applications. As the technology grows in usage, the data gathered by UAV systems as well as the UAVs themselves will become bigger targets for cyber-attacks. New cyber security technologies, such as the immutable ledger technology known as blockchain, should therefore be applied to provide a defense against the growing threat of cyber-attacks. This paper explores blockchain technology, first through a general overview of its components and characteristics, and then at what security improvements it can provide to a system. Following this exploration, the application of blockchain to a UAV swarm environment is briefly expanded on. Lastly, one such blockchain framework known as Hyperledger Fabric is explored, that could potentially be applied to a swarm of UAVs to increase its security.

AB Secure access control to a wide variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become critical. Blockchain-based access control frameworks are promising technologies to support secure access to IoT devices in pervasive computing applications. However, in most of the proposed solutions, the IoT devices rely on a trusted server to retrieve critical access control data from the blockchains. We propose a method for IoT devices to validate blockchain data without solely being dependent on a central server. In our approach, several witnesses on the network can be selected randomly by the devices to validate access control information. Our method is aided by Bloom filters, which are shown to be lightweight for resource-constrained devices.

   IoT devices
AB We present and evaluate models that allow clients to access IoT resources using secure and trusted device-to-device (D2D) communication, while utilizing smart contracts to obtain the benefits of blockcain technology. These benefits include decentralized trust, immutability, transparency, and high availability. The models consider different network connection capabilities of the clients and the IoT resources, namely continuous network connectivity and D2D-only connectivity. We describe two approaches for utilizing blockchains and smart contracts in the authorization process: in the first approach, only hashes of the authorization information are recorded on the blockchain. In the second approach, a smart contract handles authorization requests. We implement the approaches using the OAuth 2.0 delegated authorization framework and evaluate the implementations on the public Ethereum testnet Rinkeby, in terms of execution cost, contract creation cost, and delay. Our evaluation quantifies the tradeoffs of blockchain cost and smart contract functionality, such as blocking and non-blocking operation, and the reduction of the transaction cost that can be achieved when multiple authorization requests are concatenated in a single transaction.

AB Due to the advantages of blockchain technologies, including decentralization, immutability, transparency and security, people try to replace existing problematic architectures/frameworks with blockchain based ones. In this paper we propose a novel authentication and authorization framework based on blockchain technologies to control access to the resources of an IoT device. In this paper, we focus on devices such as the Cyber Handyman used in remote collaboration applications to develop our framework. We tested our smart contracts on the Ropsten test network. Our results showed that it can handle 25 service requests simultaneously.

DE Blockchain Peer-to-Peer network; Network clustering; Network topology;
   Broadcast algorithm
AB Blockchain technology offers an intelligent amalgamation of distributed ledger, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), cryptography, and smart contracts to enable trustworthy applications without any third parties. Existing blockchain systems have successfully either resolved the scalability issue by advancing the distributed consensus protocols from the control plane, or complemented the security issue by updating the block structure and encryption algorithms from the data plane. Yet, we argue that the underlying P2P network plane remains as an important but unaddressed barrier for accelerating the overall blockchain system performance. Our key insights from comparative assessments reveal the fact that P2P topology highly affects the broadcast speed of blockchain data, leading to poor performance and vulnerable to double spending attacks. In this paper, we introduce BlockP2P, a novel optimization design to accelerate broadcast efficiency and meanwhile retain the security. BlockP2P first operates the geographical proximity sensing clustering, which leverages K-Means algorithm for gathering proximity peer nodes into clusters. It follows by the hierarchical topological structure that ensures strong connectivity and small diameter based on node attribute classification. We finally propose the parallel spanning tree broadcast algorithm to enable fast data broadcast among nodes both in the intra- and inter- clusters. To clarify the influence of each tier, we carefully design and implement a blockchain network simulator. Evaluation results show that BlockP2P can exhibit promising performance compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

AB Electronic health record (EHR) has recorded the process of occurrence, development, and treatment of diseases. So it has high medical value. Owing to the private and sensitive nature of medical data for patients, the data sharing and privacy preservation are critical issues in EHR. Blockchain technology may be a promising solution for the problems above since it holds the features of decentralization and tamper resistance. In the paper, we propose a medical data sharing and protection scheme based on the hospital's private blockchain to improve the electronic health system of the hospital. Firstly, the scheme can satisfy various security properties such as decentralization, openness, and tamper resistance. A reliable mechanism is created for the doctors to store medical data or access the historical data of patients while meeting privacy preservation. Furthermore, a symptoms-matching mechanism is given between patients. It allows patients who get the same symptoms to conduct mutual authentication and create a session key for their future communication about the illness. The proposed scheme is implemented by using PBC and OpenSSL libraries. Finally, the security and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is given.

In recent years, many new crypto-coins have been developed, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, VeChain, Neo, Lisk, Binance, Monero, among others. All of them employ blockchain technology. This research aims to analyze the benefits and risks perceived by users as determinants of the use of crypto coins in Brazil. Prospects for advancement in blockchain technology are very large. This research uses as a theoretical background the Technology Acceptance Model, strongly inspired by the statistical modeling of Abramova and Bohme (2016), with the inclusion of theoretical constructs: Perceived Benefit, Perceived Use Ease, Perceived Risk. These constructs aim to explain the endogenous construct Possibility and Use Behavior and significant determinants, using the multivariate statistical method of modeling Structural Equations. The results demonstrate that the benefit perceived by the individual is the main factor that positively influences the users of cryptocurrency. In addition, the risks perceived by the individuals were not significant for the results, divergent than expected, from the determinants financial losses, legal risk and operational risk.

SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain technology is growing everyday at a fast-passed rhythm and it is possible to integrate it with many systems, namely Robotics with AI services. However, this is still a recent field and there is not yet a clear understanding of what it could potentially become. In this paper, we conduct an overview of many different methods and platforms that try to leverage the power of blockchain into robotic systems, to improve AI services, or to solve problems that are present in the major blockchains, which can lead to the ability of creating robotic systems with increased capabilities and security. We present an overview, discuss the methods, and conclude the paper with our view on the future of the integration of these technologies.

DT Review
ID BITCOIN; EVOLUTION; NETWORK
AB A comparative study across the most widely known blockchain technologies is conducted with a bottom-up approach. Blockchains are deconstructed into their building blocks. Each building block is then hierarchically classified into main and subcomponents. Then, varieties of the subcomponents are identified and compared. A taxonomy tree is used to summarise the study and provide a navigation tool across different blockchain architectural configurations.

DT Article
ID SWARM
AB This paper proposes a blockchain-based mapping protocol for distributed robotic systems running on embedded hardware. This protocol was developed for a robotic system designed to locomote on lattice structures for space applications. A consensus mechanism, Proof of Validity, is introduced to allow the effort of mining blocks to correlate with the desired tasks the robotic system was designed for. These robots communicate using peer-to-peer LoRa radio. Options, trade-offs and considerations for implementing blockchain technology on an embedded system with wireless radio communication are explored and discussed.

TI A Decentralized Context Broker Using Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB A context broker is a reliable message-relaying service used to connect devices by integrating all device protocols and communication methods, and reliably transporting messages while isolating data from other application service layers and networking complexities. A highly scalable decentralized context broker stack is composed of three layers-starting with a peer-to-peer network connecting a byzantine fault-tolerant (i.e., blockchain-based) consensus protocol-and it manages the communication using a web-socket streaming protocol as interface to other applications. This paper presents such a concept for a decentralized context broker stack for intercommunication between heterogeneous materials handling systems, and deploys the stack as proof-of-concept using ROS-based robots in a logistics scenario.

TI SwarmDAG: A Partition Tolerant Distributed Ledger Protocol for Swarm

SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt applications beyond cryptocurrencies. This work applies the concepts of blockchain technology to swarm robotics applications. Swarm robots typically operate in a distributed fashion, wherein the collaboration and coordination between the robots are essential to accomplishing the application goals. However, robot swarms may experience network partitions either due to navigational and communication challenges or in order to perform certain tasks efficiently. We propose a novel protocol, SwarmDAG, that enables the maintenance of a distributed ledger based on the concept of extended virtual synchrony while managing and tolerating network partitions.

TI Robotchain: Using Tezos Technology for Robot Event Management
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Robots are important equipment in the modern day factory environment. To maintain and improve factory productivity, ledgers containing robotic actions may be used to identify possible bottleneck points in an assembly line or to serve as a record of in unintentional behaviours, be it of a malicious nature or not. In this paper we present Robotchain, a possible solution using blockchain technology, that prevents unwanted changes in a robotic action ledger and provides a way to use the said ledger in order to aid in production efficiency or other management requirements. This paper also presents an initial experimental study of the Tezos blockchain in order to understand the challenges related to using its advanced blockchain technology for the Robotchain implementation.

TI Blockchains, Real-time Accounting, and the Future of Credit Risk
   Modeling
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper I discuss how blockchains potentially could affect the way credit risk is modeled, and how the improved trust and timing associated with blockchain-enabled real-time accounting could improve default prediction. To demonstrate the (quite substantial) effect the change would have on well-known credit risk measures, a simple case-study compares Z-scores and Merton distances to default computed using typical accounting data of today to the same risk measures computed under a hypothetical future blockchain regime.

TI A Blockchain Enhanced Framework for Social Networking
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Social networking sites have given users unprecedented opportunities for the generation and dissemination of content. A variety of social networking sites exist for different purposes, to afford users a range of anonymous and non-anonymous options for self-expression, and the ability to be a part of a virtual community. These "affordances" enable users to create and share content;(1,2) however, the ability to partially or wholly detach user identity from the content has resulted in unique challenges for content access and content attribution. This paper proposes a framework for secure, trustworthy social networking that also creates value for user-generated content by using a blockchain-enhanced framework for social networking. This work explains the application of such a framework for collocated spaces of robots and IoT devices and identifies key challenges that result as a consequence of merging social networking sites and blockchain technology.

TI Transaction Fees, Block Size Limit, and Auctions in Bitcoin
SO LEDGER
LA English
DT Article
AB Confirmation of Bitcoin transactions is executed in blocks, which are then stored in the Blockchain. As compared to the number of transactions in the mempool, the set of transactions which are verified but not yet confirmed, available space for inclusion in a block is typically limited. For this reason, successful miners can only process a subset of such transactions, and users compete with each other to enter the next block by offering confirmation fees. Assuming that successful miners pursue revenue maximization, they will include in the block those mempool transactions that maximize earnings from related fees. In the paper we model transaction fees as a Nash Equilibrium outcome of an auction game with complete information. In the game the successful miner acts as an auctioneer selling block space, and users bid for shares of such space to confirm their transactions. Moreover, based on expected fees we also discuss what the optimal, revenue maximizing, block size limit should be for the successful miner. Consistently with the intuition, the optimal block size limit resolves the trade-off between including additional transactions (which possibly lower the unit fees collected) and keeping the block capacity limited (with, however, higher unit fees).

AB We outline a quantum-enabled blockchain architecture based on a consortium of quantum servers. The network is hybridised, utilising digital systems for sharing and processing classical information combined with a fibre-optic infrastructure and quantum devices for transmitting and processing quantum information. We deliver an energy-efficient interactive mining protocol enacted between clients and servers which uses quantum information encoded in light and removes the need for trust in network infrastructure. Instead, clients on the network need only trust the transparent network code, and that their devices adhere to the rules of quantum physics. To demonstrate the energy efficiency of the mining protocol, we elaborate upon the results of two previous experiments (one performed over 1km of optical fibre) as applied to this work. Finally, we address some key vulnerabilities, explore open questions, and observe forward-compatibility with the quantum internet and quantum computing technologies.

AB In the traditional medical system, individual medical data is managed by hospitals rather than individual patients. It is difficult to exchange effectively with fragmented storage, and large amounts of data are difficult to realize their potential value. With the rapid development of medical informatization, centralized storage of fragmented medical data has been unable to meet the relevant needs of the medical industry. To solve the difficulty of sharing and the complexity of confirming rights in the medical system, this paper proposes a medical data sharing model based on blockchain. The model provides reliable storage with IPFS file system, uses Proxy re-encryption to realize data sharing and ensure data proprietary rights, and uses Token economic system to measure the contribution in the sharing process, which stimulates the enthusiasm of sharing. At last, based on the existing sharing problem of medical data, the paper shows the potential solution.

AB Traditional tea sets are biased on the design, manufacture and sale of handicrafts. In the context of Blockchain, the comparison of tea makers' consumer wishes and data statistics, combined with the design cloud service platform, will inevitably bring about a huge change in the design industry chain. Through two experiments, this paper reveals the relationship between consumer and product closeness, psychological distance and social distance. At the same time, based on the research and analysis of tea product design impact factor, it is uploaded to the product design cloud service platform. Let users mine design requirements, set up design teams, establish an open and shared industrial design, network interaction environment, and realize the design life cycle process through collaboration between front-end and back-end of the cloud service platform, combined with corresponding access technologies and virtualization technologies. Sharing and collaboration will also provide data and technical support for the breakthrough of the block industry chain in the later period.

AB In recent years, the sharing economy has not only become a new economic model that has received widespread attention, but also created enormous economic value. Many traditional industries have entered the sharing economy, including home appliance companies. However, under the business policy of gaining profits through manufacturing increments, many shared economic enterprises have encountered difficulties. Based on the resources of idle household appliances, targeting the huge second-hand home appliance market, based on big data, Internet of Things and block chain technologies, and propose feasible home appliance production technology improvement programs, it can become the main resource for shared home appliances. This paper establish a new shared appliance operation mode from a technical perspective, and provide reference to the horizontal development of home appliance enterprises and new enterprise positioning.

AB Global agricultural trade flows demonstrated a three-fold growth during the past decade particularly in emerging economies. At the same time, global food scandals in conjunction with the spillover effects in economy and society highlight the unreliability of existing food tracking systems and the inefficiency in monitoring food quality and fraud incidents across global food supply chains (SCs). Blockchain technology (BCT), which has already been successfully applied on the financial industry to validate critical transactions, seems to be a promising option. This research investigates a two-stage containerized food SC by implementing a demonstrator application at the Hyperledger Fabric framework. The study findings indicates that on one hand BCT has entered its maturity phase while on the other hand its adoption in food SC operations could add significant value by authenticating critical parameters and providing enhanced traceability. At the same time, BCT enabled by other digital technologies could allow for the optimization of global food SCs. Thus, BCT constitutes a promising digital technology that provides the capability to food SC stakeholders to securely share information, enhance process control and traceability and prevent potential risks.

AB Peer-to-peer trading of utilities (heating, cooling and electric power) in an eco-industrial park (EIP) is key to realize significant economic and environmental benefits by exploiting synergistic co-generation and surplus trading. A crucial aspect of this symbiotic scheme is that each selfish company (prosumer) will participate in exchanging utilities to increase its own profits depending on its internal load. In this paper, an automated negotiation approach based on utility tokens is proposed to incentivize participation in a market of prosumer peers for trading surpluses in an EIP. During each negotiation episode, a pair of prosumers engage in a bilateral negotiation and resort to a learned policy to bid, concede and accept/reject using both private information and environmental variables. Contract negotiation revolves around agreeing (or not) on the price expressed in tokens of a utility profile. The time-varying value of the utility token accounts for contextual variables beyond the control of each prosumer. Simulation results demonstrate that reinforcement learning allows finding Nash equilibrium policies for smart contract negotiation in a blockchain environment.

AB Across the world, the organisation and operation of the electricity markets is quickly changing, moving towards decentralised, distributed, renewables-based generation with real-time data exchange-based solutions. In order to support this change, blockchain-based distributed ledgers have been proposed for implementation of peer-to-peer energy trading platform. However, blockchain solutions suffer from scalability problems as well as from delays in transaction confirmation. This paper explores the feasibility of using IOTA's DAG-based block-free distributed ledger for implementation of energy trading platforms. Our agent-based simulation research demonstrates that an IOTA-like DAG-based solution could overcome the constraints that blockchains face in the energy market. However, to be usable for peer-to-peer energy trading, even DAG-based platforms need to consider specificities of energy trading markets (such as structured trading periods and assured confirmation of transactions for every completed period).

AB Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business processes involving mutually untrusted parties. Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools brush aside the question of who is allowed to execute which tasks in the process, either by deferring the question altogether or by adopting a static approach where all actors are bound to roles upon process instantiation. Yet, a key advantage of blockchains is their ability to support dynamic sets of actors. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles and constraints.

DE Process collaboration; Process models; Compliance rules
AB Collaboration is a key factor to successful businesses. To face massive competition in which SMEs compete with well established corporates, organizations tend to focus on their core businesses while delegating other tasks to their partners. Lately, Blockchain technology has yet furthered and eased the way companies collaborate in a trust-less environment. As such, interest in researching process collaborations models and techniques has been growing. However, in contrast to BPM research for intra-organizational processes, where a multitude of process models repositories exist as a support for simulation and work evaluation, the lack of such repositories in the context of inter-organizational processes has become an inconvenience. The aim of this paper is to build a repository of collaborative process models that will assist the research in this area. A top-down approach is used to automatically generate constrained and compliant choreography models, from which public and private process models are derived. Though the generation is partly random, it complies to a predefined set of compliance rules and parameters specified by the user.

AB In the environment of the current trend towards digitalization of the world economy, the issue of the legal regulation of the institute of digital financial assets as well as the activity relating to the generation of these assets is of considerable interest. As practice shows, individual countries face the situation where these assets are already turning over, but there is still no legal regulation. This state of affairs may give rise to cases of illegal turnover of financial assets and fraud in this sphere. Presently, the geopolitical map on digitalization of the economy is fragmented. Some countries have recognized and legalized the turnover of digital financial assets, others have so far not adopted an unambiguous attitude with respect to this new institute, while a third group of countries has not even recognized their legal nature nor their very existence. This ambiguity raises many issues relating to the legitimacy of digital financial assets and the feasibility of the introduction of this new financial product. The article analyzes the state of the legal regulation of the institute of digital financial assets in the BR/CS countries, considers the standpoints of legislators and scientists on the legal nature of these financial assets.

AB We consider fault-tolerant boolean formulas in which the output of a faulty gate is short-circuited to one of the gate's inputs. A recent result by Kalai et al. [FOCS 2012] converts any boolean formula into a resilient formula of polynomial size that works correctly if less than a fraction 1/6 of the gates (on every input-to-output path) are faulty. We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction 1/5 of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size.
   Towards our results, we consider interactive coding schemes when noiseless feedback is present; these produce resilient boolean formulas via a Karchmer-Wigderson relation. We develop a coding scheme that resists up to a fraction 1/5 of corrupted transmissions in each direction of the interactive channel. We further show that such a level of noise is maximal for coding schemes with sub-exponential blowup in communication. Our coding scheme takes a surprising inspiration from Blockchain technology.

AB Security and Privacy are some of the important aspects to be considered in the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Due to the large number of IoT devices and the different administrative domains in which they operate, traditional approaches involving a Centralized server for managing Authorizations will not be scalable or efficient. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Capability-Based Access Control framework using IOTA (DCACI); IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger that enables fee-less micro transactions for the IoT. The DCACI framework enables complete privacy and integrity of the Capability tokens using IOTA's Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) technology. It enables device owners and users to Grant, Update, Delegate and Revoke the capability tokens. The proposed DCACI framework has been implemented as a proof-of-concept on a resource constrained machine; the results indicate that it is capable of scaling up to large-scale infrastructure such as a Smart City, having millions of IoT devices.

AB Blockchain is one of the most popular topics for discussion now. However, most experts still see this technology as only part of Bitcoin, other crypto-currencies or money transfer systems. Often, new solutions, proposed by young researchers, are blocked by reviewers, only because these solutions can not be used for Bitcoins. However, Blockchain technology is more universal and can be used also in other areas, for example, in IoT, WSN and mobile devices.
   This paper considers the implementation of Blockchain technology in sensor networks as an element of IoT. The concept of "Rolling Blockchain" was proposed, which can be used to build WSN with the participation of Smart Cars, as nodes of the network.
   The order of block formation and structure in the chain is proposed and a mathematical model is created for it. We estimate the optimal number of WSN nodes, the number of connections between nodes, for specified network reliability values, was performed.

AB In recent years, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has been playing a more and more important role in building trust and security for Internet of Things (IoT). However, the unacceptable performance of the current mainstream DLT systems such as Bitcoin can hardly meet the efficiency and scalability requirements of IoT. In this paper, we propose a scalable transactive smart homes infrastructure by leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based DLT and following the separation of concerns (SOC) design principle. Based on the proposed solution, an experiment with 40 Home Nodes is conducted to prove the concepts. From the results, we find that our solution provides a high transaction speed and scalability, as well as good performance on security and micropayment which are important in IoT settings. Then, we conduct an analysis and discuss how the new system breaks out the well-known Trilemma, which claims that it is hard for a DLT platform to simultaneously reach decentralization, scalability and security. Finally, we conclude that the proposed DAG-based distributed ledger is an effective solution for building an IoT infrastructure for smart communities.

AB Blockchains offer an interesting solution to some of the security challenges encountered in military applications. They are particularly attractive in the scenarios, where it is difficult or even impossible to establish a common root of trust, e.g., in the context of civil-military collaboration, where military organizations need to build trusted information exchange infrastructure with various types of civilian governmental and non-governmental organizations, local communities, commercial companies and private persons. In our work, we discuss how blockchain can be used to store metadata describing information collected from the IoT devices owned by the federation members as well as crowdsourced from sensors belonging to private users. We present a high level architecture for a metadata binding solution using blockchains compliant with STANAG 4774 and 4778. We also describe a concrete technical solution based on Hyperledger Fabric and some of the open issues.

DE delegated authorization; smart contracts; hash time-locked payments
AB We present models for utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology with the widely used OAuth 2.0 open authorization framework to provide delegated authorization for constrained IoT devices. The models involve different trade-offs in terms of privacy, delay, and cost, while exploiting key advantages of blockchains and smart contracts. These include linking payments to authorization grants, immutably recording authorization information and policies in smart contracts, and offering resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes.

AB While direct allocation of spectrum and evolved medium access protocols provide a base for ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the existing TCP/IP and OSI models were designed for wired networks and do not address open interconnection of air interfaces. Without an interworking model for the air interface, existing network designs continue to tie wireless medium access to that of the backhaul provider for ownership of access and identity trust, resulting in limitations on functionality and coverage.
   In this paper, we propose a novel solution to access ownership and identity trust by extending the TCP network standard, under a new model we propose, named TCP-Air which integrates distributed ledger technologies directly at the air interface. Further, we present two use cases of the TCP-Air model, demonstrating applications not feasible under existing permissioned-access network designs.

AB The blockchain is a secure and trustworthy distributed transaction management system that is being extensively researched and developed for various applications and use cases. This study introduces a novel distributed control system using the Blockchain. A multi-robot path planning application is developed and deployed to benchmark a blockchain platform, the Hyperledger Fabric. Blockchain technology has the reputation of being sufficiently dilatory that it is inappropriate for time-sensitive applications. This research demonstrates how the enterprise-grade blockchain solutions overcome this shortcoming and investigates their potential for enabling secure and trusted distributed control systems for IoT.

AB Current new IoT standards do not detail enough some important and emergent aspects as the Fog/Edge computing support, the IoT computation topology management or the IoT visualization systems. This work defines three new concepts: a) the paradigm of edge/cloud computing transparency that lets the computation nodes change dynamically without administrator intervention; b) the IoT computing topology management that gives an IoT system global view, from the hardware and communication infrastructures to the software deployed on them, and c) the automation and integration of IoT visualization systems for real time data visualization, current IoT topology and current paths of data flows. It is also defined a new architectural model that includes these concepts and covers other IoT demands, like security safeguard services based on Blockchain. This architectural model definition is taken as the basis for developing a new advanced IoT platform referred as SAT-IoT.

   algebraic service composition
AB With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), scalability becomes a significant concern due to the huge amounts of data generated in IoT systems. A centralized data exchange is not desirable as it leads to a single performance bottleneck. Although a distributed data exchange removes the central bottleneck, it has network performance issues as data passes among multiple coordinators. A decentralized approach is the only solution that fully enables the realization of efficient IoT systems, since there is no single performance bottleneck and network overhead is minimized. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the semantics of DX-MAN for realizing decentralized data flows in IoT systems. The algebraic semantics of such a model allows a well-defined structure of data flows which is easily analyzed by an algorithm that forms a direct relationship between data consumers and data producers. For the analysis, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that DX-MAN separates control flow and data flow. Thus, our approach prevents passing data alongside control among multiple coordinators, so data is only read and written on a decentralized data space. We validate our approach using smart contracts on the Blockchain, and conducted experiments to quantitatively evaluate scalability. The results show that our approach scales well with the size of IoT systems.

AB The proliferation of the Internet of Things has seen it adopted to practically all aspects of life. There has been an increase in demand for more IoT devices which are manufactured by several companies. This has however left need to address vulnerabilities within and threats to these devices. In many cases, these vulnerabilities arise from manufacturer focus on functionality rather than security. Secure by design IoT devices are rare in the market today. Efforts to address this are being made by the IoT research community, however, more effort is required. Deficiencies of current efforts include accountability of devices and privacy of data generated across the IoT landscape. The aim of this Ph.D. research is to improve the security, privacy, veracity, and trust. The approach developed in this study will be based on non-repudiation of actions among self-organized IoT devices in an IoT Ecosystem by leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). A proposed system architecture which relies on the Distributed Ledger Technology and its related features will enable services to be applied to the IoT landscape to achieve aspects of end to end IoT security. The initial progress to date is presented within this manuscript.

DE blockchain; industry 4.0; industrial IoT; process quality
AB The complexity of supply chains increase, especially due to the geographical spread of supplier and customer networks. In the connected and automated supply chains of the industry 4.0, even more nodes are incorporated in supply chains. This paper discusses the possible improvement of process quality in the industry 4.0 through the different blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. We derived hypotheses from a literature review and asked German blockchain experts from the industry to validate and discuss the hypotheses. We find that the different blockchain technologies and consensus algorithms have different strength with regard to quality improvement. One central finding is that IOTA, developed especially for the IoT and deemed the 'next evolutionary step' is scalable and hence may increases the process efficiency, but at the same time is more vulnerable than other blockchain implementations, which again may reduce the overall process quality.

DE blockchain; consensus; incentive mechanism; off-chain transaction
AB The blockchain technology is more and more important in computer security. The core of the blockchain system is consensus. However, many consensus mechanisms reward those groups that own the majority of the resources. In addition, the performance of these consensus mechanisms is poor. In this paper we first present Proof of Value (POV), an incentive mechanism that rewards the value creators. With the help of POV, we reward the user who creates value and control the number of coins through the incentive coefficient adjustment algorithm. To improve the performance of POV in permissioned blockchain, we designed Hypernet, an off-chain transaction system. By designing the transaction system Hypernet, the transaction can be handled without blockchain. Finally, we evaluate our system by generating random parameters to invoke the contract. Then we record the real time for issuing the rewards. The test results show that the loss of the system is about 2% when the POV is added. The performance of the Hypernet is four times higher than the traditional permissioned blockchain transaction system.

AB Search and data retrieval services have attracted significant attention in blockchain networks, especially for rare resources. Therefore, our paper proposes a novel Gossip-based appropriate degree search strategy (GADSS) for rare resources. This strategy employs a periodical probing mechanism (PPM) to judge whether these resources are rare resources. Once the resource types are determined, searching probability for rare ones is increased by two-hop index replication with resource weight (TIR-RW). In addition, we also provide a Gossip-based appropriate degree search algorithm (GADSA), which utilizes the appropriate degree property as heuristic information to guide the search in dynamic environment. As compared to the conventional blockchain resource search algorithms, GADSA has the ability to reduce the message quantity substantially. The simulation results show that GADSS has the better search performance for rare resources, and maintains the lower network overhead.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is where almost anything can be controlled and managed remotely. Although the IoT evolution led to quality of life enhancement, many of its devices are insecure. The lack of robust key management systems, efficient identity authentication, low fault tolerance, and many other issues lead IoT devices into being easily targeted by attackers. The aim of this research is to enhance an authentication protocol that helps in the authentication process of IoT devices and CPANs (Personal Area Network Coordinators) in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. To propose a solution for this issue, and to find out the optimal contribution, a comparison and analysis on the current IoT security solutions have been conducted. Based on the analysis, it is found that the superior solution was a Blockchain-based solution called BCTrust. In this paper, the aim is to improve the basis authentication protocol adopted by BCTrust. The protocol is to be improved mainly by two sides, firstly, eliminating the blacklisting mechanism that can be leveraged by attackers to negatively impact the network. Secondly, introducing a new way for generating the identifiers of the IIoT devices. This would enhance the security and efficiency of BCTrust, specifically in the generation of IIoT secret keys.

AB The network revolution is becoming bigger and more complex and data need to be secured against cybercrimes. Cybercrimes caused the loss of billions of dollars affecting the global economy, with the intention to maliciously affect critical and confidential information. With the presence of these crimes committed on a daily basis, the security of the cyberspace has become an urgent reaction to reduce and possibly avoid the effect of cybercrimes. Nowadays, the internet of things (IoT) revolution is becoming the focus of research, and both security and privacy are recognized as the main issues for IoT applications, mainly because of its implementation in critical areas, such as healthcare systems. In this paper, the cybersecurity state in IoT domain along with its security challenges are discussed, also we address some security requirements and techniques to overcome these challenges. Finally, blockchain technology is discussed as a recommended solution to support IoT security.

AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of Bitcoin that allows a peer-to-peer distributed ledger with security and immutability. The core of a blockchain is the consensus mechanism that sets the rule for nodes in handling the shared data. Implementation of the consensus algorithm depends on the nature of targeted business environment. In this research, the performance of two consensus algorithms, Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Collatz Conjecture (PCC), are studied in the context of a private blockchain. A quantitative analysis on the execution time, deployment time, and latency time are done for 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 transactions and the results are presented. The results shows that PCC takes only (1/1000)th of the execution time that is required for PoW for these different sets of transactions. In addition, these timings are recorded for ten repeated executions for the same sets of transactions, and found that PCC has a nearly consistent execution time.

AB IoT trust management is a security solution that assures the trust between different IoT entities before establishing any relationship with other anonymous devices. Recent researches presented in the literature tend to use a Blockchain-based trust management model for IoT besides the fog node approach in order to address the constraints of IoT resources. Actually, Blockchain has solved many drawbacks of centralized models. However, it is still not preferable for dealing with massive data produced by IoT because of its drawbacks such as delay, network overhead, and scalability issues. Therefore, in this paper we define some factors that should be considered when designing scalable models, and we propose a fully distributed trust management model for IoT that provide a large-scale trust model and address the limitations of Blockchain. We design our model based on a new approach called Holochain considering some security issues, such as detecting misbehaviors, data integrity and availability.

AB Supply chain finance combines logistics, information flow and capital flow, which can effectively solve the shortage of funds and reduce the cost of the entire supply chain. Based on the development background of Fujian province's free trade zone and supply chain finance, this paper analyzes the current situation of SME financing in China and Fujian province, and focuses on the insufficient industrial chain of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone. Supply chain financial intermediaries are unbalanced development, inadequate laws and regulations, and relatively weak technology. The paper proposes a comprehensive model of supply chain financing based on free trade zone, carries out QFLP financing for the real economy, develops supply chain financial services for shipping centers, and encourages intermediaries to develop supply chain financial services, improve credit system and legal system, and utilize blockchain technology to improve the informationization degree of supply chain finance and other proposals, promote the rapid development of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone, and solve the financing difficulties of SMEs.

AB For several years, blockchain technology have been used and tested in various prototypes for production environments. The main focus of these approaches is the feasibility of different applications. It is usually simply assumed that data in a blockchain is stored immutably. However, the path from data generation to entry into a blockchain is usually neglected. Exactly this topic is discussed in this paper and a solution proposal for a secure data flow from the machine to the blockchain is presented. For this, the hardware and software architecture of the solution is shown, followed by measurements of the operational capability of the solution.

AB Autonomous Driving car is an upcoming technology. In our project, we are taking a step towards this vision by developing a system using Raspberry Pi, image processing and machine learning and connect the system to any electric car. The proposed system provides an autonomous car feature to any existing electric car on the road that doesn't have autonomous driving feature inbuilt within it. Most existing electric cars that are on roads don't have this technology and this is mostly found in new and expensive cars. An alarming fact about autonomous cars is that many of them are being frequently hacked, indicating a problem related to security. The application of blockchain network, which seems to provide security and transparency in the usage of the network is employed to transfer data. Using the proposed system, such autonomous car feature can be installed separately at a cheaper expense in all existing electric cars. We aim to achieve the above by using image processing which is trained by using neural networks to create a model through which autonomous cars are achieved. With the usage of blockchain network, security and transparency of data transfer can be achieved. The hardware components used in this project are Raspberry PI 3 B microcomputer and camera module. This Raspberry Pi and camera unit forms a separate system which, when connected to the electronic control unit, helps the car to drive automatically.

AB As Blockchain technology become more understood in recent years and its capability to solve enterprise business use cases become evident, technologist have been exploring Blockchain technology to solve use cases that have been daunting industries for years. Unlike existing technologies, one of the key features of blockchain technology is its unparalleled capability to provide, traceability, accountability and immutable records that can be accessed at any point in time. One application area of interest for blockchain is securing heterogenous networks. This paper explores the security challenges in a heterogonous network of IoT devices and whether blockchain can be a viable solution. Using an experimental approach, we explore the possibility of using blockchain technology to secure IoT devices, validate IoT device transactions, and establish a chain of trust to secure an IoT device mesh network, as well as investigate the plausibility of using immutable transactions for forensic analysis.

AB The purpose of the study is to substantiate the benchmarks of digitization of the institutional environment of state financial control in Ukraine based on foreign experience. The methods of qualitative, quantitative, and correlation analysis, graphical modelling, causality tests, comparisons and generalizations were used. Results. The essence of the institutional environment of the state financial control is determined and its contradictions are revealed. It is established that in order to overcome the contradictions of the institutional environment of state financial control, it is necessary to resolve the issue of intensifying its digitalization since the use of financial technologies affects the state of governance. Directions of the digitization of the institutional environment of the state financial control were examined through the prism of relations "control-state", "control-enterprise", "controlsociety", and "control-European Community", with the justification of proposals that should be implemented in the context of isolated components. Practical importance. The digitalization of the institutional environment of state financial control should be based on electronic democracy, parameterization of annual reports of controlling bodies, blockchain interoperability, automation of control measures, use of artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, services based on open data, interactive methods of information sharing (social networks, television programs, and video blogs), and electronic tax fraud identification services in international trade. Value/originality. The level of digitalization of the external institutional environment of the state financial control is higher than the level of digitalization of the internal environment. This creates the basis for the development of the theory of state financial control, as well as the practice of its implementation, which requires appropriate innovative and technological transformations.

ID TRUST
AB Blockchain is currently considered as a key technology that can significantly reduce the level of transaction costs in the economy, reduce the level of economic and financial risks, and increase the efficiency of economy and financial sector.
   In this regard, it is relevant to study the possible trajectories of blockchain transformation under conditions when the state has not yet developed a universal model for blockchain integration into the economic system.
   The blockchain research method as a good is represented by economic sociodynamics, which studies the typology of goods and their transitions under the influence of interests that society presents to a particular product or service. The models of dynamics of social groups of M. Olsen and R. Putnam are also used.
   The endowment of blockchain with the features of a social good by the state shall not be accompanied by the deprivation of blockchain of the properties of a private good that can satisfy private, not just public interests. This will create conditions for increasing the share of Putnam's groups and reducing the share of Olsen's groups, which will increase the level of trust in society and stimulate the improvement of macroeconomic indicators, such as economic growth and increase in the GDP investment share.

AB Games-of-chance require high-levels of trust between participants that is often uncertain and difficult to enforce. The unique characteristics introduced by the blockchain technology can be leveraged to inform a verifiable but transparent pseudo-random generation process that at the same time eliminates the need of an external trustee service or oracle to guarantee the fair execution of the process. We propose a process that builds on a one-dimensional Cellular Automaton (CA) where the evolution of the CA aligns to the evolution of a blockchain. Given an initial seed defined as the point in time where the evolution of the CA is triggered, the set of transition rules, along with the finite number of evolution steps, any external oracle is able to verify and backtrack (but not predict) the outcome of the process. The effectiveness of the implemented system is confirmed by the use of various statistical testing suites that confirm the existence of a set of statistical properties required to produce sufficient pseudo-random number sequences.

AB Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models are created, trained and used by different entities. The entity that curates data used for the model is frequently different from the entity that trains the model, which is different yet again from the end user of the trained model. The end user needs to trust the received AI model, and this requires having the provenance information about how the model was trained, and the data the model was trained on. This chapter describes how blockchain can be used to track the provenance of training models, leading to better trusted Artificial Intelligence.

AB In this paper we review and analyze redundancy-based fault-tolerant techniques for the IoT as a paradigm to support two of the main goals of computer security: availability and integrity. We organized the presentation in terms of the three main tasks performed by the nodes of an IoT network: sensing, routing, and control. We first discuss how the implementation of fault-tolerance in the three areas is primary for the correct operation of an entire system. We provide an overview of the different approaches that have been used to address failures in sensing and routing. Control devices typically implement state machines that take decisions based on the measurement of sensors and may also ask actuators to execute actions. Traditionally state-machine replication for fault-tolerance is realized through consensus protocols. Most protocols were developed in the 80's and 90's. We will review the properties of such protocols in detail and discuss their limitations for the IoT. Since 2008, consensus algorithms took a new direction with the introduction of the concept of blockchain. Standard blockchain based protocols cannot be applied without modifications to support fault-tolerance in the IoT. We will review some recent results in this new class of algorithms, and show how they can provide the flexibility required to support fault-tolerance in control devices, and thus overcome some of the limitations of the traditional consensus protocols.

AB Cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid. Or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable. These critical national infrastructure (CNI) attacks into sectors such as healthcare cause data breaches/disruptions and are also able to leverage vulnerabilities in the industrial processes containing ICS and SCADA systems. Perhaps the state sponsored cyber-attacks cause the most concern as they tend to be at the more sophisticated level of the spectrum and maximize on amount of potential harm that is delivered. There is growing interest in how to protect CNI besides just using traditional methods such as regular patching, Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems (IDPS), up to date compliance policies, etc., and blockchain can be the mechanism that gives another protection layer to protect mission critical data. Blockchain, a decentralized network, offers the features of immutability, non-tampering, security encryption, auditability, and can be a permissioned type of environment where the set of users are invited and not open for all. Blockchain can complement these traditional systems by offering another layer of protection to the sensitive and mission critical data.

AB The systematic integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) into the supply chain to increase operational efficiency and quality has also introduced new complexities to the threat landscape. The myriad of sensors could increase data collection capabilities for businesses to facilitate process automation aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) but without adopting an appropriate Security-by-Design framework, threat detection and response are destined to fail. The emerging concept of Smart Workplace incorporates many CPS (e.g. Robots and Drones) to execute tasks alongside Employees both of which can be exploited as Insider Threats. We introduce and discuss forensic-readiness, liability attribution and the ability to track moving Smart SPS Objects to support modern Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) within a defence-in-depth strategy. We present a framework to facilitate the tracking of object behaviour within Smart Controlled Business Environments (SCBE) to support resilience by enabling proactive insider threat detection. Several components of the framework were piloted in a company to discuss a real-life case study and demonstrate anomaly detection and the emerging of behavioural patterns according to objects' movement with relation to their job role, workspace position and nearest entry or exit. The empirical data was collected from a Bluetooth-based Proximity Monitoring Solution. Furthermore, a key strength of the framework is a federated Blockchain (BC) model to achieve forensic-readiness by establishing a digital Chain-of-Custody (CoC) and a collaborative environment for CPS to qualify as Digital Witnesses (DW) to support post-incident investigations.

DE Blockchain; Consensus Protocol; High Attack tolerant; High Transaction
   Volume; Energy Efficient
AB Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NEO and Ripple have their own advantages and disadvantage. Bitcoin causes massive depletion of energy and computational power. NEO rewards rich miners with more blocks to validate. Ripple can only process a mere 1500 transactions per second [1] with a block time of 3.5 seconds[2]. All these major blockchains have major flaws. My Consensus Protocol "Circle of Trust" overcomes the drawbacks of other consensus protocols such as PoW, PoS and DPos. Apart from this, Circle of Trust also has an architecture capable of scaling the transactions per second, as the network of miners grow, which no other blockchain on the market is capable of doing. This consensus protocol will be able to beat VISAs 56,000 transactions per second[3] while maintaining the sequence of blocks. All this can be done because, the concept of trust score is at the heart of this consensus protocol.

AB This paper discusses the use of Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain, identifying areas where current processes can be enhanced through the use of these new digital technologies while highlighting the issues these early developments present for an industry that is averse to risk, yet open to new technologies that improve patient safety and survival. The report discusses two uses of IoT with Blockchain as examples for the industry with many other possibilities being adoptable in a proposed single architecture that would integrate industry procedures to a common platform. While identifying technological improvements to the industry the paper also identifies the practical aspects of such a development, with varying interests across the sector, restricted funds and advancing computing power all being significant factors in whether and how to invest in such technologies.
   With reference to other industry attempts to make improved decisions from IoT technologies, the necessity for industry representation and leadership is seen as a significant factor in the success of any large-scale industry-wide development of a size where significant industry improvements would be achieved. While small scale isolated projects can assist individual institutions the savings industry-wide from these is likely to be much less significant than a single platform addressing total industry issues, however, the complexity in achieving this is not to be underestimated. A government body or the healthcare industry, is potentially required to coordinate the design and implementation, compiling the scope and design documentation with funding and development/implementation being provided for the industry as a whole.
   The paper concludes that the technologies can offer considerable technical advantages to healthcare but these are in the early stages of development. The opportunities and requirements for healthcare are significant and need early consideration and industry coordination, using existing network developments as a basis for healthcare platform designs and developed specifically to address the needs of the industry.

AB dAppER is to provide an automated quality assurance mechanism for the internal procedures put in place for the production of exam papers and their respective assessment schemes. Higher Education Providers (HEP) in the UK, or for that matter Universities worldwide, have a duty to meet the quality standards and requirements set out in their respective curricula and programme specifications. Such requirements usually include internal moderation of unseen examination papers and independent review by an external examiner to ensure necessary checks have taken place. These checks are likely to be scrutinised during audit trails. Permissioned blockchain facilitates the secure distribution of the exam paper, whilst maintaining an immutable and trusted ledger for audits. The system allows transparency that is ideal for External Examiners and Auditors to view. A prototype was developed using HyperLedger and implemented on three mock exam papers. The results demonstrate that dAppER can be successfully implemented and provide some insights into whether the development of decentralised applications complements quality assurance systems in general.

AB This paper presents a proposal for developing secure social media spaces for groups of people that could be vulnerable to external influences. These could be refuges from war torn or politically unstable countries that could be persecuted by political opponents, or young children that could be targeted online by paedophiles and other online criminals. The system utilizes Block-Chaining technologies to provide the secure environment and Recommender Systems to link members to sub-groups based on their preferable discussion topics and ideas. There are challenges in the proposal as the key issue of trust in the system must be guaranteed by a third party. This organization will need to verify the identity of every subscriber and then create secure user identities / profiles that guarantee the anonymity of members. Block-chaining technologies will also allow the monitoring of user behaviour to ensure the trustworthiness of the environment is maintained. The cost of the system and its operation will be another consideration. The reputation of Block-Chaining technologies due to its links with crypto-currencies should not be considered a negative factor as there are many successful implementations in everyday life

AB There have been significant efforts in the UK to embrace health technology to improve provisions of care. Yet, healthcare offers unique challenges to innovation, particularly with regard to data siloing. Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger technology that decentralises information storage with the potential to improve health outcomes by concurrently optimising data sharing practices and data privacy. In this paper, we explore how blockchain technology may facilitate the handling of health data in the context of regulatory frameworks, patient rights, cybersecurity and provider-centric perspectives. This is essential if this developing technology is to be considered for implementation at scale.

AB Creating fair, transparent and genuinely democratic modes of decentralized decision-making has been a key concern for many developers and users of blockchains. This article evaluates several popular methods of maintaining consensus and achieving decentralized decision-making on blockchain networks in order to assess the extent to which blockchains challenge the norms of the liberal-democratic order. In particular, it compares and contrasts Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanisms, assessing not just how they operate in a technical sense but also (and most important) the political, economic and social dimensions of these different blockchain governance strategies. This comparison highlights efforts by blockchain communities to redefine or push the bounds of democracy, as well as the challenges they have faced in their efforts to create digital democracies that do not reproduce the same economic and social inequalities present in traditional democratic systems.

AB The development of patients' electronic healthcare records has been hampered by bureaucracy and by heavy regulation within the medical field. Medical data recorded in a patient health records is a valuable source of information that can be used by doctors and researchers to improve the quality of healthcare and the quality of life. Medical data should be owned and controlled by the patient instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems that does not support transfer and semantic interoperability between different healthcare providers. Blockchain technology has demonstrated in the financial field that it is possible to create a safe, secure and auditable mechanism by using a decentralized network along with a public ledger. But with the adoption of the newly General Data Protection Regulation, all technological advances discovered by the Blockchain are now blocked. In this paper we present the main aspect of the GDPR and Blockchain technology in healthcare and a way in which this two can work together.

AB Blockchains are gaining a substantial recognition as an alternative to the traditional data storage systems due to their tampering-resistant and decentralized storage, independence from any centralized authority, and low entry barriers for new network participants. Presently blockchains allow users to store transactions and data sets, however, they don't provide an easy way of creating and keeping relationships between data entities. In this paper we demonstrate a solution that helps software developers maintain relationships between inter-related data entities and datasets in a blockchain. Our solution runs over Ethereum's Go implementation. This is the first step towards a database management-like middleware system for blockchains.

DE Blockchain; Education; Systematic review
AB Blockchain technology enables the formation of a distributed record of a digital event in decentralized manner where data and related transactions are not under the control of any third party. This technology was early used for value transfer but now it has vast range of applications in different fields such as healthcare, banking, internet of things and many others. In the field of education, it also provides numerous opportunities for decentralized management of records in educational institutions in an interoperability manner. The main objective of this research is to highlight the existing issues related to the educational institutes and to find suitable blockchain features that could resolve them. We have adopted a systematic literature review approach for the identification and the extraction of relevant information from the shortlisted studies. This study describes existing issues in three aspects physical, digital and financial. The results of the analysis shows that the manipulation risk, difficulty in verification and exchanging record between institutions are the major issues faced by the educational institutions. This study, then explores blockchain features including decentralization, traceability and consensus mechanism that can be used to address the issues related to the educational institution. Finally, due to unique and underlying technology, it has still some technical challenges and boundaries along with immutability feature, disclosure of personal privacy and scalability issue also discussed in this study.

DE Standards; Social web; Decentralization; Blockchain
AB For over a decade, standards bodies like the IETF and W3C have attempted to prevent the centralization of the Web via the use of open standards for 'permission-less innovation.' Yet today, these standards, from OAuth to RSS, seem to have failed to prevent the massive centralization of the Web at the hands of a few major corporations like Google and Facebook. We'll delve deep into the lessons of failed attempts to replace DNS like XRIs, identity systems like OpenID, and metadata formats like the Semantic Web, all of which were re-cuperated by centralized platforms like Facebook as Facebook Connect and the "Like" Button. Learning from the past, a new generation of blockchain standards and governance mechanisms may be our last, best chance to save the Web.

AB Blockchains and the GDPR pursue similar objectives where they seek to grant users greater control over their personal data. While the latter pursues this goal by imposing duties of care to centralized controllers and collectors of data, blockchains go a step beyond by trying to eliminate these stakeholders and the need to trust them. Nevertheless, the rules set out by the GDPR apply whenever personal data are at stake, and various actors of the blockchain ecosystem risk liability for controlling of processing data in violation of privacy requirements. A possible solution is to re-contextualize the concepts of data controlling and responsibility, as framed by the GDPR, in light of blockchains' enhanced individual autonomy. In this paper, we set the framework for a further inquiry on the role of users as both data subjects and data controllers of distributed ledgers.

AB Is a blockchain revolution happening now or has its hype been seriously overstated? In the data-driven world, blockchain technology can potentially bring many benefits to people and organisations that suffer from a lack of information infrastructure or access to reliable integrated data. So, there is no surprise that leading actors of global environmental governance, including the United Nations and the World Bank, have started to support initiatives to develop blockchain platforms. However, the successful implementation of this technology and its ability to contribute to effective environmental policies depend on a range of factors that are often difficult to manage. In this paper, we aim to systematise theoretical and practical approaches to blockchain platforms in environmental management as well as to analyse existing barriers to this adoption. Based on our study, we concluded that the main obstacles preventing a blockchain revolution in global environmental governance are not connected to technological development, but rather to modern information cultures and worldviews.

AB Blockchain is an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed public ledger technology underlying Bitcoin, and has recently attracted intensive attention from governments, financial institutions and high-tech enterprises. It is believed that blockchain can improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance data security, but it is still in the face of serious privacy issues which may hinder the wide application of blockchain. In this paper, We present a practical scheme by adding the Identity-Based encryption system, which effectively improves the data privacy for non-transaction applications. Analyses show that our proposal has a high security level which can prevent both disguise and passive attacks, and is functional, effective and practical in many applications for non-transactional scenarios.

DE Edge Computing; Blockchain; Internet of Things (IoT)
AB As the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and embedded artificial cloud computing develop, cloud computing is encountering growing challenges such as stringent latency requirements, network bandwidth constraints, etc. Edge computing proposes to bring computing and storage closer to user ends (UEs). Furthermore, mobile edge computing (MEC) aims to combine edge computing and cloud computing to offer better latency and user experience. However, cloud computing exists some inherent weakness, such as data loss and leakage, threats to data privacy, etc. We propose a blockchain-based MEC platform, called BlockMEC, that consists of unknown devices to distribute computing, control, storage, and networking functions to the edge of network without involving any central controllers. The survey paper also summarizes typical MEC concepts and makes comparisons between them and BlockMEC.

   Byzantine Fault Tolerance; Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance
AB With the great success of cryptocurrencies, people have paid great attention to blockchain technology and Byzantine fault tolerance(BFT) for consensus. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol (PBFT) proposed by Castro and Liskov in 1999 is recognized as the most classic protocol for solving the Byzantine generals problem, but it still has many fatal disadvantages. Firstly, its communication complexity in the consensus process has reached O(n(2)), so that it can only be applied in a small-scale system. Secondly, it works in a completely enclosed environment, nodes are not allowed to participate or exit the network without restarting the system, making it difficult to get applied in the actual system. In order to solve these problem, this paper proposes the High Performance and Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance, an improved BFT protocol, called HSBFT. In normal case operation, the HSBFT's communication complexity is reduced to O(n), and it also has the ability to be scalable, making it adaptable to more diverse practical scenarios.

DE D2D communication; resource allocation; SCMA; block-chains
AB The device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the promising technologies of the future Internet of Things (IoT), but its security-related issues remain challenging. The block-chain is considered to be a secure and reliable distributed ledger, so we can treat the device user equipment (D-UE) request for the reusing resources of cellular user equipment (CUE) as a transaction and put it into a transaction pool, then package the record into the block-chain. In this paper, we study the D2D communication resource allocation scheme based on sparse code multiple access (SCMA). Firstly, the system's interference model and block-chain-based transaction flow are analyzed. Then we propose the optimization problem so that CUE can get the maximum revenue by sharing its resources to DUE. This problem is NP-hard, so we propose a heuristic algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) programming to solve it. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation of different system parameters.

AB The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.

DE Healthcare; Blockchain; Interoperability; Privacy; unified access
AB The healthcare industry is a complex system of interconnected entities. Each of these entities has disjoint information systems to manage patient data and records. The current IT solutions in healthcare systems have several challenges such as sharing and accessing medical records across several stakeholders while still maintaining security and privacy of these records. This global problem on how to create, maintain, and share sensitive medical records and clinical data among various stakeholders without sacrificing data privacy and integrity is still unresolved. In fact, existing healthcare records are decentralized, disjointed, non-uniform, and fragmented in nature. In this paper, we present a Blockchain-based framework, called DASS-CARE, that supports decentralized, accessible, scalable, and secure access to healthcare services including medical records. Such framework will greatly facilitate the process of real time access and updates without compromising security, integrity and confidentiality of patient data. Our objective is multifold. First, improve the quality of healthcare and lower the cost of delivery. Second, enhance medical records management including electronic health records unification. Finally, provide users with the ability to view their medical records regardless of their history, a task that is difficult to accomplish under the current fragmented systems.

DE Internet of Things; Blockchain; Access control
AB Access control models for the Internet of Things (IoT) proposed in the literature are based on centralized architecture and raise security issues due to the spontaneous and dynamic interaction between IoT devices. In addition to the scalability and lightweight features, the need of secure and distributed access control architecture to overcome the single point failure problem of a centralized entity becomes a big challenge. This can be done through the Blockchain technology which is used recently to provide access control services. Exploiting this technology to manage access IoT devices in term of distribution, heterogeneity, scalability, fault tolerance capability, security and privacy are promising. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing access control models based on Blockchain is presented and discussed with comparison and analysis.

ID ATTACKS; SYSTEM
AB Several IoT applications are tightly dependent on the locations of the devices. However, localization algorithms can be easily compromised by injecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure localization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity. The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of malicious nodes.

AB Electronic transactions with cryptocurrency systems based on blockchain in our days have become very popular due to the good reputation of this technology. However, that good reputation cannot deny the serious anomalies and the risks that can cause these cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose a new model for anomaly detection over bitcoin electronic transactions. We used in our proposal two machine learning algorithms, namely the One Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) algorithm to detect outliers and the K-Means algorithm in order to group the similar outliers with the same type of anomalies. We evaluated our work by generating detection results and we obtained high performance results on accuracy.

AB The ever-growing world of the Internet of Things (IoT) is yet to agree on an effective and practical access control solution. To overcome challenges such as limited resources, or unreliable connectivity, a number of schemes offload heavy computations onto a central entity, thus creating a single point of failure. Our contribution consists in the construction of a distributed attribute-based access control mechanism, relying on the blockchain technology to dynamically manage multi-endorsed attributes and trust anchors. The originality of our proposal is multifold. First, it enables the integration of multiple security domains into a single resilient access control system. Second, its focus on attributes offers flexibility, expressiveness, and user-centricity, accommodating the dynamic addition of subjects. Third, our attribute endorsement is open, scalable, and flexible, enabling multiple administrators without sacrificing ease of management. Finally, the final access control decision is taken by the device and only requires local connection to its gateway.

A distributed access control can overcome the single point failure problem of centralized access models. In this paper, we propose a distributed and trustworthy access control solution for the IoT by applying the smart contract-enabled blockchain.

AB Once a subject is diagnosed with cancer, a patient goes through a series of diagnosis and tests, referred to as after cancer treatment. Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects on regular lifestyles, maintaining quality of life in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes within a home environment, a cancer patient's situation changes abruptly, as the functionality of certain organs deteriorate, which affects their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain and off-chain based framework which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent IoT sensors to capture quality of life information from one's home environment and securely share it with one's community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data - consisting of a user's physiological as well as mental states - can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support. We have also developed Blockchain-based data analytics, which will allow a clinician to visualize the immutable history of the patient's data available from an in-home secure monitoring system for a better understanding of a patient's current or historical states. We further designed a generic oncologist smart contract and digital wallet for different stakeholders to automate the treatment plan of a particular patient. Finally, we will present our current implementation status, which provides significant encouragement for further development.

AB Brain-computer interface can be currently accelerated to develop the exoskeleton for healthy people as well as patients who are unable to move muscles around the world. In this situation, the communication between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and prosthesis discovers the vulnerabilities to taking personal information. However, previous researches only focus on the analysis of attack pattern ratherthan fixing the vulnerability. In order to complement the vulnerability, we propose a blockchain platform in which try to identify the modulated data when server is attacked. Also, we find out potential risks in EEG data with non-blockchain environments after attack in our study. As a result, the proposed system can guarantee the integrity of EEG data by knowing the change of hash, and can prevent attacks such as hijacking, sniffing, and eavesdropping.

AB The automotive industry is re-blooming with recent enhances in technology. Electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles are already attracting attention to the industry and providing momentum for adoption of other emerging technologies. This has its impact on a diverse range of stakeholders from manufacturers to consumers.
   There is a new frontier that can lend its abilities to the experiences built around vehicles and it is the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is an enabler. It can act as a transaction medium between interacting parties. It can also be used as a tamper-free ledger to store a history of transactions. With these two simple abilities, blockchains can enable several applications to make vehicle-related experiences better.
   In this paper, we propose a tamper-free ledger of events as an insurance record of motor vehicles. This insurance record system can include all aspects of insurance transactions. It not only would improve the experience around proving insurance, but also act as evidence in the event of a dispute. This ledger can have extended services around providing a clean driving record. Individual drivers, dealers, insurance companies, lawyers, law enforcement agencies and motor vehicle agencies are all stakeholders of this blockchain based solution.

AB We introduce an improvement fair exchange method called Themis, which does not require Trusted Third Parties. Themis system is implemented based on blockchain, and can provide escrow services for secure exchanging between cryptocurrencies and physical goods. We propose many application scenarios for Themis, such as peer-to-peer escrow payments, exchanges among digital currencies. We implement a test-net for Themis and the experimental results shows that Themis protocol is practical in real-world distributed environment.

AB Blockchain innovations are having a profound effect on the global financial industry, yet little is known about how the emerging technology can potentially disrupt other industries. The supply chain industry represents a prominent and very promising application scenario for blockchain to enable transparency among untrusted stakeholders as well as increased efficiency and traceability throughout production and distribution processes, however there is a lack of empirical research available in that field. The primary purpose of this research is to address that research gap by exploring the application of blockchain technologies in supply chains. First, this research examines recent literature to identify current inefficiencies in existing supply chain information technologies. Secondly, key features of blockchain are identified to provide a clear understanding of the technology. Thirdly, current applications are documented and categorized to identify where blockchain applications can have the most impact on the three flows of the supply chain. The analysis shows most of the process areas in supply chain that blockchain is expected to improve are informational, which given the large amount of interdependencies between flows, has a positive impact on the subsequent financial and material flows. Finally, recommendations for future research are given to address further research questions.

AB Along with the increase in international travel there is a consequential rise in the amount of leftover currency (LFC) or the paper bills/coins that people cannot spend during their international travel. This cash mostly stay in people's pockets and travels back to people's home country. There are ways that LFC can be brought back into the economy such as souvenir shopping at the airports, donations to a charity wending machine or throwing into fountains to wish. However, these means of utilization have various limitations associated with them. Hence, there is a need for a transparent and a more convenient method to spend the LFC. In this work, we implement a system that solves the LFC problem by converting it into a cryptocurrency. The process of conversion requires depositing the LFC at a kiosk. The users can then use an android application to receive the cryptocurrency which they deposit in the foreign country. The amount of cryptocurrency bought by current rate appears in the users' e-wallet. The kiosk backend handles the currency and storage of critical transactions in a blockchain. The proposed system gives a fairly simple solution for a long lasting problem that is only possible because of the blockchain technology.

AB Conventional data storage methods like SQL and NoSQL offer a huge amount of possibilities with one major disadvantage, having to use a centralized authority. This authority may be in the form of a centralized or decentralized master server or a permissioned peer-to-peer setting. This paper looks at different technologies on how to persist data without using a central authority, mainly looking at permissionless peer-to-peer networks, primarily Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and a combination of DLTs with conventional databases. Afterwards it is shown how a system like this might be implemented in two prototypes which are then evaluated against conventional databases.

   State(XGS)
AB Blockchain is a database technology that provides the integrity and trust of the system can't make arbitrary modifications and deletions by being an append-only distributed ledger. That is, the blockchain is not a modification or deletion but a CRAB (Create-Retrieve-Append-Burn) method in which data can be read and written according to a legitimate user's access right(For example, owner private key). However, this can not delete the created data once, which causes problems such as privacy breach. In this paper, we propose an on-off block chained Hybrid Blockchain system to separate the data and save the connection history to the blockchain. In addition, the state is changed to the distributed database separately from the ledger record, and the state is changed by generating the arbitrary injection in the XOR form, so that the history of modification / deletion of the Off Blockchain can be efficiently retrieved.

DE Distributed Ledger Technologies; Blockchain; Consensus; Byzantine Fault
   Tolerance; DLT Platform; Blockchain Use Cases
AB A key issue for Distributed Ledger Technologies is how to agree on any changes to the Ledger; the way to reach such an agreement is known as consensus protocol. There are currently many platforms and implementations of DLTs, each offering a more or less effective way to reach consensus. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to know which consensus mechanism is most appropriate for a given use case. We propose in this short paper a draft methodology to choose between a lottery-based consensus and a voting-based consensus. We take in account several indicators, both related to the requirements of the use case in question, but also to its position relatively to the tradeoff "Security - Scalability - Decentralization".

So far, we have found that the overall trust-related requirements engineering knowledge is far from what is needed for successful engineering of various trust-related challenges in blockchain systems. We have identified an urgent need and challenge to revisit requirements engineering models to effectively include trust requirements; and to produce a trust engineering taxonomy, models, and techniques for achieving and fulfilling blockchain system trust requirements and goals.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Data Dissemination is the distribution of data/statistics to the end users. With the adoption of Internet of Drones (IoD) environment for data dissemination, an efficient scheme is proposed which provides data integrity, identity anonymity, authentication, authorization, accountability (AAA) to the system model. We propose a system model having Ethereum based public blockchain distributed network in order to secure drone communication for the data collection and transmission. The proposed model provides secure communication between the drones and the users in a decentralized way. In this paper, blockchain technology is used for the storage of collected data from the drones and update the information into the distributed ledgers to reduce the burden of drones. It also provides integrity, authentication, and authorization to the collected data by the drones in the system model. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this paper is threefold. First, we select a forger node from the number of drones. Second, we create blocks and validate their processes. Third, we provide secure data dissemination by applying Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Afterward, we evaluate the security of the presented system model compared against the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art in terms of communication time/cost. The results confirm that our system model is reliable and scalable for data dissemination in the IoD environment.

DE Audit Trails; Blockchain; eGovernment
AB Blockchain-based audit trails provide a consensus-driven and tamper-proof trail of system events that are helpful in creating provenance in enterprise solutions. However, taking into account the transaction bulk generated by these applications and the throughput limitations of existing blockchains, a single ledger for record keeping can be inefficient and costly. To that end, we see an imperative need for a new blockchain design that is capable of addressing current challenges, without compromising security and provenance. Hence, we propose Block Trail, a scalable and efficient blockchain solution for auditing applications. BlockTrail fragments the legacy blockchain systems into layers of co-dependent hierarchies, thereby reducing the time and space complexity, and increasing the throughput. BlockTrail is prototyped on "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (PBFT) protocol with a custom-built blockchain. Experiments with BlockTrail show that compared to the conventional schemes, BlockTrail is more efficient, and has less storage footprint.

DE IIoT; supply chain; blockchain; fairness
AB Integrating the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) into supply chain management enables flexible and efficient on-demand exchange of goods between merchants and suppliers. However, realizing a fair and transparent supply chain system remains a very challenging issue due to the lack of mutual trust among the suppliers and merchants. Furthermore, the current system often lacks the ability to transmit trade information to all participants in a timely manner, which is the most important element in supply chain management for the effective supply of goods between suppliers and the merchants. This paper presents a blockchain-based supply chain management system in the IIoT. The proposed system takes advantage of blockchain technology in terms of its transparency and tamper-proof nature to support fair goods exchange between merchants and suppliers. Additionally, the decentralization and pseudonymity property will play a significant role in preserving the privacy of participants in the blockchain. In particular, fairness in the IIoT is first defined. Then, a design for a smart contract for fair goods exchange is presented to prevent malicious behavior through imposing penalties. The proposed system was prototyped on Ethereum and experiments were conducted to demonstrate its feasibility.

AB This paper studies a fundamental problem regarding the security of blockchain on how the existence of multiple misbehaving pools influences the profitability of selfish mining. Each selfish miner maintains a private chain and makes it public opportunistically for the purpose of acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hashrate. We establish a novel Markov chain model to characterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The minimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being profitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the symmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrate puts forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable delay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the mining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.

AB The emerging blockchain technology provides a new paradigm for maintaining data integrity and unforgeability in a distributed manner. However conventional public blockchain systems suffer large consensus latency thus cannot be well applied to Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the high mobility of vehicles and low latency requirement. In addition, not all messages in IoV should be stored in a global ledger. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Blockchain (HB) which divides the system into two layers and each layer maintains an exclusive ledger. Sensing informal' of vehicles are recorded in differnet layer according to its influence scope. Furthermore, based on the transactions recorded in the hierarchical blockchain, we design the proactive file duplicate caching scheme considering not only popularities but influence scopes for the enhancement of overall system performance. Simulation results shows the superiority of the proposed architecture compared with conventional vehicular systems, in terms of failure rate, latency and system utility.

AB Electronic medical records (EMRs) are highly sensitive information shared among peers to keep up-to-date patient history. Providing security, privacy, and availability to these sensitive data is a challenge because, typically, after data publication the patient loses control over them. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach to secure EMR for healthcare applications, where access control is patient-centric. Our proposal keeps encrypted EMRs in the blockchain, and the patient shares the decryption key only with healthcare professionals in which he/she trusts. Blockchain allows untrusted node, in a distributed peer-to-peer network to correctly and verifiably interact with each other, without any reliable intermediary. We investigate the scalability of our approach through simulations. Results show that it scales well since increasing the number of nodes in the network implies a linear increase in the size of the stored chain. Results also reveal that the time for inserting a new EMR in the blockchain remains low even when the number of nodes in the network increases.

AB In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency aware architecture of caching the necessary production messages and the transaction process to support a readable and tamper proof internet of things (IoT). To achieve this, blockchain can provide a reliable distributed storage of the messages, because any changes of the cached messages will break the structure of the blockchain. Specifically, we assume that the access points belonging to different telecom operators collect the messages in the IoT network, wherein multiple servers used for either caching or computing are placed at each access point. We define that the caching servers can be divided into the data loading caches for caching the received wireless IoT data and the data transmission caches for transmitting the IoT data into the blockchain based cloud caching servers. The blocks generated in the data loading caches at each access point will be written into the blockchain based on both the proof-of-work and the capacity of the data loading caches at each access point. Then, we formulate the optimization problem maximizing the system energy efficiency by optimizing the allocation of cache, computation and communication resources by a geometric programming model. By the CVX tool in matlab software, the geometric programming model can be solved effectively. We study the impact of different parameters involved in the blockchain on the system performance, and verify the effectiveness of our proposed energy efficiency aware optimization mechanism in the blockchain based IoT.

DE Named Data Networking (NDN); blockchain; compatibility; broadcasting;
   subscription-push approach
AB Blockchain can be used to ensure trust in a decentralized environment in which no trusted authority is available. Its original idea is to collect transactions in a block, and to chain the blocks together in such a way that attackers cannot forge the chain if the majority of the network is honest. Since its creation in 2008, blockchain technology has been used broadly in Internet to support decentralized payments, cloud computing, publishing, etc. This work focuses on public permissionless blockchain which neither guards against bad actors nor enforces access control. Named data networking (NDN) uses name-based routing and in-networking caching to support efficient content delivery, making it a promising future Internet architecture as well as a great network technology which can improve blockchain data delivery. Therefore, it is a very necessary task to enable deployment of blockchain applications over NDN. However, NDN is not immediately compatible with typical blockchain, since (permissionless) blockchain applications usually require broadcasting transactions and blocks in real time, which is not supported by the "pull" design of NDN.
   In this work, we propose BoNDN which enables blockchain applications over NDN. Unlike previous work, BoNDN follows the core design of NDN. We treat each type of blockchain data needed to be broadcast individually. Specifically, we rely on Interest broadcasting to support real-time broadcasting of blockchain transactions, which is small in size and can be brought by an Interest packet. In addition, we propose a subscription-push approach to support broadcasting of blockchain blocks, in which each miner performs subscription, and once a block is generated, the subscribed miner will receive the block.

AB Outsourcing storage and computation to clouds is popular but also raises security concerns. Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for verification of encrypted data.

AB The burgeoning vehicular networks generate a huge amount of sensing data. Data sharing among vehicles enables a number of valuable vehicular applications to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. To ensure security and traceability of data sharing, an efficient Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm is utilized to establish Blockchain-Enabled VEhicular Networks (BEVENs). Miners in DPoS include active miners and standby miners. The active miners are responsible for block generation and block verification. However, due to the limited number of active miners in DPoS, the compromised active miners may collude with each other to generate maliciously manipulated results of block verification. To prevent the internal collusion among the active miners, a newly generated block can be further verified and audited by the standby miners. To incentivize the participation of the miners in block verification, we adopt the contract theory to model the interactions between active miners and standby miners, where both block verification security and delay are taken into consideration. Numerical results demonstrate the security and efficiency of our schemes for data sharing in BEVENs.

ID MODEL
AB The rapid development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) necessitates a secure and reliable infrastructure to store and share the massive data. Blockchain, a distributed and immutable ledger, is widely considered as a promising solution to ensure data security and privacy for IoV. To deal with the massive IoV data, the scalability of blockchain becomes a critical issue, which should maximize transactional throughput as well as handling the dynamics of IoV scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IoV, where transactional throughput is maximized while guaranteeing the decentralization, latency and security of the underlying blockchain system. In this framework, we first carry out the performance analysis for blockchain systems from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency and security. Further, DRL technique is adopted to select block producers and adjust block size and block interval to adapt to the dynamics of IoV scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the throughput of blockchain-enabled IoV systems without affecting other properties.

AB In this work we provide comprehensive analytical model for Bitcoin distribution network. We apply Jackson network model on the whole Bitcoin network where individual nodes operate as priority M/G/1 queuing systems. Data arrival process to the nodes is modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process in which the data arrival rates to the nodes are derived from the analytical model of gossip data delivery protocol. This model considers random probability distribution of node connectivity. Performance results include network distribution time for blocks, node response time for blocks, and populations of data distribution algorithms as functions on network size. Usefulness of this model is demonstrated by efficiently computing the forking probability for the Bitcoin blockchain.

ID MODEL
AB With the development of decentralized consensus protocols, permissionless blockchains have been envisioned as a promising enabler for the general-purpose transaction-driven, autonomous systems. However, most of the prevalent blockchain networks are built upon the consensus protocols under the crypto-puzzle framework known as proof-of-work. Such protocols face the inherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck, as the networks achieve the decentralized consensus for transaction confirmation at the cost of very high latency. In this paper, we study the problem of consensus formation in a system of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus. Specifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of processors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for accelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to impose different levels of processing fees and to have different transaction-generating rate, we aim to simulate the multi-service provision eco-systems based on blockchains in real world. We focus on the dynamics of blockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus processors. Hence, we model the evolution of blockchain selection by the individual processors as an evolutionary game. Both the theoretical and the numerical analysis are provided regarding the evolutionary equilibria and the stability of the processors' strategies in a general case.

DE blockchain; access control; authorization
AB The specification and enforcement of network-wide policies in a single administrative domain is common in today's networks and considered as already resolved. However, this is not the case for multi-administrative domains, e.g. among different enterprises. In such situation, new problems arise that challenge classical solutions such as PKIs, which suffer from scalability and granularity concerns. In this paper, we present an extension to Group-Based Policy -a widely used network policy languagefor the aforementioned scenario. To do so, we take advantage of a permissioned blockchain implementation (Hyperledger Fabric) to distribute access control policies in a secure and auditable manner, preserving at the same time the independence of each organization. Network administrators specify polices that are rendered into blockchain transactions. A LISP control plane (RFC 6830) allows routers performing the access control to query the blockchain for authorizations. We have implemented an end-to-end experimental prototype and evaluated it in terms of scalability and network latency.

AB This paper proposes a new device-to-device edge computing and networks (D2D-ECN) framework which facilitates low-latency execution of real-time Internet-of Things applications through computation offloading with minimal overhead. Our framework accounts for key challenges of D2D-ECN in terms of the efficiency of the resource management and the resulting security concerns caused by lacking trustworthy between task owners and resource providers. In particular, we propose to use a blockchain-empowered framework for implementing resource trading and task assigment as the smart contracts. However, the existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) is impractical for the resource-constrained toT devices due to high computational complexity of the mining process. Thus, we present a reputation-based consensus mechanism called proof-of-reputation (PoR), where the device with the highest reputation score is responsible for packaging the resource transactions and reputation records in the blockchain. Furthermore, we evaluate the reputation score of each device according to the current computation performance and history reputation. Security, feasibility analysis and numerical results show that our proposed computation offloading scheme can be deployed in the decentralized D2D-ECN system safely and effectively.

AB The proliferation of renewable energy systems and high-capacity batteries has enabled customers to trade their excess energy on the market in a peer-to-peer manner through the smart grid. At the same time, electric vehicles (EVs) are enjoying widespread acceptance, leading to a higher demand for charging stations. In this paper, we propose a system where energy traders and EV owners collectively work to satisfy the energy demands of EVs. Specifically, energy traders make bids to EV owners who, in turn, reserve their preferred charging station for a specific period of time. To protect the privacy of EV owners, we also introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link individual owners to specific charging locations. Finally, to guarantee the security and transparency of the entire system, we store all transactions on a consortium blockchain that is managed by the energy traders and the financial institutions that support the anonymous payment system. Our experimental results indicate that the overhead of the cryptographic operations involved in the major transactions is low, in terms of both computational and communication cost.

AB Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Function Chaining (SFC) offer flexible end-to-end services that deploy virtual network functions in clouds of competing providers. Orchestration of virtual network functions occurs in a distributed and trustless environment that must tolerate byzantine failures and collusion attacks. This paper proposes BSec-NFVO, a blockchain-based system that secures orchestration operations in virtualized networks, ensuring auditability, non-repudiation and integrity. We propose an NFV-tailored blockchain and a transaction model. BSec-NFVO provides a modular architecture to secure orchestration in a simple and agile way. We develop a prototype of BSec-NFVO for the Open Platform for Network Function Virtualization (OPNFV) with an adaptation of the normal-case of a collusion-resistant consensus protocol. The results show BSec-NFVO incurs low overhead to the cloud orchestrator and presents stable performance as the number of consensus participants increases.

DE Ultra-dense wireless networks; mobile edge computing; computation
   offloading; blockchain
AB The past few years have witnessed the explosive growth of mobile user equipment (UEs) and the popularity of computation-intensive applications, leading to a mobile edge computing paradigm for Ultra-dense wireless networks (UDNs). Since numerous UEs need to offload a large amount of computation tasks to edge servers/UEs, it is very challenging to coordinate computation offloading among UEs and edge servers in UDNs. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized computation offloading coordination platform that is based on the blockchain. Specifically, we first establish a blockchain platform for announcing computation offloading requests and coordinate computation offloading among UEs and edge servers. Then, we develop a modified GS-based user matching algorithm to find the matching relationship between offloading requester's computation tasks and the edge server/UEs. In particular, user matching is based on task execution time and energy consumption. We conduct simulations and provide extensive simulation results to show the significant performance improvement achieved by the proposed offloading scheme.

DE Blockchains; multi-domain IoT; Sharding Protocol; Two Times Consensus
AB Internet of Things (IoT), an significant support for strategic emerging industries, is re-building industrial systems, such as transportation, healthcare and energy, while a number of new features and requirements like data cross-industry sharding appear in recent years. The emerging Blockchain technology has provided a promising opportunity to break information island and single-domain management in multi-domain IoT systems by leveraging distributed storage. On the other hand, the transaction consensus throughput in the mainstream blockchain systems, such as Ethereum and Fabric, is far from meeting the demand for massive data storage in time in multi-domain IoT systems. In this paper, we design a sharding protocol called MDIoTSP. The protocol first partitions the overall blockchains into many small shards, each of which generally recognized as a micro-blockchain according to the multiple domains, and then make the final consensus by merging the hash digests of the sub-blocks which generated from the shards for the multi-domain IoT blockchains ecosystem specifically. We also develop MicrothingsChains to run MDIoTSP in multi-domain IoT blockchains to prove our assumption that MDIoTSP scales up the transaction consensus throughput near linearly with the number of shards.

DE Connected vehicles; Vehicle data security; Blockchain
AB Nowadays, the automobile industry is integrating many new features into vehicles. To provide these features, various electronic systems are being added. These systems are coordinated by different ECUs (Electronic Control Unit). Vehicle ECUs are internally connected through multiple communication buses. Any ECU connected to the bus can read or send data to other ECUs. As a result, if an adversary can compromise one of the ECUs, then the adversary will be able to access and exploit the data of other important ECUs. Moreover, an adversary can modify the stored data of an important ECU, if it is compromised. To solve these problems, we propose the use of symmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve-based Public Key Encryption (PKE) for ensuring confidentiality and the use of digital signature for ensuring integrity and authenticity. In addition, we propose the adoption of an identity-based access control to control the communication permissions. We also introduce a Blockchain-inspired mechanism to secure data stored in ECUs. Finally, we integrate a watcher to monitor the stored data and report if it is modified. We implement our concept using the ARM architecture-based Raspberry Pi Board and show that our approach can improve security in ECU communications and the watcher reports when an ECU data is modified.

AB It is common to certify when a file was created in digital investigations, e.g., determining first inventors for patentable ideas in intellectual property systems to resolve disputes. Secure time-stamping schemes can be derived from blockchain-based storage to protect files from backdating/forward-dating, where a file is integrated into a transaction on a blockchain and the timestamp of the corresponding block reflects the latest time the file was created. Nevertheless, blocks' timestamps in blockchains suffer from time errors, which causes the inaccuracy of files' timestamps. In this paper, we propose an accurate blockchain-based time-stamping scheme called Chronos. In Chronos, when a file is created, the file and a sufficient number of successive blocks that are latest confirmed on blockchain are integrated into a transaction. Due to chain quality, it is computationally infeasible to pre-compute these blocks. The time when the last block was chained to the blockchain serves as the earliest creation time of the file. The time when the block including the transaction was chained indicates the latest creation time of the file. Therefore, Chronos makes the file's creation time corresponding to this time interval. Based on chain growth, Chronos derives the time when these two blocks were chained from their heights on the blockchain, which ensures the accuracy of the file's timestamp. The security and performance of Chronos are demonstrated by a comprehensive evaluation.

DE Cryptocurrency; payment channel network; routing; blockchain
AB The past several years have witnessed an explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even the leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve the cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers the off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of payment routing in PCNs from an optimization perspective, which is to minimize the transaction fee of a payment path, subject to the timeliness and feasibility constraints. We present an optimal distributed algorithm CheaPay for this problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CheaPay significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of the success ratio and the average accepted value.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence and self-driving, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) has become an irreplaceable part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, the traditional network of the ground cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the transmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues such as identity authentication, privacy protection and data security. This paper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and privacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme focuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and authenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block are implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm, instead of the consensus. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the security of this scheme. Afterward, the experimental results reveal the delay brought by the scheme using the simulation of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Veins.

AB The future deployment of vehicular networks for road transportation (the so called Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) in Europe or Connected Vehicles program in USA) should be based on the secure exchange of messages among the vehicles and the infrastructure communication nodes. Deployment projects in various parts of the world are setting up Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to support the security and privacy aspects on vehicular communications. While the use of PKI is a known technology to build a security framework for C-ITS and Connected Vehicles deployments and it will provide the basic needed services for integrity and authentication, research communities around the world are exploring extensions of these frameworks to implement specific functions like misbehavior detection and revocation. In addition, new techniques to mitigate privacy risks in vehicular networks are explored. In this paper, we address these aspects by proposing the use of blockchain in combination with a zone keys concept where the authorization certificates produced by the PKI are provided to the vehicles only if specific conditions stored in the blockchain are valid. We show how the concepts described in this paper can enhance the PKI-based frameworks through an efficient revocation mechanism, and mitigating privacy risks as well.

AB The Internet of Thing (IoT) is generating an unprecedented volume of data, facilitating the rise of the Data Economy. Under this ecosystem, the IoT data marketplace (IDM) provides an online platform for IoT data trading. Most current IDM solutions are centralized, serving as an intermediary between the data provider and consumer. They support selling and buying data collections (e.g. pre-collected data sets and data streams). However, as these data collections are historically collected without having any priory requirements and preferences given by the data consumer, it is very likely that most of these data collections cannot fulfill data consumer requirements. Redundancy, poor data quality, inaccuracy and limited financial incentives are common problems for existing IDMs, thereby making them financially ineffective. Due to the temporal nature of IoT data, the issue of pre-collection becomes even more critical as it is not trivial to re-collect data from the past.
   This paper presents a novel framework with a new on-demand market model, namely Decentralized IoT Collectability Data Marketplace (DCDM) model. Difference from the conventional IDM models where merely data collections are considered as a commodity, our model also involves operational factors such as data provider availability, operationality, contextual and geographical location etc. This empowers our framework to trade not only the dataset but rather an ability of the data provider to fulfill the collection task. Our game-changing approach is realized using a combination of Blockchain and Crowdsensing techniques. We first explore the concept of "Data Collectability" for IDM, then build a model to deploy our approach on IoT context. Furthermore, we identify potential applications and open research challenges.

AB Internet of Thing devices (IoT devices) are often constrained in terms of computing, memory, storage, power, and network resources. This makes them ill-suited to operate as first-class citizens on a blockchain, such as Ethereum, preventing the IoT devices from attaining the security guarantees that are available to better resourced nodes that are able to operate as full, validating nodes on the blockchain. IoT devices may use so-called light protocols to interact with the blockchain with minimal resource requirements, but these protocols provide only probabilistic security guarantees. In this position paper, we propose a new mechanism where an operator of IoT devices is able to send a "ground truth state" to the devices via a new mechanism, which we call "decentralized beacons", enabling them to gain full security guarantees of the blockchain state.

AB Blockchains are emerging technologies that propose new business models and value propositions. Besides their application for cryptocurrency purposes, as distributed ledgers of transactions, they enable new ways to provision trusted information in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we present our product tagging solution designed to help Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) protect their brands against counterfeit products and parallel markets, as well as to enhance UX (User Experience) and promote the brand and product.
   Our solution combines the use of DLT to assure, in a verifiable and permanent way, the trustworthiness and confidentiality of the information associated to the goods and the innovative CP-ABE encryption technique to differentiate accessibility to the product's information.

AB We consider IoT resources with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and propose a model to provide trusted resource access that is linked to blockchain payments, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the IoT data. The model is built on the widely used OAuth 2.0 open authorization framework, which provides delegated authorization for IoT resources. We utilize hash-lock and time-lock mechanisms to cryptographically link trusted resource access, provided by the IoT resource's TEE, to authorization grants and blockchain payments. The model is implemented in the OP-TEE open source port for the Raspberry Pi that uses ARM's TrustZone and is evaluated on the Rinkeby public Ethereum testnet.

AB Crowdsensing, driven by the proliferation of sensorrich mobile devices, has emerged as a promising data sensing and aggregation paradigm. Despite useful, traditional crowdsensing systems typically rely on a centralized third-party platform for data collection and processing, which leads to concerns like single point of failure and lack of operation transparency. Such centralization hinders the wide adoption of crowdsensing by wary participants. We therefore explore an alternative design space of building crowdsensing systems atop the emerging decentralized blockchain technology. While enjoying the benefits brought by the public blockchain, we endeavor to achieve a consolidated set of desirable security properties with a proper choreography of latest techniques and our customized designs. We allow data providers to safely contribute data to the transparent blockchain with the confidentiality guarantee on individual data and differential privacy on the aggregation result. Meanwhile, we ensure the service correctness of data aggregation and sanitization by delicately employing hardware-assisted transparent enclave. Furthermore, we maintain the robustness of our system against faulty data providers that submit invalid data, with a customized zero-knowledge range proof scheme. The experiment results demonstrate the high efficiency of our designs on both mobile client and SGX-enabled server, as well as reasonable on-chain monetary cost of running our task contract on Ethereum.

Technologies such as Big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, 3D promise to have a profoundly disruptive effect on the industry, business models, governance models and on the way we interact with each other in society. These unprecedented speed, scale and scope of change can provoke inequalities favoring world's richest people become wealthier than ever and a social shock where people lose their old references and competences. Which influence the globalization, circular economy, sharing economy and climate change will have on this digital transformation - How they will shape it? (1) Left this transformation unmanaged, the technologies will shape us and in the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, this can be very dangerous - How we can counteract it? (2) Norms and rules are needed on different domains and levels, strategies to respond to technologies dark side and risks, leaders must be more conscious of their acts and consequences on the environment and social stability - Can these measures help to achieve sustainable development? (3) The changes provoked by this digital transformation will affect governments, industry, and society as a whole - How governments shall design their e-Government and Smart Cities strategies to be better prepared? (4) How industry shall design its Industry 4.0 strategy to be better prepared? (5)

ID MOTIVATION
AB People will respond to incentives, so how to use reasonable and effective incentives to continuously encourage open source project participants, inspire their enthusiasm and development potential, is particularly important. The block chain open source community typically consists of project leaders, developers, users, and investors. The original intention of block chain tokens is to stimulate the ecosystem, and the incentive mechanism for tokens is effective in providing funds and generating incentives for project development. But the token incentive mechanism also has limitations. After the upsurge of block chain project creation and investment, it is necessary for project participants to raise their understanding of tokens, promote the forthcoming block chain open source projects to design tokens distribution scheme more carefully, trigger industry self-regulation, ensure fair distribution and practical application, and return to the original intention of issuing block chain tokens.

AB In the last decade, we have witnessed the emergence of a new socioeconomic paradigm related to Internet-based virtual communities that promote practices of sharing the use or consumption of products and services: the collaborative economy. Despite growing research on the most diverse areas of the collaborative economy, research on the integration of blockchain systems into collaborative economy organizations is still rather limited. By the present investigation, purely explanatory and based on a comparative and interpretive case study, we intend to verify the susceptibility of the blockchain systems to foster the emergence of new business models. Due to the small number of organizations in the collaborative economy currently operating with blockchain-based business models, it will be important in future investigations to identify and study the influence of these systems on the business models of other organizations, in particular whether their adoption represents a source of competitive advantage.

AB This article describes an environment for knowledge acquisition, learning, use and collaboration inter-agents over Internet Infrastructure. Four agent types previously used in a applied fourtier model, such as the use case on the Internet Routing Registry. This model, which can be implemented in each Autonomous System domain of the Internet infrastructure, is integrated into an environment (a) capturing information from unstructured databases, (b) creating and updating training bases appropriate to machine learning algorithms and (c) creating and feeding of a knowledge base. Such resources become readily available to agents in each domain and to agents in all other domains with the aim of making them autonomous. The agents collaborate and interact with each other, through individual blockchain structures that also take care of operational security and integration aspects. In addition, a testbed to validate the entire model, including the functionalities of the agents, is also proposed and characterized.

AB The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network composed of several devices (things) connected to the Internet and to each other. IoT services are increasingly growing and are allowing companies to deploy scalable solutions with reduced costs and instantaneous data access. These solutions require seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self- maintenance. Such requirements can be given to a company's IoT solution by applying blockchain technology. This paper analyzes the blockchain technology and the advantages and challenges behind its implementation in an IoT environment. A blockchain in IoT scenario was developed to evaluate the performance of different cryptographic hash functions in the IoT device RaspberryPi. Conclusions were drawn when it comes to the viability of some hash functions mainly based on the low resource characteristic shared by the IoT devices, which compromises the performance of the hash function.

AB This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy and security enhancement of power trading in the networked microgrids (MGs) based on the blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) approach. Utilizing the blockchain-enabled IoT technology in the power trading of the network MGs can potentially lead to some significant advantages such as fewer system risks, mitigate financial fraud, and less the operational cost. A newly stochastic framework based on the unscented transform (UT) is employed to model the uncertainties of renewable energy resources and hourly load demand. Consequently, the proposed framework is tested on the network MG containing residential MG (as a non-crucial load), commercial MG (as an intermediate level load), and hospital MG (as a crucial load), to validate the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed technique.

AB Blockchain startups are basing their business models on disrupting the centralized way of data storage by highlighting the value of data to the public. A distributed approach to storing data is the safer way to prevent attacks is what is being evangelized. GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) have monopolized data, therefore bringing in the most revenue whilst depriving the data generators of any form of compensation. In our work, we propose a platform where a user can store his/her own personal data. Here, we present to the user the right to decide what happens to their data. These decisions include selling, renting, and deleting data. The deletion of data undermines the fundamentals the blockchain is built on (data immutability). We address the issues of personal data sharing and how a user's right to delete his/her data can be enforced in a blockchain based network such as ours.

AB The advent of blockchain technology has been set to revolutionize the real estate industry, and the potential changes are already taking its shape. The real estate industry is one among the top global sectors that is driving the economic growth of any country. The growth of this industry is well complemented by the growth of the corporate environment, demand for office space, industrial plots, urban housing accommodations, agricultural lands, etc. However, the existing world of real estate is complicated with the lack of transparency in its transactions such as leasing, purchasing, and sales and fails to attain the level of confidentiality and authenticity of operational data. Several aspects of its operations such as property sale prices, sale history, lease rental rates, market valuation, and so on expect greater demand for transparency, data integrity, and security-a trusted environment. As a result, propertyrelated information can be made available as digitized information and hosted as decentralized database of records on distributed systems with lesser incidence of fraud and inaccuracies. The possibilities of mutual delusion and concealment during the sale, rental, and lease processes can be eliminated, thus achieving digitization of real estate ownership. Everything from making real estate investment decisions to choosing investment properties, blockchain can become a common practice by incorporating its wide benefits. This paper aims at revamping the tedious, paper-based, time-consuming system of ownership and renting into a next-generation digitized system based on blockchain technology.

AB The Internet of Things is evolving as a complete matured technology to be used in all the Smart applications and it establishes itself in the future generations of internet. As like Internet of Things, Blockchain is the blooming technology in which each node involved in the blockchain contains the distributed ledger which enhances the security and data transparency. Illegal users are not able to perform any fault transaction in the blockchain network due to its ability of performing smart contract and consensus. The Internet of Things can be merged with the blockchain to improve the performance of the application in real time. However, managing the devices connected to the sensors in IoT environment and mining the block chain remains the technical challenge forever. With this background, we make an attempt to survey the core details of blockchain technology and its features. In this paper, we have proposed design architecture by merging IoT and BlockChain for Smart Agriculture and ended up with some new architectural framework.

AB Over the past few decades, the automation of inter-organizational processes has been the focus of several research efforts that have produced a broad spectrum of design methods and technologies. Recently, some experiments have shown how in principle a Decentralized Autonomous Process-Aware Information System (DAIS) can be implemented by means of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts (BSCs). In this paper, we cast a shadow on this novel approach by arguing that such kind of contracts cannot be considered an optimal abstraction to specify inter-organizational process models. We base our analysis on contractual incompleteness, a pivotal concept in widely accepted economic theories. We identify the main weakness in the conflict between the immutability-by-default of the BSCs and the nature of inter-organizational processes. As a result of this analysis, we introduce the concept of enforceable business process that is more in line with the original idea of smart contract and extends it to better match the essential requirements of a DAIS.

AB A blockchain is a tamper-proof distributed transaction registry; first popularized by Bitcoin [1], it has now been extended to support storage of arbitrary state and computations in-ledger. Ethereum [2] and its smart contract model have proven to be a very popular choice for this task, routinely managing assets valued in the billions. However, development of such contracts has been anything but easy. While formally specified, the Ethereum execution platform is based on a low-level machine, quite similar to assembly; semantics for contract operations such as call are quite complex, and the need for resource management creates unanticipated modes of failure. The dominant day-to-day programming platform for Ethereum is Solidity [3], an Object-Oriented language that identifies contracts with objects. While reasoning about Solidity programs is much easier than for their bytecode counterparts, it is not extent of challenges either, and moreover, Solidity lacks a source-level semantics, which forces developers to reason over output bytecode again. In this short paper we explore the main barriers to lift in order to achieve a principled compilation strategy for Solidity. We will review the standard concepts on verified and secure compilation, and frame them in the context of the Ethereum platform.

AB Blockchains are one of the most promising technologies in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT). At the same time, healthcare monitoring is one of IoT applications where many devices are connected, and collect data that need to be stored in a highly secure way. In this context, we focus on IoT-Blockchain architectures for healthcare monitoring applications. We start our study by exploring both IoT and blockchain technologies and identify how Fabric Hyperledger is a blockchain framework that fits our application needs. In this paper, we propose a security architecture based on this framework. We validate our approach first at a design level through concrete examples, then by showing some implemented functionalities.

DE Blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric; Academic Record Verification
AB While academic institutions maintain records such as transcripts and certificates, they are often requested to share these records with other institutions at the request of students for credit transfer, or prerequisites for acceptance into new academic programs. While the transfer of academic records is a regular daily activity for the institutions, there is often significant overhead involved as the process of transfer and verification is extremely manual. The need for an automated end-to-end solution for the transfer and verification of academic records between institutions is on the edge to reduce wait times for students to transfer their records, as well as to provide a reliable verification method to avoid academic fraud. This paper presents a permissioned blockchain-based system to allow institutions to securely and dependably transfer and verify academic records at the student request. Permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger, provide a more scalable and cost-effective and private solution for enterprise applications. Our solution is comprised of a web interface for enrolling and requesting the transfer, with a backend using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer to retain the hash of the records on the blockchain for verification.

DE analysis; deployment code; exploit; Ethereum; smart contract
AB Ethereum is still the most prominent platform for smart contracts. For the deployment of contracts on its blockchain, the so-called deployment code is executed by Ethereum's virtual machine. As it turns out, deployment code can do a lot more than merely deploying a contract.
   This paper identifies less-anticipated uses of contract deployment in Ethereum by analyzing the available blockchain data. In particular, we analyze the specifics of deployment code used beyond actually deploying a contract in a quantitative and qualitative manner. To this end, we identify code patterns in deployment code by distilling recurring code skeletons from all external transactions and internal messages that contain deployment code. Tracking the use of these patterns reveals a set of vulnerabilities in contracts targeted by skillfully crafted deployment code. We summarize the encountered exploitative cases of collateral use of deployment code and report respective quantities. Example scenarios illustrate the recent usage.
   Collateral use of deployment code starts to appear in the middle of 2018 and becomes dominant among contract creations in autumn of 2018. We intend to raise awareness about the less obvious uses of deployment code and its potential security issues.

AB Ideal RFID systems used in product lifecycle should satisfy high confidentiality, anonymity, integrity and high availability. However, collection and distribution of RFID data are subject to various security concerns. RFID middleware systems are likely to suffer from parameter manipulation and eavesdropping, raising privacy concerns. Most recent works focus on access control schemes with models based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). These schemes, to enhance the security and privacy, are based on centralized models. In this paper, we present an ABAC model using chaincode in RFID systems. Our ABAC system is based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain, which is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains. Our ABAC model uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the ABAC model in order to ensure the security of RFID systems. It should also be noted that the RFID system presented is based on the EPCGlobal standard.

AB The aim of this research is to propose a new blockchain network model that facilitates the secure dissemination of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data. The primary motivations for this study are based around the recent changes to information security legislation in the European Union and the challenges that Computer Security and Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) face when trying to share actionable and highly sensitive data within systems where participants do not always share the same interests or motivations. We discuss the common problems within the domain of CTI sharing and we propose a new model, that leverages the security properties of blockchain. Our model provides a more effective and efficient framework for a CTI sharing network that has the potential to overcome the trust barriers and data privacy issues inherent in this domain. We implemented a testbed using Hyperledger Fabric and the STIX 2.0 protocol and validated the efficacy of the segmentation, implemented using smart contracts and Fabric channels.

AB The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for an increasing number of blockchain systems, each having different characteristics. The need for distributed applications that span across multiple blockchain systems is increasing. However, it is currently not possible to write a single-description smart contract which can be compiled to span across multiple blockchain systems.
   In this paper we present PORTHOS, a macroprogramming framework and domain specific language for writing commitment-based smart contracts that span multiple blockchain systems. The language allows programmers to write smart contracts at a higher level of abstraction by composing together contract blocks, without the need to specify how logic should be split across different blockchain instances. A runtime framework, including both on-chain and off-chain functionality, harmonises the features of different blockchain systems as well as enables communication across the smart contracts. A proof of concept, built on the Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchain systems and extendible to other systems, illustrates the technique and framework. We also show how the PORTHOS language is expressive enough to define a variety of applications.

AB Due to the immutable nature of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, it is of utter importance that a smart contract works as intended before employment outside test network. This is since any bugs or errors will become permanent once published to the live network, and could lead to substantial economic losses; as manifested in the infamous DAO smart contract exploit hack in 2016. In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful. However, as of today, formal verification is only successful on simple contracts, and does not support more advanced smart contract syntax.

AB We present an approach for analyzing Ethereum smart contracts regarding to the issue of 'gasless send' [1, p. 8]. Gasless send is about contracts which lose the ability to receive Ether due to gas depletion when executing the contract's fallback function. Our approach is based on the security analysis tool Mythril which is a framework for analyzing security issues in Ethereum smart contracts. Mythril's analysis engine is based on symbolic code execution and features different analyses for security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We upgraded the analysis engine in order to model the gas usage of Ethereum smart contracts during execution. In order to utilize the newly acquired data, we added an analysis module to detect fallback functions, whose execution may exceed the defined threshold of gas. Our analysis of 167,698 smart contracts currently deployed to the live Ethereum network shows that a total of 96.3 thousand (or 57%) might be affected by the issue of gasless send.

AB ''In God we trust, all others must bring data," quoted by W Edwards Deming an American engineer, statistician, and professor, have seemed to have taken quite the literal sense in this coming of age world were Robotics, Al, and Machine Learning have become the touchstone of evert., new burgeoning technology. Today data is not endemic to its source or any organization or an individual; data is omnipresent. Anywhere and everywhere, data flow can be observed, and these data can be saved and analyzed to obtain some confounding observations. To handle the processing of such massive and continually evolving datasets/databases, the concept of Rig Data was introduced. This paper discusses how Big Data technologies have been benign in the Healthcare domain.

AB This paper presents an innovative bare metal crypto terminal for blockchain. A Crypto Terminal performs a subset of wallet functionalities, in a way similar to bank smartcard, and associated terminals. Bare metal means that no firmware is present at delivery in order to avoid supply chain attacks. It also introduces a zero software point, from which it is possible to build a trust chain, thanks to integrity probe, and according to the "BigBang" paradigm.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer distributed cryptocurrency system, that keeps all transaction history in a public ledger known as blockchain. The Bitcoin network is implicitly pseudoanonymous and its nodes are controlled by independent entities making network analysis difficult.
   This calls for the development of a fully controlled testing environment. This paper presents Kriptosare.gen, a dockerized automatized Bitcoin testbed, for deploying full-scale custom Bitcoin networks. The testbed is deployed in a single machine executing four different experiments, each one with different network configuration. We perform a cost analysis to investigate how the resources are related with network parameters and provide experimental data quantifying the amount of computational resources needed to run the different types of simulations. Obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to run the testbed with a configuration similar to a real Bitcoin system.

AB Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solution for the problems that distribution system operators face due to an increase in the use of distributed energy resources and rapid growth in scalability of managing active distribution system (ADS). On the one hand, these changes pose a decentralized power system control problem, requiring strategic control to maintain reliability and resiliency for the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require robust financial markets while allowing participation from diverse prosumers. To support the computing and flexibility requirements of TES while preserving privacy and security, distributed software platforms are required. In this paper, we enable the study and analysis of security concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security Simulation Testbed (TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks. In this work, the testbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market, highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a blockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed computing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we identify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues. Future study of these differing paradigms is necessary and will continue as we develop our security simulation testbed.

AB Blockchains have been widely used in Internet of Things(IoT) applications including smart cities, smart home and smart governance to provide high levels of security and privacy. In this article, we advance a Blockchain based decentralized architecture for the storage of IoT data produced from smart home/cities. The architecture includes a secure communication protocol using a sign-encryption technique between power constrained IoT devices and a Gateway. The sign encryption also preserves privacy. We propose that a Software Agent executing on the Gateway selects a Miner node using performance parameters of Miners. Simulations demonstrate that the recommended Miner selection outperforms Proof of Works selection used in Bitcoin and Random Miner Selection.

AB Pervasive systems over the years continuous to grow exponentially. Engagement of IoT in fields such as Agriculture, Home automation, industrial applications etc is on the rise. Self organizing networks within the IoT field give rise to engagement of various nodes for data communication. The rise in Cyber-attacks within IoT pose a lot of threat to these connected nodes and hence there is a need for data passing through nodes to be verified during communication. In this paper we proposed a nodal authentication approach in IoT using blockchain in securing the integrity of data passing through the nodes in IoT. In our work, we engaged the GOST algorithm in our approach. At the end, we achieved a nodal authentication and verification of the transmitted data. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to fake a node in the communication chain of the connected nodes. Data integrity was achieved in the nodes during the communication.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB This article is part of a series of articles that describe an Integrated Decision Making Platform modeled after the human anatomy. In the first articles we presented the main components of the platform and the way they integrate with each other to form a cohesive and heterogeneous system. A resources is a quantifiable source of value and represents the scope or object of any decision making process. The allocation, management and distribution of resources is the main reason why a good decision making process becomes the essential factor that determines the success of any person, corporation, institution or state. The difference between success and failure is given by the way we decide to spend our resources. For this reason one vital component for a good decision making platform or system is the resource management component. The resource management and logistics component we will describe uses the blockchain as a robust, transparent and distributed ledger. The blockchain will not only allow us to keep track of our resources but using stored blockchain procedures, popularly called smart contracts, we can create the logistics for how we add, allocate, distribute and spend our resources

AB Blockchain techniques are attracting growing interest due to their capability of immutable and anonymous recording without any centralized authority. One of the difficulties blockchain researchers are facing is a lack of ways to verify behaviors of large scale blockchain networks. In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.

AB Future blockchain applications are anticipated to serve millions of users. Thus the evaluation of new blockchain applications have to consider large-scale assessment of the technologies behind the scene. Most of current testing approaches have been done either on simulators or via local small blockchain networks. Hence, the performance in real world conditions is unpredictable. This demonstration introduces BlockZoom, a large-scale blockchain testbed that runs on top of a highly reconfigurable and controllable HPC platform. BlockZoom presents a reproducible environment for experimenting distributed ledgers technologies and smart contract applications. Through different configuration scenarios developers can evaluate the applications performance and the blockchain behavior at a scale comparable to the production environment. The target audience of this demonstration includes researchers and developers in blockchain technology.

AB Know Your Customer (KYC) processes performed by banks on their customers are redundant, cumbersome and costly. Therefore, a system is proposed to automate menial tasks and allow sharing of data related to KYC. A blockchain dictates the collaboration between different participants and several services are built around it to support the functionality of the system as a whole. An access control system is used to share data legitimately.

AB Supply Chain Tracking (SCT) is considered as a major challenge for stakeholders of heterogeneous production, processing, transporting, storing, and selling systems. Studies on solutions in SCT reveal that many centralized SCT applications lack a design, which can support or even enable main features of a reliable, transparent, and publicly accessible SCT system for end users. This work demonstrates the implementation of a SCT application which, employs SC on the Ethereum blockchain (BC). This Decentralized Application (Dapp) provides a hardware-and platform-independent approach that flexibly enables multiple object combinations and transformations to be tracked with a use case-agnostic design and utilization.

AB Today's number of reputable academical publishers is dominated by few key players. This imbalance of supply and demand in publishing academic work makes the entire process inefficient. EUREKA is a blockchain-based scientific publishing platform, developed to address this imbalance. It offers the opportunity of a fair reward distribution for all contributors and immediate ownership rights to authors of an article. For the demonstration, the platform including the back-end and front-end integrated into the Ethereum blockchain is shown, and the interaction processes of users i.e., authors and reviewers are presented.

DE SDPP; Data Economy; IoT; Data Marketplace
AB Applications in the area of IoT and smart cities rely heavily on data to manage and control their operational environments. In such applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms help the government officials, city administrators, and industries to make an informed decision on managing their cities and factories using the data collected from various sources. As we step into the era where "data is termed as new oil", there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment. In this demo, we present SDPP and explain how it can contribute to the emerging data economy using a proof-of-concept implementation that uses TCP protocol for data communication and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger.

AB An enormous amount of energy is wasted in Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanisms adopted by popular blockchain applications (e.g., PoW-based cryptocurrencies) because miners must conduct a large amount of computation. Owing to this, one serious rising concern is that the energy waste not only dilutes the value of the blockchain but also hinders its further application. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain design that fully recycles the energy required for facilitating and maintaining it, which is re-invested to the computation of deep learning. We realize this by proposing Proof-of-Deep-Learning (PoDL) such that a valid proof for a new block can be generated if and only if a proper deep learning model is produced. We present a proof-of-concept design of PoDL that is compatible with the majority of the cryptocurrencies that are based on hash-based PoW mechanisms. Our benchmark and simulation results show that the proposed design is feasible for various popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

AB Democracy in the digital age has attracted a lot of public attention in recent years. However, bringing the human right of secrecy in voting to electronic systems is difficult. Properties, such as the possibility of verifying universally that any vote counted was indeed carrying the decision made by a voter, are often conflicting and a trade-off must be found. This paper proposes a blockchain-based electronic voting system providing explicitly cast-as-intended verifiability. By using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge any voter can verify that his or her encrypted vote represents the decision voted for while maintaining at the same time the secrecy of the ballot. In addition, any required cryptographic material can be generated in linear time with respect to the number of voters, making the system suitable for large scale elections, thus scalable.

AB Tor is a low-latency free anonymization network based on onion routing. In Tor, directory servers maintain a list of all nodes. It is, however, possible for a powerful adversary (e.g., law enforcement agencies) to seize or compromise enough directory servers and thus forge that list. Therefore, clients that obtained such a forged list of nodes can be effectively deanonymized. As a countermeasure, we propose to utilize a permissioned blockchain with a single voting committee that is privately "elected" by a verifiable random function (VRF). Since the blockchain provides us with integrity guarantees by design, we increase trust in the directory servers by decentralizing management of Tor nodes present in the shared list. We apply skiplist as an optimization reducing a validation overhead of newly joined nodes and clients. The proposed approach has only a small performance impact on the existing Tor infrastructure.

AB Permissioned blockchains have evolved as an alternative to permissionless blockchains for various closed business environments. In this paper, we develop FRChain, a scalable and high-performant consensus protocol for permissioned blockchains, which is resilient to different types of node and network failures. FRChain uses collective signing over multicast trees for block propagation and block validation. The protocol ensures safety and liveness as long as a majority of the nodes can participate in the protocol correctly. Further, we also demonstrate a technique for replacing failed nodes with correct ones. We have implemented and tested FRChain spread across a 5000 node blockchain network over two different data centers - (a) 35 Softlayer Cloud VMs located across Melbourne, Milan and San Jose, (b) Amazon VPC with 30 Amazon EC2 instances spread across Mumbai, Singapore, Tokyo and Frankfurt. Our experiments show that FRChain is scalable in terms of both transaction throughput and network size.

AB In the late 90s the author Ian Grigg defined that smart contracts have to be human-readable like paper contracts while remaining processible by computer programs. The Ethereum Foundation has created a new programming language Solidity that can be used to implement smart contracts. However, the contracts are neither easy to implement nor easy-to-use by the common user. In order to enable users without programming skills to take advantage of the new technology, we propose a generator for smart contracts. Our prototype uses a configuration wizard to determine the requirements of the generated contract. Based on the official ERC Standards of the Ethereum community we will implement a prototype that can configure and generate customized contracts. Moreover, we are covering the challenges that we have to face in order to support automated test case generation and automated deployment processes.

DE Blockchain; Private file system; P2P Network
AB The blockchain technology has been changing our daily lives since Bitcoin-i.e., the first decentralized cryptocurrency-was invented and released as open-source software by an unidentified person or a group called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Of many applications which can be implemented based on the blockchain, storage is an important one, a notable example of which is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed web based on a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open and focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file storage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based File System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is an abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network cluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage service and faster message propagation. Advance proxy re-encryption algorithm is applied to guarantee secure file exchanges under permission. Merkle tree will make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a balanced way. The proposed MTFS can be used not only for personal file storage and exchange but also for industry requiring mutual trust in file uploading and downloading in making contracts like insurances.

   Decentralized Application
AB Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) is criticized for its security and privacy issues, since cryptocurrency users are required to surrender their private keys to the exchange. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) solves this issue by introducing additional trading gas fee and latency to the system. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the advantages of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is still suffering from two issues. The first issue is that it is unfriendly for a trader who needs to exchange tokens frequently within a certain period of time, due to the fact that it is time-consuming and expensive. The second issue is the potential network congestion in Ethereum caused by excessive simultaneous transactions from the exchange. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate network congestion.

AB Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a widely used collaborative inventory management policy in which manufacturers/vendors manage the inventory of retailers and take responsibility for making decisions related to the timing and extent of inventory replenishment. There exist several prerequisites for a successful VMI strategy implementation like information sharing, trust, systems integration and long-term collaboration. However, in nowadays logistics flows, complex processes, high number of participants and complex distribution channels impede the successful adoption of VMI strategies. In this paper, we propose a new interaction framework based on smart contracts and blockchain for governing the relationship between the vendor and the buyer. A use-case VMI scenario is presented along with a functional smart contract. Tests performed using a local private blockchain illustrate the applicability of the proposed architecture along with the significant benefits for each participant.

AB The blockchain technology enables mutually untrusting participants to reach consensus on the state of a distributed and decentralized ledger (called a blockchain) in a permissionless setting. The consensus protocol of the blockchain imposes a unified view of the system state over the global network, and once a block is stable in the blockchain, its data is visible to all users and cannot be retrospectively modified or removed. Due to these properties, the blockchain technology is regarded as a general consensus infrastructure and based on which a variety of systems have been built.
   This article presents a study and survey of permissionless blockchain systems in the context of secure logging. We postulate the most essential properties required by a secure logging system and by considering a wide range of applications, we give insights into how the blockchain technology matches these requirements. Based on the survey, we motivate related research perspectives and challenges for blockchain-based secure logging systems, and we highlight potential solutions to some specific problems.

DE Blockchain; Energy trading; Proof-of-concept
AB Blockchain is increasingly being used as a distributed, anonymous, trustless framework for energy trading in smart grids. However, most of the existing solutions suffer from reliance on Trusted Third Parties (TTP) and processing overheads. In our previous work, we have proposed a Secure Private Blockchain-based framework (SPB) for energy trading to address the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we present a proof-on-concept implementation of SPB on the Ethereum private network to demonstrates SPB's applicability for energy trading. We benchmark SPB's performance against the relevant state-of-the-art. The implementation results demonstrate that SPB incurs lower overheads and monetary cost for end users to trade energy compared to existing solutions.

DE blockchain; privacy; logging; data provenance; auditing
AB Today a massive amount of data is used for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive knowledge about the world and do automated decision making. All this data contains personal and/or sensitive data, and thus privacy is becoming more and more important. The European Union's GDPR [9] recognizes the importance of transparency with respect to the handling of personal data. Hence it is desirable to devise means for increasing the transparency of personal data handling within an organization besides documenting processes of personal data handling. We employ blockchains as a basic building block to increase transparency with respect to personal data handling. A public blockchain serves as a trust anchor for a private blockchain, whereas the private blockchain serves as a log storage for the handling (i.e., access to and processing of) of personal and/or sensitive data. By giving the customer access to the private blockchain the customer's trust in the enterprise is increased.

AB Multimedia data, especially images are increasing dramatically. Images published on the Web are more often facing the risk of being tampered or manipulated since their content is easily mutable. Using blockchain technology provides advantages and, at the same time, challenges when dealing with this issue due to the following reasons: (a) data in a blockchain are well saved and immutable and (b) adding the data directly to a blockchain may consume much time which makes it computationally and economically expensive. Thus, we propose a blockchain-based solution which considers two key aspects: First, using a blockchain to register information about ownership and copyrights for authors, as well as descriptive information of an image, used to detect copyright violations. Second, avoiding insertion of raw image data into the blockchain, but storing only unique descriptive metadata about the images, allowing for a more efficient implementation of the system. This work considers different well-known image matching approaches to validate the power of the proposed approach, which allows for an efficient checking of violations of copyrights for a given image.

AB Nowadays, the authenticating procedure for transactions is still complicated, and the current Value-Added Tax (VAT) administration system works as centralized server, which consists of high-risk attacks from hackers. Therefore, only a few countries use digital technologies to calculate and manage the VAT payment despite of their benefits. In this paper, by combining decentralized storage network (DSN) with the smart contract (SC), we propose a new model based on Blockchain technology to authenticate the transaction, calculate Value-Added Tax and approve VAT payment. This system runs in a host computer (host PC) for encrypting and decrypting data. The smart contract is implemented in Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Ethereum platform. Experiential results show that the new model not only saves the cost for authenticating transactions but also protects the data from hacker's attacks due to consensus property of the Blockchain technology.

DE Blockchian; Smart contracts; DApp; Randomness extraction
AB Randomness is a significant ingredient to achieve fairness on many applications (i.e., gambling). On the use of blockchain and smart contract, we observe that some existing lottery and gambling games involve one single source to produce randomness. As known, Fomo3D uses the game state to determine the winner, whereas TrueFlip uses the blockchain state (at a specific point in time). Those system do not rely on significant randomness extraction. In this paper, we present a lottery DApp and implement it by using smart contracts. In this DApp, the randomness is determined not only from game and blockchain states, but also from committees.

DE Blockchain; interoperability; standards; video games
AB Current solutions for designing and building decentralized blockchain applications lack interoperability. Consequently, blockchains and existing technologies do not integrate well in a unified framework. This integration is necessary to work around some of the blockchains constraints, such as scalability of transactions and ergonomics. Indeed, blockchains are not suitable for huge data storage, but there are distributed data storage solutions that can be used in a decentralized blockchain application. Regarding ergonomics, the use of blockchain technology should be in the background and transparent for users that may not know how to set up and secure a blockchain-based application.
   We propose an architecture aiming to easily link existing decentralized technologies and blockchains. We then discuss the impact of this architecture for the video game industry. As a result, we propose an original data representation of blockchain gaming assets in order to improve data exchanges in this industry.

AB Decentralized ledger has been found in many enterprise applications, such as cross-border transaction processing and supply chain management that multiple companies involved. While enjoying all the benefits of the decentralized ledger technology, there is a burden for each party to maintain its own IT infrastructure to run the decentralized ledger node. Therefore, the concept of blockchain-as-a-service has been proposed where these nodes are kept in the cloud. Blockchain-as-a-service greatly reduces the burden to adopt the decentralized ledger technology but also introduces a new security threat. To mitigate these concerns, we propose an FPGA based decentralized ledger for enterprise applications, which leverages security features of FPGA to prevent unauthorized access to data stored on the ledger without affecting all the desirable features of the decentralized ledger. We also implement the major components and evaluate their cost/performance to demonstrate the practicality.

AB This paper discusses the design of a mobile number portability processing system in the telecom domain with a solution proposed using permissioned private blockchain technology. As a first step, the system is designed to be managed by a neutral entity. Subsequently, the design is extended to be supported by a neutral blockchain-based platform. The Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform is used as the framework to develop the solution. Channels are utilized for different subsets of nodes that interact with each other to enable transactions in the system. Concurrent state transition graph paths are utilized to enable faster processing in the blockchain system. The paper concludes with experimental results and possibilities for future extensions.

AB Money, when viewed as a social construct, can be a powerful tool for organizing society and allocating finite resources. However, existing monetary systems are highly centralized and this centralization has caused many crises in recent times. We therefore propose a token-based economic system that is self-regulating, can adjust the quantity of tokens to provide liquidity as needed, and avoids moral hazards. An early version of this system has been implemented on a blockchain platform as the Sora decentralized autonomous economy (DAE). Through allocating votes in a Sybil-resistant way, the Sora DAE democratically allocates new purchasing power according to open referendums. A dual-token system allows both stability of value for payments and creation of tokens for economic growth.

AB Data is central to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Most of the current IoT systems are using centralized cloud-based data sharing systems. Involvement of such third-party service provider requires also trust from both sensor owner and sensor data user. Moreover, the fees need to be paid for their services. To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the payments, this paper presents a blockchain based proxy re-encryption scheme. The system stores the IoT data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To share the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and the data user without the involvement of a trusted third party. It also uses an efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which allows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the smart contract. The proposed system is implemented in an Ethereum based testbed to analyze the performance and security properties.

AB Smart contracts are designed to facilitate the performance of trackable and irreversible transactions without the need for third party involvement. Therefore, as a result of this lack of oversight, it is essential that these smart contracts are written and properly tested. In this paper, we examine some of the prominent risks and challenges involved with writing and implementing smart contracts and discuss how each of these challenges can be overcome. We focus on contracts executed on Ethereum, the most prominent smart contract platform.

AB A cooperative network defense is one approach to fend off large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this regard, the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS) is a multi-domain, blockchain-based, cooperative DDoS defense system, where each Autonomous System (AS) is taking part in the defense alliance. Each AS can exchange attack information about ongoing attacks via the Ethereum blockchain. However, the currently operational implementation of BloSS is not interactive or visualized, but the DDoS mitigation is automated. In real-world defense systems, a human cybersecurity analyst decides whether a DDoS threat should be mitigated or not. Thus, this work presents the design of a security management dashboard for BloSS, designed for interactive use by cybersecurity analysts.

DE Workflow automation; smart contracts; tooling
AB We have been involved in the development of several blockchain-based solutions that largely utilize workflows. Workflows are used to guide users from independent organizations to process and manage transactions, data and documents in a trusted, immutable, and transparent manner for all relevant entities on a given blockchain network. This work discusses our approach to automate the process of creating, updating, and using workflows for blockchain-based solutions. In particular, we present a workflow definition schema using existing templates. We also show how the workflow definition is used to automate the generation of graphical user interfaces and the possibility of generating associated blockchain smart contracts in the future.

AB Blockchain technology provides the advantage of maintaining a network without third party intervention, providing transparency because all participants have distributed ledgers with the same data. Using these characteristics, blockchain technology is being used in various fields, but the anonymity of blockchain can be exploited for illegal trades in the Darknet market. Therefore, a monitoring system for transactions occurring on the blockchain is needed. This paper proposes a monitoring system and an explorer to show the results collected from the system.

DE Blockchain; Fog Computing; Scaling; Sidechain; Plasma
AB Considering the Internet-of-Things, the blockchain technology has recently become a major focus of research. One of its major drawbacks is given by the poor performance of blockchain systems subject to heavy load. In particular, systems which use Proof-of-Work as leader election strategy are not suitable for an active participation of IoT devices. We propose a new system architecture which uses the Plasma framework to integrate blockchain technology and fog computing and evaluate the performance of its prototype. The Plasma framework has the advantage to provide a scalable hierarchical design based on sidechains and an off-chain scaling strategy which is agnostic with regard to the architecture of the employed root chain.

DE Blockchain; Distributed Ledger; Directed Acyclic Graphs
AB This work explores a new low-latency distributed ledger structure based on bounded width directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this design, each user has their own blockchain traceable back to a common root. These individual chains mutually witness each other to confirm transactions and form a global partially ordered set of events. The number of witness hashes required to establish new blocks is defined as the "DAG width". This width has an upper bound which of the total number of users in the system, though the actual number of witnesses required is usually far less. In this paper we mathematically model the expected DAG width using analytical techniques from the near miss birthday problem and simulate expected widths for expected network latency and user activity.

   crowdfunding; ICOs
AB ICOs (Initial Coin Offering) have recently become the favorite fund raising method for entrepreneurs and startups. Research indicates that a successful ICO could provide a helpful precedence for those who are in need of raising funds in the near future. In addition, the results could help the regulatory authorities identify the elements and factors which should be taken into consideration if ICOs were subject to regulation. The purpose of this study is to discover the factors which may affect the success of an ICO from 533 ICO samples which successfully raised over 5 million US dollars during the past two-year period. In general, we found that the following elements of ICOs have significant positive correlation to the final amount of fund raised, including, a higher amount of total token supply, acceptance of fiat as consideration in exchange for tokens, using the USA as an issue country, a higher percentage of token allocation to subscribers, a higher percentage of token allocation to advisors, a higher percentage of token allocation to ecosystem development, and introducing a post-ICO bonus scheme. On the contrary, we found that the following have a negative correlation to the final amount of the fund raised in an ICO: making use of bonus schemes in the ICO process, and applying longer lock-up periods in an ICO. We hope the research result will provide a new perspective for fund raisers and the government authorities.

AB As the benefits of blockchain become clear, in the past year we have witnessed an explosive growth in the use of blockchain based systems. However, as with any new technology, adoption of blockchain carries with it, as yet not widely known, risks that should be properly evaluated and understood prior to design and development. Given the purely distributed nature of blockchain, in which nodes can span continents, a key aspect in planning and designing blockchain systems which is not readily incorporated in a modern architect's vernacular is consideration of eventual consistency, system stability and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. This is compounded by the fact that, as yet, very few practical tools are available to help architects better understand and plan for the above. In this paper we introduce BlockSIM, a comprehensive and open source blockchain system simulation tool which can assist blockchain architects better evaluate the performance of planned private blockchain networks by running scenarios and decide the optimal system parameters suited for their purposes. We compare the results of our simulation with real blockchain networks and demonstrate that BlockSIM can be used effectively by architects of blockchain systems to plan and implement scalable, stable and resilient blockchain networks. Finally, we demonstrate via a real-life example how architects can apply BlockSIM to plan and design real-world blockchain systems.

DE Bitcoin; network Topology; PageRank Algorithm; Nodes geolocation
AB In massive, dynamic and distributed P2P networks like Bitcoin, where thousands of updates occur per second, it is hard to obtain an accurate topology representing the structure of the network as a graph with nodes and links by using the traditional local measurement approaches based on batches, offline data, or on the discovery of the topology around a small set of nodes and then combine them to discover an approximate network topology. All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system, which performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links with the use of a customized version of the Page-Rank algorithm that assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing. The topology discovery system allows us to gain knowledge on the Bitcoin network size, the network stability in term of well-connected Bitcoin nodes, as well as some data regarding the Bitcoin nodes geolocation.

DE Forensic; Bitcoin; Classification
AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency whose transactions are recorded in a common ledger, so called blockchain. Due to the anonymity and lack of law enforcement, Bitcoin has been misused in darknet markets which deal with illegal products, such as drugs and weapons. Therefore from the security forensics aspect, it is demanded to establish an approach to identify newly emerged darknet markets' transactions and addresses. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze Bitcoin transactions and addresses related to darknet markets and propose a novel identification method of darknet markets' addresses. To improve the identification performance, we propose a voting based method which decides the labels of multiple addresses controlled by the same user based on the number of the majority label. Through the computer simulation with more than 200K Bitcoin addresses, it was shown that our voting based method outperforms the nonvoting based one in terms of precision, recal, and F1 score. We also found that DNM's addresses pay higher fees than others, which significantly improves the classification.

DE Bitcoin; Centrality Measure; Transaction Graph
AB In this work, we consider the graph of confirmed transactions in bitcoin. Understanding this graph is essential to discern the different economic activities conducted by the pseudonymous actors. In addition to traditional graph analysis methods, new metrics need to be engineered specifically for the bitcoin transaction graph. Hence, we propose a new centrality measure named mint centrality. The measure uses the inherent tree structure of transactions in bitcoin and their relation to the corresponding set of coinbase transactions, and can be evaluated with linear complexity. We present preliminary results of the mint centrality on the first 200,000 blocks of the public bitcoin blockchain.

AB Although cryptocurrencies have attracted a large amount of users and investors and there has been various researches in the area of distributed ledger technology (DLT), there is little work on cryptocurrency studies. Given the rapidly increasing number and diversity of cryptocurrencies, we present a landscape with a selective set of representative cryptocurrencies to holistically portray their characteristics and provide practitioners an analysis from both business and technical perspectives. The focused observations elaborate how the typical cryptocurrency are designed and operated in industry. This study offers a breakthrough understanding of the cryptocurrencies through the generated landscape which report the state of cryptocurrencies, and can be used as a framework for cryptocurrency analysis.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors have become cheaper and more ubiquitous than ever [1]. From smart thermometers to home assistants and smartphones, massive amounts of data are being streamed in real-time by sensors that are continuously connected to the web. However, these data tend to be amassed in private silos that are difficult to access. Many private companies and public institutions could build valuable services with these data but so far few solutions have been proposed on how to bridge this gap. In this paper we introduce Hermes, a platform for trading sensor data using distributed ledgers as intermediaries to add safeguards against malicious behavior.

AB This paper investigates the specification and verification of atomic swap multi-party transactions. It is argued that logics with the ability to express properties of strategies of players in a multi-agent setting are conceptually useful for this purpose, although ultimately, the less expressive setting of temporal logic suffices for verification of concrete implementations. This is illustrated through the use of a model checker to verify atomic swap smart contracts in on-chain and cross-chain settings.

AB Even though a token economy is the core part of a blockchain-based project, it is still in the early stage of academic exploration. Moreover, recent projects adopt multi-token economies to encourage the participants to stay longer in their economic systems, which are more complicated than single token economies. This paper addresses the token classification, the reason for adopting multi-token economies and the effectiveness of them. We analyze the Steemit as a representative example of multi-token economies. We describe how the multi-token economy has been working and show the distinctive features of multi-token economies. We also propose the evaluation criteria for multi-token economies.

AB Blockchain architectures and applications emerged from the Bitcoin model, and are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. This perception has driven the reward mechanisms for the various kinds of coin mining fueled consensus techniques seen in the vast majority of blockchain applications.
   As an alternative to reward mechanisms via coin payment, we propose denial of service to the application in question and/or revocation of participant confidentiality as punishment mechanisms for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, to be used as part of the incentive mix sustaining the application. This obviates or diminishes the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with all their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem and market manipulation demerits.
   We emphatically stress the importance of correctly balancing diverse application specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications.

DE Token-curated registry; decentralized recommendations; Blockchain
AB Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems- incentivizing token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two key dimenions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed token-inflation mechanism is employed.

DE Proof of delivery; blockchain; P2P network
AB We propose a novel proof of delivery (PoD) mechanism to incentivize peers to participate in peer-to-peer content delivery services in a secure and effective fashion. By analyzing transaction records on a blockchain, the PoD can detect a fraudulent peer which does not pay for its content retrieval. Moreover, the PoD can enhance the delivery performance of a trustworthy peer by substantiating the notion of a trust window, whose size is proportional to the trustworthiness of a peer. That is, a trustworthy peer will experience enhanced delivery performance while a fraudulent one will be isolated from the network, which is checked by simulation results.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gained increasing adoption in recent years, and many hope that they may usher in a new era of decentralized electronic money. Unfortunately, they perform the core functions of money quite poorly due to their extremely volatile market value. On the other hand, blockchain "stablecoins" aiming to reduce this volatility, usually through a peg to an external currency like the US dollar, tend to greatly sacrifice decentralization of the money supply that make cryptocurrencies so attractive in the first place.
   Elasticoin is a novel currency issuance algorithm which greatly reduces price volatility by using the cryptographic puzzle of proofs of sequential work to fix the cost of minting a coin to sequential computation time. This causes coin supply to be highly elastic, quickly responding to demand for new coins and greatly dampening price swings. We argue that Elasticoin's fixed-minting-cost approach to low volatility has significant advantages over using pegs or explicit measurement of demand to adjust supply.

AB Routing on the Internet is defined among autonomous systems (ASes) based on a weak trust model where it is assumed that ASes are honest. While this trust model strengthens the connectivity among ASes, it results in an attack surface which is exploited by malicious entities to hijacking routing paths. One such attack is known as the BGP prefix hijacking, in which a malicious AS broadcasts IP prefixes that belong to a target AS, thereby hijacking its traffic. In this paper, we propose RouteChain: a blockchain-based secure BGP routing system that counters BGP hijacking and maintains a consistent view of the Internet routing paths. Towards that, we leverage provenance assurance and tamper-proof properties of blockchains to augment trust among ASes. We group ASes based on their geographical (network) proximity and construct a bi-hierarchical blockchain model that detects false prefixes prior to their spread over the Internet. We validate strengths of our design by simulations and show its effectiveness by drawing a case study with the Youtube hijacking of 2008. Our proposed scheme is a standalone service that can be incrementally deployed without the need of a central authority.

AB Today, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is applied to everywhere providing tremendous amounts of IoT service such as home control, facility management, and social public services. The GS1, a non-profit international standard organization, standardized an Object Name Service (ONS) which enables users to manage and discover services in the midst of tremendous amounts of service. However, it has a vulnerability in security and fault tolerance of providing service, because the ONS operates based on the DNS protocol. It is weak against data tampering attacks caused by DNS cache poisoning, spoofing, and local DNS cracking. It has a weak fault tolerance from problems with attack or malfunction. In this paper, we propose a BlockONS, which is novel ONS based on a blockchain. It provides a strength in data tampering attacks allowing a fault tolerance for sustainable service. The BlockONS consists of new service data modeling for an off-chain scaling, data tampering validation method, and fault tolerance mechanism. We designed the BlockONS into two parts: a BlockONS Node part to valid data tampering, and a BlockONS Agent part for scaling and fault tolerance. Finally, we implement the BlockONS prototype using a Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain and intel i5 NUC. We proof the feasibility of the BlockONS by comparing with performance of an existing ONS.

However, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a centralized architecture, wherein the data from all the publishers in the application network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a centralized architecture makes the publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to Byzantine failures. For example, it provides an opportunity for the organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with Byzantine fault-tolerance and blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network, and stores the data in an immutable ledger through the use of blockchain technology. Through the use of consensus protocols and distributed ledger technology, Trinity can guarantee ordering, fault-tolerance, persistence and immutability across trust boundaries.
   Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal resources. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the first framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with the publish-subscribe messaging model. Furthermore, we plan to use Trinity in a real-world use case for increasing the transparency of racial profiling.

AB We present an overview of hybrid Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG): a Proof-of-Stake checkpointing protocol overlaid onto Ethereum's Proof-of-Work blockchain. We describe its core functionalities and reward scheme, and explore its properties. Our findings indicate that Casper's implemented incentives mechanism ensures liveness, while providing safety guarantees that improve over standard Proof-of-Work protocols. Based on a minimal-impact implementation of the protocol as a smart contract on the blockchain, we discuss additional issues related to parametrisation, funding, throughput and network overhead and detect potential limitations.

AB The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first proposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called the blockchain. Imagine that you could run the Bitcoin protocol on a quantum computer. What advantages can be had over classical Bitcoin? This is the question we answer here by introducing Quantum Bitcoin which, among other features, has immediate local verification of transactions. This is a major improvement over classical Bitcoin since we no longer need the computationally-intensive and time-consuming method of recording all transactions in the blockchain. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum currency, and this paper introduces the necessary tools including a novel two-stage quantum mining process. In addition, we have counterfeiting resistance, fully anonymous and free transactions, and a smaller footprint than classical Bitcoin.
   In this paper we construct Quantum Bitcoin, a novel currency that draws its inspiration from both Bitcoin and quantum mechanics. As we later show, our new currency has several interesting advantages over existing payment systems, although the drawback is that it requires a quantum computer to function.

   non-deterministic; read-write conflict; transactions order dependency
AB Blockchain is one of the most popular distributed ledger technologies. In order to solve the trustless problems between enterprises, many permissioned blockchain platforms are proposed in recent years. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain which is comprised of chaincode, endorsing peers, ordering service, committing peers and membership service. Fabric provides identity authentication, transactions encryption and high performance. Hence, decentralized application based on Fabric can be applied among enterprises to implement the immutable and high throughput for transactions. However, some limitations still exist in Fabric framework. This paper surveys the risk of non-deterministic transactions in Fabric, which can be caused by read-write conflict and transactions order dependency. Transactions are judged to be invalid by committing peers when read-write conflict exists. Besides, transactions submission order may be disrupted during endorsing and ordering. Both of the two risks can make the final transaction execution result nondeterministic. Finally, a solution of cache layer on Fabric client is proposed to solve the risk of non-deterministic transactions.

DE Blockchain-based Applications; Escrow; Smart Contract; Trustless Payment
AB A fundamental problem for electronic commerce is the buying and selling of digital goods between individuals that may not know or trust each other. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by the use of trusted third-parties such as credit-card companies, mediated escrows, legal adjudication, or reputation systems. Despite the rise of blockchain protocols as a way to send payments without trusted third parties, the important problem of exchanging a digital good for payment without trusted third parties has been paid much less attention. We refer to this problem as the Buyer and Seller's Dilemma and present for it a dual-deposit escrow trade protocol which uses double-sided payment deposits in conjunction with simple cryptographic primitives, and that can be implemented using a blockchain-based smart contract. We analyze our protocol as an extensive-form game and prove that the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium for this game is for both the buyer and seller to cooperate and behave honestly. We address this problem under the assumption that the digital good being traded is known and verifiable, with a fixed price known to both parties.

AB In high-stakes multi-party policy making based on machine learning and simulation models involving independent computing agents, a notion of trust in results is critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration. Using a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computation blocks and a blockchain-based immutable audit mechanism, this work proposes a framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular we address the scalability problem by reducing the storage and communication costs using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not only verifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations, and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example of training a neural network.

AB In this paper, we present a new form of attack that can be carried out on the memory pools (mempools) of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Towards that end, we study such an attack on Bitcoin mempool and explore its effects on transactions fee paid by legitimate users. We also propose countermeasures to contain such an attack. Our countermeasures include fee-based and age-based designs, which optimize the mempool size and help in countering the effects of DDoS attacks. We further evaluate our designs by simulations and analyze their usefulness in varying attack conditions. Our analyses can be extended to other blockchain-based applications which use memory pools to cache network activities.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that features a distributed, decentralized and trustworthy mechanism, which has made Bitcoin a popular global transaction platform. The transaction efficiency among nations and the privacy benefiting from address anonymity of the Bitcoin network have attracted many activities such as payments, investments, gambling, and even money laundering in the past decade. Unfortunately, some criminal behaviors which took advantage of this platform were not identified. This has discouraged many governments to support cryptocurrency. Thus, the capability to identify criminal addresses becomes an important issue in the cryptocurrency network. In this paper, we propose new features in addition to those commonly used in the literature to build a classification model for detecting abnormality of Bitcoin network addresses. These features include various high orders of moments of transaction time (represented by block height) which summarizes the transaction history in an efficient way. The extracted features are trained by supervised machine learning methods on a labeling category data set. The experimental evaluation shows that these features have improved the performance of Bitcoin address classification significantly. We evaluate the results under eight classifiers and achieve the highest Micro-F1 / Macro-F1 of 87% / 86% with LightGBM.

DE blockchain; distributed trust; multi-party model sharing
AB Policy decisions are increasingly dependent on the outcomes of simulations and/or machine learning models. The ability to share and interact with these outcomes is relevant across multiple fields and is especially critical in the disease modeling community where models are often only accessible and workable to the researchers that generate them. This work presents a blockchain-enabled system that establishes a decentralized trust between parties involved in a modeling process. Utilizing the OpenMalaria framework, we demonstrate the ability to store, share and maintain auditable logs and records of each step in the simulation process, showing how to validate results generated by computational workers. We also show how the system monitors worker outputs to rank and identify faulty workers via comparison to nearest neighbors or historical reward spaces as a means of ensuring model quality.

AB The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) negotiated and administered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) regulates the international trade of endangered species and derived products through a permit-based system. Currently, the permit process is paper-based and hence highly prone to manipulations and errors. Being aware of blockchains' potential, the CITES Secretariat defined a challenge to determine whether a blockchain-based system can address the aforementioned issues and serve as a secure, efficient, and affordable permit processing system.
   In this paper, we respond to the CITES Blockchain Challenge. First, we analyze the permit process and discuss how blockchain systems can improve that process in a way traditional systems cannot. Building on these results, we design a blockchain-based system that enables secure, manipulation- resistant permit validation, produces an immutable record of processed permits, and is in compliance with the CITES agreement. To evaluate this design, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation compatible with the paper-based permit process and deployed it to a Proof-of-Authority-based blockchain network. This allows incremental adoption and integration with the existing process, thereby increasing acceptance and addressing affordability. Finally, we describe how a blockchain- based system could disruptively improve the established permit process by enforcing quotas and tracking provenance.

AB Out casting, sharing, and publishing the collected knowledge, experiences, and outputs of scientific works, regardless of being empirical or purely theoretical, has always been one of the key assets of human evolution. However, on one hand, re-usability of published work depends on accessibility, and, on the other hand, om the correctness of published work. Studies on the traditional scientific publishing platforms reveal many deficits with those systems, which had been addressed with the proposed blockchain-based solution called Eureka. Eureka enables high quality reviews of tthe published work, while incentivizing authors and reviewers to participate in this decentralized, open, and public scientific publishing platform.

AB Blockchain technology enables the operation of fully decentralized applications without the need for a central authority to manage the execution of the underlying process. However, a critical limitation in the technology today is the inability for such applications to query information external to the blockchain. Applications must make use of a decentralized oracle, i.e. a trusted source of external information. In this work we propose the paired-question decentralized oracle protocol, designed to extract true answers from the public. When querying the oracle, a user submits pairs of antithetic questions and voting users answer them for the chance to receive rewards. This new protocol lends itself to a simple formal analysis, and it is shown to strongly incentivize a Nash equilibrium of truthful reporting. This paper also discusses a number of extensions to the base protocol to improve its cost-effectiveness, security, and applicability.

AB Access control is one of the fundamental security mechanisms of IT systems. Most existing access control schemes rely on a centralized party to manage and enforce access control policies. As decentralized ledger technologies, especially permissioned networks, find more applicability beyond cryptocurrencies in enterprise solutions is expected that the security requirements will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an access control system that works in a decentralized environment without compromising the unique features of a decentralized ledger. Decentralized ledger based access control schemes have been proposed but have limitations such as lack of capability to protect the access history and detect/tolerate malicious participants. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel decentralized ledger based access control system that utilizes cryptography. The newly proposed system is flexible and works with various storage system. The proposed system also provides verifiability for end users to detect compromised nodes in the decentralized ledger and high level privacy. We implement the scheme using Hyperledger Fabric and give detailed information of the prototype, and also assess its performance to show that it is practical for real world applications.

AB Organizations nowadays are largely computerized, with a mixture of internal and external services providing them with on-demand functionality. In some situations (e.g. emergency situations), cross-organizational collaboration is needed, providing external users access to internal services. Trust between partners in such a collaboration can however be an issue. Although (federated) access control policies may be in place, it is unclear which data was requested and delivered after a collaboration has finished. This may lead to disputes between participating organizations. The open-source permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to create a logging mechanism for the actions performed by the participants in such a collaboration. This paper presents the architecture needed for such a logging mechanism and provides details on its operation. A prototype was designed in order to evaluate the performance of an asynchronous logging approach. Measurements show that the proposed logging mechanism enables organizations to create a log of service interactions with limited delay imposed on the data exchange process.

AB In Blockchain networks involving multiple applications, the quality of service of an application is affected by the transaction ordering. We study a setting where each application is represented by a node, which might attempt to prioritize its own transactions through including them early in blocks added to the blockchain. A fair block proposal of a node follows a random selection of the transactions among the set of pending transactions the node is aware of. On the contrary, a dishonest node includes more of its transactions at the expense of transactions of other applications. In this work, we propose a toolbox of techniques to enforce such a fair block selection. First, we design an accurate statistical testing for the honesty of a proposal and explain it. Next, we describe a reputation system, documenting honesty of nodes to encourage fairness. Our last technique enforces fair block selection through concise commitments on the set of pending transactions known to a node.

AB Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols rely on voting mechanisms to reach consensus on the current state. If an enhanced majority of staking nodes, also called validators, agree on a proposed block, then this block is appended to the blockchain. Yet, these protocols remain vulnerable to faults caused by validators who abstain either accidentally or maliciously.
   To protect against such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate our results to the design of current PoS protocols.

AB Trusted collaboration satisfying the requirements of (a) adequate transparency and (b) preservation of privacy of business sensitive information is a key factor to ensure the success and adoption of online business-to-business (B2B) collaboration platforms. Our work proposes novel ways of stringing together game theoretic modeling, blockchain technology, and cryptographic techniques to build such a platform for B2B collaboration involving enterprise buyers and sellers who may be strategic. The B2B platform builds upon three ideas. The first is to use a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts as the technical infrastructure for building the platform. Second, the above smart contracts implement deep business logic which is derived using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of the strategic interactions between buyers and sellers to devise strategies to induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers. Third, we present a formal framework that captures the essential requirements for secure and private B2B collaboration, and, in this direction, we develop cryptographic regulation protocols that, in conjunction with the blockchain, help implement such a framework. We believe our work is an important first step in the direction of building a platform that enables B2B collaboration among strategic and competitive agents while maximizing social welfare and addressing the privacy concerns of the agents.

AB Companies are eager to invest in the emerging blockchain technology, but often fail to integrate this technology into real-world business applications that go beyond cryptocurrencies or pure demonstrators. The reason often lies in specific requirements related to data security and privacy. Current blockchain solutions are not able to meet these requirements, preventing a broad adoption of blockchain technology in business applications. To tackle this problem, we introduce UBI: a Universal Blockchain Integrator. UBI acts as a middleware between a company's legacy IT infrastructure and off-the-shelf blockchain solutions. UBI enriches the functionality of these solutions so that they meet specific security and privacy requirements. Its successful implementation shows the feasibility of the proposed solution. First evaluation results demonstrate its potential for real-world business applications.

ID PROOFS
AB In today's programmable blockchains, smart contracts are limited to being deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners.
   We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs.

AB With the advent of blockchain technologies, the idea of decentralized applications has gained traction. Smart contracts permit the implementation of application logic to foster distributed systems that are capable of removing intermediaries. Hereby, lock in effects originating from isolated data storage and central authorities are mitigated. Yet, smart contracts deployed to a ledger generate dependencies on the underlying blockchain. Over time, requirements regarding contract execution may detach from the utilized blockchain due to contradicting incentives and security or performance issues. To avoid a novel form of lock in effect towards a host blockchain, we introduce a concept for smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic and state between blockchains in a flexible and verifiable manner. As the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain implementations, it poses a common execution environment for smart contracts. We provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between EVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing the migration process. To prove the concept's soundness, we transfer token contracts based on the ERC20 standard as well as applications containing dependencies to other smart contracts. Our evaluation shows the validity of ported applications including their current states.

AB Blockchain systems promise to mediate interactions of mutually distrusting parties without a trusted third party. However, protocols with full smart contract-based security are either limited in functionality or complex, with high costs for secured interactions. This observation leads to the development of protocol-specific schemes to avoid costly dispute resolution in case all participants remain honest. In this paper, we introduce SmartJudge, an extensible generalization of this trend for smart contract-based two-party protocols. SmartJudge relies on a protocol-independent mediator smart contract that moderates two-party interactions and only consults protocol-specific verifier smart contracts in case of a dispute. This way, SmartJudge avoids verification costs in absence of disputes and sustains interaction confidentiality among honest parties. We implement verifier smart contracts for cross-blockchain trades and exchanging digital goods and show that SmartJudge can reduce costs by 46-50% and 22% over current state of the art, respectively.

DE Bitcoin; blockchain; churn; propagation delay; distribution fitting
AB Efficient and reliable propagation of blocks is vital for ensuring the scalability of the Bitcoin network. As a result, several schemes have been proposed over the last few years to speed up the block propagation, most notably the compact block protocol (BIP 152). Despite this, we show experimental evidence that (i) the vast majority (97%) of Bitcoin nodes exhibit intermittent network connectivity (churn), and (ii) this churn results in significant numbers of unsuccessful compact blocks, roughly twice the figure for continuously connected nodes. Specifically, we conduct experiments on the Bitcoin network that show that churn results in a 135% average increase in block propagation time (i.e., 336.57 ms vs 142.62 ms), and can lead to as high as an 800-fold increase in the worst case. To effect our analysis, we develop a statistical model for churn based on empirical network data, and use this model to actuate the live test nodes on the Bitcoin network. The performance of the system is measured by means of a novel framework that we develop for logging the internal behavior of a Bitcoin node and share for public use.

AB In the current Bitcoin network, lightweight clients outsource most of the computational and storage tasks to full blockchain nodes in order to run on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. In the interactions with the full node, the lightweight client leaks considerable information about the Bitcoin transactions or addresses associated with this client. Therefore, the benefit of using lightweight client comes at costs of privacy. Existing solutions cannot support the lightweight client to retrieve the relevant transactions from the full node in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect the privacy of lightweight clients in Bitcoin. Our main idea is to use private information retrieval (PIR) to guarantee that the lightweight clients can fetch the relevant transactions from untrusted full nodes without revealing to those nodes which particular transactions are being fetched. Directly using existing PIR scheme incurs high communication overhead for lightweight clients. Therefore, we propose an optimized protocol utilizing two-step PIR to efficiently retrieve the queried transactions without leaking sensitive query information. We developed a prototype implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed scheme.

AB Blockchain technology and other distributed ledger systems fill an important role in resilient data storage and publication. However, their normally-decentralized methods also bring unique challenges distinct from more traditional approaches. One lies in the replication of data between participating nodes; since no individual node is more trusted than any other, each node maintains its own copy of the entire ledger for the purposes of validating new transactions. Improving how this information is stored and more importantly, how it propagates across the network, are open research questions. In this work, we propose Velocity, a novel block propagation approach based on fountain codes, allowing for better decentralized delivery of blocks and reduced network bottlenecks without sacrificing the security guarantees of the blockchain ledger itself. We also provide an assessment of economic incentives and their impact on participant behavior, showing that the proposed approach is financially beneficial to rational actors. We conclude by showing experimentally that this approach permits for the mining of even larger blocks, thereby increasing transaction throughput of the system compared to existing state of the art methods.

AB Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we re-architect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3,000 to 20,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.

DE Blockchain; eID; Government-issued electronic identities
AB Government IDs are traditionally plastic cards or paper-based passport booklets, sometimes with machine-readable contactless chips. Even though advanced implementations with cryptographic capabilities and online interfaces have been introduced, adoption and usage for online identification remain low. At the same time, there is a recognized need for trusted identities on the Internet, in Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering processes, and also in emerging blockchain-based, decentralized ecosystems. The contribution of this paper is a thorough analysis of the opportunities and state-of-the-art at the intersection of blockchain technology and government-issued electronical identity documents (eIDs), including existing implementations and pilots.

ID LAW
AB Among the characteristics of blockchain-based Smart Contracts, the aspect of irreversibility of blockchain transactions is one of the most controversially commented features from a legal perspective - taking into account that "traditional" contracts can be void or voidable for various reasons. But while there are indeed cases where existing private law concepts struggle to provide sound and predictable solutions to Smart Contract-induced problems, many of these controversies derive either from the use of disambiguous terminology in interdisciplinary communication, the diversity of the instrument of voidness and avoidance from a comparative perspective (and thus not the Smart Contract as such) or a general "misconception" of the irreversability of traditional forms of performance. This contribution intends to clarify where the irreversability of blockchain-based transactions does - against all odds - not make a difference compared to traditional contract law solutions, but also determines where legal conflicts indeed may arise from Smart Contracts and mistake.

ID AUTHENTICATION
AB Although the blockchain-based applications are considered to be less vulnerable due to the nature of the distributed ledger, they did not become the silver bullet with respect to securing the information against different security risks. In this paper, we present a literature review on the security risks that can be mitigated by introducing the blockchain technology, and on the security risks that are identified in the blockchain-based applications. In addition, we highlight the application and technology domains where these security risks are observed. The results of this study could be seen as a preliminary checklist of security risks when implementing blockchain-based applications.

AB Necessary energy policy targets trying to limit climate change effects are very ambitious. New technologies and combinations of available technologies are needed to achieve the goals by 2030/2050. A promising technology being explored in smart grids communications is the Blockchain, allowing peer-to-peer contractual-like or monetary-like interactions without the need for trust for an intermediary. This paper describes a Smart Grid Controller Blockchain Platform, allowing to simulate Virtual Power Plants communication along load profiles or smart meter measurement data. The communication requirements of these recent advances are similar to industrial cyber-physical systems, hence, applicable in other research domains.

AB Business processes in companies lead to an enormous number of event logs in their IT systems. Evaluating these event logs using data mining can provide companies with valuable process analysis information which can uncover process improvement potentials. However, media breaks frequently occur in these processes, so that there is a risk of optimizing isolated subprocesses only. Blockchain technology may avoid these media breaks and thus create the basis for complete event log analysis. The focus of our paper is to investigate existing requirements and to identify a blockchain based solution scenario evaluated by experts.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is making significant advances, especially in smart environments, but it still suffers from security issues and vulnerabilities. Hence, the security approach seems to be inappropriate for IoT-based workspaces due to the centralised architecture used by most connected objects. However, BlockChain (BC) is a technology that has been recently used to enhance security in mainly peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The main research goal of this study is to determine whether BC, IoT, and decentralised models can be used to secure Smart Learning Environments (SLEs). In this paper, we propose a new secure and reliable architecture for connected workspaces that eliminates the central intermediary, while preserving most of the security benefits. The system is investigated on an environment containing several connected sensors and uses the BC application, offering a hierarchical network that manages transactions and profits from the distributed trust method to enable a decentralised communication model. Finally, an evaluation is conducted to highlight the effectiveness in providing security for the novel system.

AB Currently, we are on the brink of a period of fundamental change for the healthcare expertise of specialists, i.e., existing know-how becomes less available to patients. One of the main reasons is an economic problem: most people and organisations cannot afford the services of first-rate professionals; and most economies are struggling to sustain their professional services, including schools, court systems, and health services. Another reason for the change in healthcare is the rapid growth of evidence-based medical knowledge, where a new research paper is published, on average, every forty-one seconds. Thus, evidence-based medicine is malfunctioning, and delayed, missed, and incorrect diagnoses occur in 10 to 20% of the time. Innovative IT technologies can solve the critical challenges in the healthcare domain. One of such technologies is smart contracts that manage and enforce contracts (business rules) without the interference of a third party. Smart contracts improve interoperability and privacy in cross-organisational processes. In this paper, we define problematic processes in healthcare and then provide a smart contract-based mapping for improving these processes. This paper proposes the way to overcome inequality in services accessibility, inefficient use of services and shortcomings in service quality, using smart contracts and blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain (BC) technology is a rather new conception of a mixed hardware and software platform to achieve distributed consensus among peers. Its diffusion is related to cryptocurrency, the most widespread of which is Bitcoin. The protocol on which BCs operate sees the interaction between users, interested in performing their transactions, and miners, who certify the trust behind the transactions by putting some form of effort that allows acknowledging their trustfulness, obtaining Bitcoins in reward for their work. In the so-called proof-of-work implementation of the BC, such effort is the computational power needed to find a specific string of bits called nonce. The resulting game-theoretic setting has subtle dynamics, and its functioning could be strongly improved using closed-loop control. This work is an attempt to define a control-oriented description of the agent-based BC dynamics and offer a redesign of the difficulty control system that regulates the amount of work needed to add a new trusted block to the BC. This control loop directly relates to the energy consumption of the overall system, which is one of the major drivers that will determine the future sustainability of the BC paradigm.

AB Research related to electric vehicles (EV) is mainly focused on the hardware such as battery charging method, and still there is a lack of software research such as billing system that needs to be developed realistically. The result of charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charged amount claimed to be charged in the charging system (CS). However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy delivery preferences of the CSs. In this paper, a novel EV participation charging scheme is proposed for a decentralized blockchain using smart contracts. Firstly, a permissioned blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Furthermore, based on the smart contract designed each EVs individual needs from CS is satisfied while maximizing its utility.

AB We present a path starting from generalized information measures to blockchain applications. In the middle of these two endpoints, we derive the alpha-EM algorithm and the traditional log-EM algorithm simultaneously from a sole divergence. Thus, there are three subjects. The first part discusses the relationship between the Bregman divergence and the probabilistic alpha-divergence. There, a new alpha-divergence is derived from the Bregman divergence by skewing the probability space. In the second part, both the alpha-EM algorithm and the traditional log-EM algorithm are derived simultaneously from this single divergence. The third part is on the applications to the blockchain. The EM families are effective in statistical machine learning that can be incorporated in miners of blockchains for evaluating the data sent from clients. Any miner appreciates the speed in order to contest with other miners. The alpha-EM matches this purpose because of its faster speed than the log-EM. As a concrete application, we present the wine sommelier evaluation. This formulation using the multinomial mixture distribution can be applicable to a wider class of IoT data that fly on the network.

AB We suggest a general framework for network-coded Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus for enabling agreement among distributed nodes under Byzantine attacks. The suggested protocol generalizes existing replication and sharding schemes which are frequently used for consensus in current blockchain systems. Using the proposed algorithm, it is possible to reach a consensus when the available bandwidth is considerably smaller on individual links compared to that required for conventional schemes. It is shown that there exists an upper bound on the number of nodes that can participate in the protocol, given a maximum bandwidth constraint across all pairwise links. Furthermore, the protocol that achieves the upper bound is provided by using a set of constant weight codes.

AB The 3XORSUM problem aims to find (x, y,z) such that x + y + z = 0 over {0,1}(d); with each variable drawn from one of 3 randomly generated lists. In addition to being of interest in its own right, this problem has cryptographic applications including proof of stake methods in Blockchain.
   The 3XORSUM problem is also related to the integer 3SUM problem from theoretical computer science on which there is extensive recent literature. It is conjectured that the integer 3SUM problem has complexity (Omega) over tilde (n(2)) for lists of size O(n).
   Wagner [10] has presented an algorithm with complexity (O) over tilde (2(d/3)) for finding a 4XORSUM solution (x + y + z + w = 0) with each variable drawn from one of 4 randomly generated lists of size O(2(d/3)) with members from {0,1}(d).
   We present an algorithm which solves the 3XORSUM problem for randomly generated binary vectors from {0,1}(d) with time and memory complexity (O) over tilde (n) = (O) over tilde (2(d/3)). This substantially improves results from [1], [8]. Our algorithm has applications to blockchains and other cryptographic problems.

AB This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.

AB Traditional payment systems have standards designed to keep transaction data secure, but blockchain systems are not in scope for such security standards. We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard's (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard's applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms' industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM's and Ethereum's capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard's results. Finally, we discuss open research issues.

AB The primary aim of this work is to create a program simulating a private distributed blockchain using the functional programming language Idris. This simulation is implemented such that a rock-paper-scissors game can be played between any two users of the blockchain via the use of smart contracts. Our motivation is to assert, using relevant features of Idris, that such an implementation possesses some of the accepted properties of blockchains. This paper first presents some differences between our implementation and most real-world blockchains. Next the Idris language and some of its features are discussed, focusing on how the language is used to implement the simulation. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing Idris instead of an imperative programming language are examined.

AB This article has developed a structural equation model, aimed at evaluating the impact factors on people?s holding intention of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created by the Blockchain technology. Specifically, this study directs its attention on the Bitcoin holder's perceived value and risk, the moderating effects of gender, income, age, and the experience of digital token provided by the respondents. The conclusions are: (1) The majority of individuals do not have any understanding of the values or risks of Bitcoin; (2) The more transaction and speculative risks of Bitcoin people perceive, the less government intervention they are expected to have. Nevertheless, even if government intervention is necessary, it would not impact their holding intention; (3) The higher value of Bitcoin people perceive, the more government intervention people would prefer. Despite this preference, people's holding intention remains intact. However, its degree of influence is definitely less conspicuous than the above effect of the second conclusion; and (4) The government advocacy about the values and risks of Bitcoin should be differentiated by the more nuanced factors such as gender, income, the experience of digital token usage, and age of users, in order to obtain an effective regulation of Bitcoin.

AB Based on the analysis of trends and threats of digital transformation of global banking, we concluded that there is an unevenness of digitization of banking in different regions. The development of digital technology has an impact on the global banking market, its structure and services. Cloud technology, blockchain and Big Data, artificial intelligence, biometrics, and open source APIs are used by financial institutions both in routine client work (optical character recognition, language, voice, customer image and face recognition, etc.), and in complex analysis of unstructured data sets (pattern recognition in money laundering transactions, counter-terrorism financing). The major segments where the biggest changes were made - are retail, corporate banking, payments, bank transactions, investment banking, and infrastructure projects. There are considered the concept of open banking, its impact on the ecosystem of financial market. The use of digital technologies, on the one hand, increases competition and market efficiency, and on the other, creates new systemic risks to financial stability and integrity.
   The main obstacles to digital transformation are not technological ones, but the differences in the organizational culture of traditional banks and fintech, different strategic vision of top management, lack of qualified personnel, which makes it difficult for banks to transform for cooperation. The use of digital technology increases the systemic risks associated with cyber security, fraud and ethical issues. In order to reduce the fraud, it is important to improve the verification procedures: the integration of offline and online modes, the use of implicit factors, and consumer biometric behaviour. Given the likelihood of recession in the coming years, geopolitical problems, trade and currency wars, traditional banks need to transform their businesses in line with new trends. In modern global world, there are not the largest banks that the competitive advantages get but the ones that are the most adapted to changes.

AB The advent of cryptocurrencies and rapid growth of crypto-networks heralded a new era in evolution of financial relations. The main goals achieved by introduction of cryptocurrencies included: a) removal of the third party (the government, banking and financial institutions) from transactions between the parties to a transfer; b) anonymity of the parties; c) transaction security. The governments of various countries of the world have a different stance as regards the use of cryptocurrencies, and in some cases, they consider this medium of exchange illegal. The transnational nature of transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the absence of physical borders for these transactions complicate legislative regulation of the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine.
   The use of cryptocurrencies has significant effect on the economies of Ukraine and other countries of the world due to easy dissemination and popularity of this technology and the growing capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The exchange of cryptocurrencies into fiduciary money and the possibility of gaining substantial profits on a cryptocurrency exchange due to high volatility of cryptocurrencies necessitate development, as soon as possible, of approaches to legislative regulation of both terminological apparatus related to circulation of cryptocurrencies and the exchange transaction procedures, profit taxation, etc. Considering the multisided nature of crypto-networks and the diversity of cryptocurrencies currently existing in the world (over 2000 variants as of today), classification of existing cryptocurrencies and definition of their features represents a contemporary task.
   This article characterizes development of blockchain technology that serves as the basis for the functioning of cryptocurrencies, defines their characteristic features, positive and innovative concepts implemented with their advent. Cryptocurrencies were classified based on various criteria (issue type, network decentralization, limitation on issue, controllability of cryptocurrency issue, etc.), and two groups of features typical either for all cryptocurrencies or for their certain variants were proposed. It was proposed to define a cryptocurrency as a variety of e-money used as an alternative additional currency and circulated within global computer networks on the basis of blockchain technology that envisages asymmetrical encryption and the use of various cryptographic protection methods.

AB Blockchain is an enabler of many emerging decentralized applications in areas of cryptocurrency, Internet of Things, smart health-care, among many others. Although various open-source blockchain frameworks are available in the form of virtual machine images or docker images on public clouds, the infrastructure of mainstream blockchains nonetheless exhibits a technical barrier for many users to modify or test out new research ideas in blockchains. To make it worse, many advantages of blockchain systems can be demonstrated only at large scales, e.g., thousands of nodes, which are not always available to researchers. This paper presents an accurate and efficient emulating system to replay the execution of large-scale blockchain systems on tens of thousands of nodes. In contrast to existing work that simulates blockchains with artificial timestamp injection, the proposed system is designed to be executing real proof-of-work workload along with peer-to-peer network communications and hash-based immutability. In addition, the proposed system employs a preprocessing approach to avoid the per-node computation overhead at runtime and thus achieves practical scales. We have evaluated the system for emulating up to 20,000 nodes on Amazon Web Services (AWS), showing both high accuracy and high efficiency with millions of transactions.

AB The banking system is of paramount importance for a market economy, because thanks to banks, the function of an intermediary is performed, and financial resources are distributed among the business entities. A key element of the banking system is its infrastructure. Banking is recognized as a commercial activity, that is, aimed at obtaining a certain profit, therefore the main, fundamental characteristic of its activity is the effective use of assets. Consequently, as long as there are banks and banking operations, there will always be topical tasks of braving the bank's infrastructure, and today digitalization.

AB Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) evidence have become an important evidentiary focus in the courtroom. This type of evidence is routinely produced as business records under U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence for use in the emerging discipline of Forensic Cell Site Analysis. The research was undertaken to determine if evidence produced by operators should be classified as digital evidence and, if so, what evidence handling methodologies are appropriate to ensure evidence integrity. This research project resulted in the creation of a method of determining if business records produced by MNO/MVNO organizations are digital evidence and whether evidentiary integrity is maintained in the conveyance of evidence between MNO/MVNO records custodians, law enforcement investigators and attorneys in criminal and civil cases. Block-chain based Distributed Ledger Technology was examined as a feasible evidence integrity maintenance solution.

AB The relationship between knowledge management and innovation has been one of the most explored topics in management studies for many years. In contemporary organizations these two topics became associated with digital technologies. The introduction of computers and related digital technologies has been changing the way knowledge is managed in organizations, but digital innovation itself was imposing new requirements on what knowledge organization must possess to innovate and stay modern. Blockchain have recently emerged as paradigm-breaking technology, thus potentially requiring novel skills and knowledge from the adopting or innovating company.
   The main purpose of this research is to conduct exploratory literature review in the field of economics, finance and management to in order to map the frequencies of topics related to blockchain application in organizations. Obtained findings provide an overview of what aspects and kinds of the nascent technology is being researched. The findings can help an innovating company better understand the current trends with respect to the development and adoption of the novel technology. This research also establishes a foundation for further analysis of skillsets and organizational knowledge required for blockchain-related innovations in organizations.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Sustainable and socially responsible investment (SRI) strategies face high growth rates worldwide. Although SRI strategies gained high amounts of assets under management over the last years, we do not recognize a significant shift towards sustainable business practices. The research aim of this paper is to give an answer to the question, why the high amount of assets managed sustainably does not lead to a significant transformation in business practices and how we could change the existing framework in order to achieve significant changes. Our methodological approach first leads us to a comparison of the existing seven sustainable investment strategies and a description of financial instruments, connected with those strategies. Second, we collect decision criteria and goals for supply side and demand side market participants. Finally, we use this preparatory work for the construction of a decision matrix, which allows us to interpret differences in goal fulfilments.
   This analysis delivers insights into the connection between sustainable investment strategies, preferences of supply side and demand side institutions, and the low speed of transformation. Up to now, no research on the connection between sustainable investment strategies and the speed of transformation towards sustainability has been done. Our results focus cost disadvantages of impact investing compared to other sustainable investment strategies. A stronger standardisation of impact investing's private debt and private equity structures is needed. The legislator could favour impact investing to other investment strategies, as current law is based on less efficient investment strategies. A blockchain application could additionally drive down the costs and increase the flexibility of impact investing.

AB "Blockchain", "distributed ledger" and "smart contract" are terms that were anonymous only a decade ago, but today they are increasingly aggressive present in our daily lives. The financial industry is one of the areas in which the implementation of blockchain technology is reasonably expected to lead to dramatic changes. The time of the initial euphoria is gone, giving way to realism and "sobering" of the illusions about the possibilities and limitations to the feasibility of the new technology. The main research goal of the present study is systematization and testing using selected criteria, to arrive at a differentiated assessment of the degree of applicability of blockchain in different segments of the financial services industry. The methodological tools used are based on literature review and secondary data, through which the expected positioning of blockchain in the financial industry in line with the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies is explored. Based on the analysis of the specificities of the selected segments of the financial industry and the comparative analysis of the benefits and limitations in the development and application of the technology, the criteria for assessing the degree of applicability and the expected impact of blockchain technology on the analyzed segments are systematized. The results of the study testify to the uneven level of impact and penetration of blockchain in various spheres of the financial industry. The main challenges and barriers to the application of the technology and the possible solutions for overcoming them are outlined.

AB Smart contracts are transactional scripts on the top of the blockchain technology that are created for executing and enforcing legal contracts. Self-executable they check contractual pre-defined conditions and automatically fulfil respective actions or transactions, respectively. Through this form of automation, the layers of middlemen can be reduced or even completely replaced. Accordingly, smart contracts bear the potential to decrease transaction and enforcement costs. In addition to this narrow obvious characteristic, we argue that smart contracts encase the potential to foster entrepreneurial collaborations of cross-organisational business processes and enabling trans-national networks of entrepreneurs and SMEs to enter into new business sectors which are currently still closed due to high entry barriers or to domination of big players. Especially, the logistics sector is well-known for dominating global players that try to limit entrepreneurial activities of small companies by using closed organisational structures and dedicated IT systems. The foundation and the organisational support for entrepreneurial collaborations in such logistics-related networks can be realised by the implementation of decentralized autonomous organisations based on blockchain technology and smart contracting. Accordingly, this paper discusses the research question how smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable trans-national entrepreneurial activities in logistics networks. Our research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies from several EU projects with a focus on the ongoing project "Connect2SmallPorts". The research results will showcase and assess this potential of using smart contracting in the case of charter-parties.

AB In order to help track and disclose environmental performance across the textile and apparel supply chain, DLT is proposed as an ideal tool for information storage and communication in a highly transparent network. Every participant in the network can get access to the information for supply chain process, and eventually build a high level of trust on suppliers' environmental governance. This paper aims to bring out the potential of DLT technology on the textile and apparel supply chain. We discuss how to utilize the unique characteristics of DLT for achieving low carbon emissions during textile and apparel manufacturing through better supply chain transparency. In details, an overview of DLT technology is provided in this paper by showing the design, business implications and opportunities in the textile and apparel supply chain. In addition, a case study is illustrated on DLT technology in the textile and apparel supply chain transparency for World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)'s Low Carbon Manufacturing Programme (LCMP).

AB A disruptive revolution is forming for the blockchain based communication network framework with end-to-end P2P based architecture of distributed computation, storage, and networking paradigm - the Next Generation Blockchain Network (NGBN). The core theme of NGBN is to push up communication PHY layer and push down application layer (e.g. storage and computation) to converge on a single networking layer - called Blockchain Network Layer (BNL) - such that blockchain token economy can be efficiently implemented to support an end-to-end P2P mesh network with unlimitedly scalable, available to everyone, and expandable by peer nodes' joining openly, robust and secure network environment for all the IoT, big data, AI applications to be coming in the next 10 years. To achieve this goal, a joint effort is needed to pull together various resources, including network resources, communication resources, application and chip level support, software and system, and initial proof of concept trials for the end-to-end deployment.

AB The blockchain uses a decentralized consensus mechanism to maintain the books in an immutable way, which ensures the blockchain smart contract system highly secure. In existing blockchain systems, all user information is disclosed in the blockchain. However, currently users begin to pay more and more attention to personal privacy, therefore the future blockchain smart contract system needs not only to keep immutability but also to protect user privacy. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose a Privacy-Protected Blockchain System, where all data is encrypted within a controllable period of time. Although the data is visible from a historical perspective, our design can effectively protect user privacy and against deceivers, making the system more secure and healthy.

AB With the improvement of people's dietary structure, low-calorie rice food is more and more popular with consumers. Rice quality traits mainly include fat content, fatty acid composition, protein content and amino acid composition. The average content of essential amino acids in rice was 7.3%, accounting for 28.4% of total amino acids. In this paper, the authors analyze the fatty protein nutrition of rice and application of block chain in three rural areas. By combining the technical characteristics of block chain with traditional agricultural production, agricultural intellectualization based on block chain technology can be built to ensure the accuracy, uniqueness and traceability of information, such as accurate identification of poverty alleviation households. At the same time, through the combination of artificial intelligence technology, we can predict the growth trend of crops, intelligently optimize the planting process, and thus build an intelligent agricultural service system.

TI Mediatized Rituals: Understanding the Media in the Age of Deep
   Mediatization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION

DT Article
DE mediatized ritual; deep mediatization; networked access;

ID TECHNOLOGIES; BLOCKCHAIN
AB In this article, I propose the concept of mediatized ritual as a conceptual update to media events and media rituals. With this concept, I intend to better address the ritualistic orientation that privileges an increasingly mediatized social reality constructed through algorithmic collection, processing, and (re)presentation of data and metadata by communication technologies. I argue that to understand mediatized ritual, the media must be understood not as genres or media institutions, but as (1) the technological affordance and human practices of networked access to information and (2) the social perception of tamper-resistance of information, which construct the social reality in a mediatized manner. Blockchain technology and its social nature are analyzed as an example of the utility of the concept. The sociological implications regarding rituals, trust, normalcy, and power-relationship are also discussed.

AB This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments in the framework of the scientific discussion on determining priority directions of developing banking systems, modern problems and prospects of introduction of financial innovations in the process of development of banking services. Its pace and current trends require a completely scientific basis. Accordingly, the purpose of the study is to determine the impact of modern information technology in the banking systems of the European Union countries and the future prospects for their development. For this purpose, the hypothesis was, first of all, proposed that the level of business activity of the banking activity is related to the level of development of the country's economy and it will determine in the future the development of the banking systems of these countries. An appropriate empirical study was conducted to confirm this hypothesis. The systematization of literary sources and approaches to the solution of this problem has shown that in scientific sources the analysis of the impact of financial innovations on the banking systems of individual European Union countries is mainly carried out. Taking into account the different levels of development of these countries, these studies do not allow us to make conclusions and suggestions as to the future of European banks. Electronic banking, the creation of a large number of fi tech companies, crypto volume, blockade - radically change the classical banking business. These changes are gaining momentum and the future of the banking system is now very ambiguous. Will classical banks be able to function effectively, or will new financial companies come to their place? What should I do to manage the bank to lay the groundwork for its successful operation, in the context of the rapid development of information technology? Who and how will regulate global financial markets? There are no clear answers to these questions. The methodical toolkit of the study was a clustering method, methods of systematization, grouping, comparison, expert evaluations. The study period covers 2015-2018, which shows the most rapid dynamics of changes in the processes of customer service of banks from the offline to the online sphere. In addition, this period of time is characterized by the rapid development of financial innovation, which radically changes the approaches to traditional banking activities.
   The article presents the results of cluster analysis, the results of which allowed to group the countries of the European Union at different levels of digitalization. As a result, it was found that the most advanced economies and the most developed countries have the highest level of deductibility of banking activity (related to clusters 2 and 1). As a higher level of economic development provides more opportunities for investment, Internet access and better education of the population. In addition, it can be argued that it is the countries from the first group in the near future will or will become leaders in the European market of banking services, and it is on them that they will need to be guided by the orientation of the development of the banking system. The results of empirical analysis, have shown that banking institutions understand the lack of prospects of activities without financial innovation. On the other hand, as the study showed, such activity is characterized by high-risk banks. The issue of safety of up-to-date financial transactions is extremely important for supervisors who can not at the moment agree on what measures to apply and implement in order to minimize the risks of financial transactions. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that it is important to understand and justify the basic principles of the future development of banks, to identify and develop measures to minimize the levels of financial risks associated with the implementation of financial innovations, as well as to simply understand and evaluate changes expected by users of banking services during the next 5 to 10 years. The results of the research can be useful for scientists, management of banking and other financial institutions, as well as for users of banking services.

AB After several decades of rapid development, South Korea has recently experienced a critical economic downturn. The paper considers the prerequisites for the current state-of-the-art, as well as the new economic policy agenda aimed at fostering innovation in various sectors, thereby suggesting improved policy directions. To implement the innovation-driven policy, the Korean government produced the framework for the Innovative Platform. Programme (IPP), which covers a wide range of sectors related to Industry 4.0 like artificial intelligence and blockchain. For the IPP to be successful, the authors believe, it is vital to understand and resolve the trade-offs between contradictory policy priorities - innovation-led growth, income-led growth, and a fair economy.

AB Traditional construction supply chains suffer from extra delays, costs and information wastages due to information intermediaries. Blockchain, a decentralized infrastructure, can provide irreversibility, undeniableness, uniqueness and anonymity for trades. Hence, we first propose a blockchain-based construction supply chain framework to reduce limitations in traditional ones. However, payment security by blockchain must be guaranteed and token assets in accounts must be protected. Although the loss of private keys will not result in the exposure or the modification of records in blockchain due to merkle root and blockheader hash, fake payments can be generated and all tokens in the accounts controlled by the private keys may be stolen by attackers. Existing approaches towards private-key protections include biometric-basic signature schemes, index-hidden private key designs and post-quantum blockchain schemes. Nevertheless, none of them can recover lost private keys. Therefore, we design a private-key distribution protocol in blockchains to preserve security of private keys with key recovery. Specifically, our scheme not only uses secret sharing to improve possibilities of recovering lost keys but also introduces network protocols to guarantee security of secret share transmission. The proposed scheme is then proven secure and feasible both in theoretical and experimental analysis.

AB 5G is the next generation cellular network that aspires to achieve substantial improvement on quality of service, such as higher throughput and lower latency. Edge computing is an emerging technology that enables the evolution to 5G by bringing cloud capabilities near to the end users (or user equipment, UEs) in order to overcome the intrinsic problems of the traditional cloud, such as high latency and the lack of security. In this paper, we establish a taxonomy of edge computing in 5G, which gives an overview of existing state-of-the-art solutions of edge computing in 5G on the basis of objectives, computational platforms, attributes, 5G functions, performance measures, and roles. We also present other important aspects, including the key requirements for its successful deployment in 5G and the applications of edge computing in 5G. Then, we explore, highlight, and categorize recent advancements in edge computing for 5G. By doing so, we reveal the salient features of different edge computing paradigms for 5G. Finally, open research issues are outlined.

AB Today more and more enterprises and individuals are outsourcing their data to cloud storage system. Data deduplication is one of the important technologies to reduce the storage cost of cloud storage system. In a cloud storage system with deduplication technology, the client can outsource the data files to the cloud storage server and pay for them. Fair payment is one of key issues in the cloud deduplication storage system. At present, a variety of secure deduplication encryption schemes have been designed to protect the privacy of client data. However, most existing fair payment solutions use traditional electronic cash systems to generate payment tokens, which requires a trusted authority to prevent double-spending. Trusted authorities will become bottlenecks in the payment system. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new decentralized fair payment protocol for cloud deduplication storage system by utilizing ethereum blockchain technology. The new protocol takes advantage of the decentralization of blockchain technology, allowing direct transactions without the participation of trusted third parties. In the new protocol, if a malicious situation occurs, the system can guarantee fair payment by pre-storing penalty money in the smart contract. Safety analysis and experimental analysis show that our new protocol is feasible.

TI Two-Phase Cooperative Bargaining Game Approach for Shard-Based
   Blockchain Consensus Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS

   egalitarian bargaining solution; proportional bargaining solution
AB In the last few years, blockchain technologies have come to the forefront of the research and industrial communities as they bring potential benefits for many industries. Even though the blockchain is a safe, reliable, and innovative mechanism, current blockchain solutions have fatal drawbacks of non-supervision and huge computational overhead. Therefore, they cannot be directly applied for real world operations. To resolve this problem, a novel model is presented in this study where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple shards while processing them in parallel. To achieve the maximum system efficiency through the shard mechanism, we focus on the cooperative game theory. Based on the egalitarian bargaining solution, total transactions per each time period are divided for each shard. According to the proportional bargaining solution, assigned transactions in each individual shard are validated by blockchain nodes in a distributed manner. The main advantage of our two-phase bargaining game model is to provide an axiom-based strategic solution for the shard-based consensus problem while dynamically responding to the current blockchain network conditions. The numerical simulation results show that the effectiveness and efficiency of our game based approach by comparing the existing state-of-the-art blockchain control schemes. In the conclusion, we present our conclusions and provide important future research directions based on the combination of blockchain with other technologies.

AB Institutional design is a targeted change to the system of socio-economic institutions. This concept is widely used in English-language literature, also sometimes in Russian-language publications. In economics, institutional design processes include the establishment of rules for the use of public resources, the implementation of economic reforms, the creation and reform of economic organizations that significantly affect relations between groups of economic agents, etc. From the many publications in which the processes of institutional design are discussed, the author, using databases such as google scholar, elibrary. ru and search sites, selected for analysis those where the application of mathematical models and calculations takes place. Some of them do not contain the term "institutional design", but contain its synonyms or describe particular cases of its application. This article suggests the classification of mathematical models used in these publications. Among them are econometric models, models of general economic equilibrium, econophysical models involving the application in economics of the methods of the theory of nonlinear dynamic systems, models of game theory (in particular, evolutionary game theory and game theory related to the collective use of resources), and imitation models. Examples of publications about specific types of models are given. The strengths and weaknesses of the use of various types of models and mathematical methods are indicated and the prospects for their use are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the use of information technology in institutional design, which is actively developing due to the presence of the Internet and large computing power, as well as the development and adoption of blockchain technology by society.

AB Outsourced data, as significant service offered by the cloud service provider (CSP), can effectively facilitate the data owner (DO) overcoming the storage limitations on massive data. To ensure the availability of data, DO usually outsources the data replications to multiple CSPs (multi-CSPs) and utilizes a third party metadata management (TPMM) to dominate the metadata of the corresponding replications. However, during the outsourced procedures, DO can hardly confirm the confidence of the TPMM who may take some malicious behaviors to affect the reliability of data. Thus, DO inevitably faces data security issues caused by the over-reliance on the semi-trusted TPMM to manage the metadata of replications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of reliable outsourced data service among multi-CSPs in untrusted environment, that is, how to reliably store and verify the metadata of the data replications in untrusted multi-CSPs environment. To address the problem, we use the novel blockchain technology as a medium to build a trusted outsourced service platform. Moreover, we fully consider the innovative characteristics of blockchain including decentralized architecture, redundancy storage, collective maintenance, and tamper resistant to ensure the data cannot be changed maliciously. We first design a blockchain-based outsourced service framework for storing data replications in untrusted environment, which contains three key layers, that is, storage layer, verification layer, and blockchain layer. Then, we devise a novel concept of verification peer (VP) for maintaining metadata stored by a form of blockchain, and each of which holds the entire blockchain locally to prevent metadata from being maliciously tampered with. Finally, based on the proposed model, we introduce a collaborative algorithm invoked by VPs to store and verify the metadata of replications. We present a completed analysis and conduct extensive experiments on multi-CSPs scenario. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance.

AB Food traceability has been one of the emerging blockchain applications in recent years, for improving the areas of anti-counterfeiting and quality assurance. Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation.

TI Compliance of Electronic Bill of Lading Regulation in Korea with Model
   Law on Electronic Transferable Records
SO JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE

DT Article
DE Model Law; Electronic Transferable Records; Electronic Bill of Lading;
   Bill of Lading; Control; Korean Commercial Act
AB Purpose -The UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (Model Law) is based on the principles of non-discrimination against the use of electronic means, functional equivalence, and technology neutrality underpinning all UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce. Investigating the disagreements between the Model Law and the Koran Commercial Act (KC Act), including the B/ L Regulation, and suggesting the revision of the KC Act including the B/ L Regulation, could be a valuable study. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the harmonization of Korean legislation regarding electronic bill of lading in compliance with the Model Law. Design/ methodology -The Model Law is flexible to accommodate the use of all technologies and models, such as registries, tokens, and distributed ledgers: that is, blockchain. In 2007, the KC Act was revised to regulate electronic bills of lading to promote the widespread legal use of electronic bills of lading. In addition, The Regulation on Implementation of the Provisions of the Commercial Act Regarding Electronic Bills of Lading (the B/ L Regulation) was enacted to regulate the detailed procedures in using electronic bills of lading in 2008. This paper employs a legal analysis by which this paper does find differences between two rules in light of technology neutrality and global standard of electronic bills of lading model. Findings -The main findings are as follows: i) the Korean registry agency has characteristics of a closed system. ii) The KC Act has no provision regarding control. iii) The KC Act discriminates other electronic bills of lading on the ground that it was issued or used abroad. Moreover, this study does comprehensive analysis of Korean Acts in comparison with the Model Law and, in particular, this study analyzes the differences between the KC Act and the Model Law by comparing article by article in view of the harmonization of the two rules. Originality/ value -The subject of previous several studies was draft provisions on Electronic Transferable Records before completion of the Model Law; thus, these studies did not take into consideration the character of the Model Law as the Model Law was chosen at the final stage of legislation. This study is aimed at the final version of the Model Law. So, this study is meaningful by finding the suggestion and directions for the Korean government to revise the KC Act and the B/ L Regulation in line with the Model Law.

AB Iranian philosopher Reza Negarestani's first 2008 book Cyclonopedia was written under the influence of Nick Land's nihilistic and antihumanist philosophy which seeks to critique anthropomorphism by confronting us with our coming extinction beyond which our concepts of reason cannot reach. Since Cyclonopedia's publication, however, Negarestani has left behind Landian nihilism to develop in his 2018 book Intelligence and Spirit a neorationalist philosophy of mind whose primary influences are Sellars, Brandom, and Hegel. At 579 clearly written yet dense pages, it is difficult even for a review article to encapsulate the book in its entirety. The first half of this article instead aims to provide a sense of the book's overall project by focusing on how Negarestani outlines and develops his neorationalist philosophy through a critique of Land's antihumanism.
   Never one to remain silent whilst others seek to resurrect Hegel from the dead, since December 2018, Land has been releasing a draft on his blog Urban Futures 2.1 of his new monograph Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy, which proffers the most up to date articulation of his main antihumanist tenets. Having organized Intelligence and Spirit around Negarestani's objections to Land, this article's second half turns to Crypto-Current to see how Land is able to provide convincing responses to each of Negarestani's objections, showing some to be based on strawman characterizations, others to stem from misunderstandings of Land's position, and still others to lack traction at all. By putting Negarestani and Land's new books in combat, we will ultimately see that the grounds for Negarestani's efforts to move continental philosophy from its Kanto-Landian phase to a renewed Hegelian phase is unsuccessful in that antihumanism is able to respond to each of his objections in kind.

TI A Blockchain-Based Privacy-Awareness Authentication Scheme With

AB Multi-server authentication technology has become more and more popular with the extensive applications of networks. Although it has brought great convenience to people's life, security becomes a critical issue and attracts lots of attentions in both academia and industry. Over the past two decades, a series of multi-server authentication schemes without communication with the online registration center in each authentication phase using the self-certified public key cryptography have been proposed to enhance security. However, it may cause the single-point failure problem due to the centralized architecture. Besides, user revocation facility is not well resolved in these schemes. To the best of our knowledge, blockchain technology has lots of advantages, bringing a promising solution to the problems of single-point failure and user revocation compared with the traditional cryptography technologies. In this work, we apply the idea of blockchain technology to construct a privacy-awareness authentication scheme for the multi-server environment, which can achieve distributed registry and efficient revocation. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only provides multiple security requirements like mutual authentication, user anonymity and perfect forward secrecy, but also resists various kinds of malicious attacks. The security of the proposed scheme is proved by rigorous formal proof using the random oracle model. Compared with recently related schemes, the proposed scheme has better communication performance, which make it be very suitable for real-life applications.

AB This paper researches the building principles and administration of virtual data processing centers based on hyper-converged systems over Open Flow. We provide the implementation features of such virtual centers on the basis of software-defined networking that is managed by a dedicated controller (a server). We suggest the graph administration model of hyper-converged system resources compliant with required performance on the one hand and economic requirements on the other. Based on the proposed model, the implementation of a greedy control algorithm for the virtual data processing center over OpenFlow was examined. This algorithm assigns the requests to physical resources by using of dedicated server software. The advantages of such hyper-converged system model on performance issues were outlined, e.g., multi-threaded routing and security, elimination of the majority of current threats. We summarize the possibilities of transition to network infrastructure in these virtual data processing centers. Such infrastructure is focused on data and usage of blockchain technology providing high reliability and content protection.

AB Trajectory data has been widely used in many urban applications. Sharing trajectory data with effective supervision is a vital task, as it contains private information of moving objects. However, malicious data users can modify trajectories in various ways to avoid data distribution tracking by the hashing-based data signatures, e.g., MD5. Moreover, the existing trajectory data protection scheme can only protect trajectories from either spatial or temporal modifications. Finally, so far there is no authoritative third party for trajectory data sharing process, as trajectory data is too sensitive.
   To this end, we propose a novel trajectory copyright protection scheme, which can protect trajectory data from comprehensive types of data modifications/attacks. Three main techniques are employed to effectively guarantee the robustness and comprehensiveness of the proposed data sharing scheme: 1) the identity information is embedded distributively across a set of sub-trajectories partitioned based on the spatio-temporal regions; 2) the centroid distance of the sub-trajectories is served as a stable trajectory attribute to embed the information; and 3) the blockchain technique is used as a trusted third party to log all data transaction history for data distribution tracking in a decentralized manner. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world trajectory datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

ID RECORD LINKAGE
AB Background: Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data analytics. With the explosion of stored health data (HD), dental medicine is edging into its fourth stage of digitization using artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative literature review outlines the challenge of managing HD and anticipating the potential of AI in oral healthcare and dental research by summarizing the current literature. Summary: The basis of successful management of HD is the establishment of a generally accepted data standard that will guide its implementation within electronic health records (EHR) and health information technology ecosystems (HIT Eco). Thereby continuously adapted (self-) learning health systems (LHS) can be created. The HIT Eco of the future will combine (i) the front-end utilization of HD in clinical decision-making by providers using supportive diagnostic tools for patient-centered treatment planning, and (ii) back-end algorithms analyzing the standardized collected data to inform population-based policy decisions about resource allocations and research directions. Cryptographic methods in blockchain enable a safe, more efficient, and effective dental care within a global perspective. Key Message: The interoperability of HD with accessible digital health technologies is the key to deliver value-based dental care and exploit the tremendous potential of AI.

DE blockchain; data extraction; education; student's profile
AB Blockchain technology offers advantages such as integrity, anonymity, credibility and independence of the institution and time because of its decentralized nature. One of the current areas for tackling challenges and potential application of blockchain technology is education. Higher education is a complex system with various challenges that could be potentially improved by introducing this technology. This paper shows a brief overview of current systems, their current state and a direction of their development, but also proposes specific guidelines and upgrades for current systems, that would enhance them and, consequently, the area of education. It also proposes blockchain integration levels in higher education that, combined with data extraction, can expand and deepen the area of education for the benefit of institutions, employers and students.

DE Blockchain; Ethereum; Smart contract; distrubuted data sharing
AB In this paper, we propose to use the blockchain technology as a mechanism to store and share geospatial projects. Blockchain helps to improve efficiency and security. Smart contracts provide a secure, distributed and shared decentralized ledger of all assets and transactions. We will discuss a way to implement a platform on which scientists can share their studies. We propose a design methodology for the mentioned smart contracts, which enables the development of different use cases using blockchain technology. A detailed design of the smart contracts, functions and processes is presented. We will provide an outline of advantages and limitations of blockchain in general, and for the proposed platform.

AB Ethereum is a decentralized Blockchain system that supports the execution of Turing-complete smart contracts. Although the security of the Ethereum ecosystem has been studied in the past, the network layer has been mostly neglected. We show that Go Ethereum (Geth), the most widely used Ethereum implementation, is currently vulnerable to eclipse attacks, effectively circumventing recently introduced security enhancements(1). Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of the Blockchain. We discuss fundamental properties of Geth's node discovery logic that enable the false friends attack, and propose countermeasures.

DE Ethereum; ERC20 tokens; Blockchain
AB Custom tokens are an integral component of decentralized applications (dapps) deployed on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. For Ethereum, the ERC20 standard is a widely used token interface and is interoperable with many existing dapps, user interface platforms, and popular web applications (e.g., exchange services). An ERC20 security issue, known as the multiple withdrawal attack, was raised on GitHub and has been open since October 2017. The issue concerns ERC20's defined method approve() which was envisioned as a way for token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped number of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to adjust the amount of approved tokens from N to M (this could be an increase or decrease). If malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for N tokens can front-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw N tokens, then allow the approval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional M tokens. In this paper, we evaluate 10 proposed mitigations for this issues and find that no solution is fully satisfactory. We then propose 2 new solutions that mitigate the attack, one of which fully fulfills constraints of the standard, and the second one shows a general limitation in addressing this issue from ERC20's approve method.

AB This work(1) studies the problem of automatically penalizing intentional or unintentional data breach (APB) by a receiver/custodian receiving confidential data from a sender. We solve this problem for multimedia data by augmenting a blockchain on-chain smart contract between the sender and receiver with an off-chain cryptographic protocol, such that any significant data breach from the receiver is penalized through a monetary loss. Towards achieving the goal, we use an oblivious transfer scheme when used with a robust watermarking and a claim-or-refund blockchain contract provides the necessary framework to realize the APB protocol in a provably secure manner. In our APB protocol, a public data breach by the receiver leads to her Bitcoin (or other blockchain) private signing key getting revealed to the sender, which allows him to penalize the receiver by claiming the deposit from the claim-or-refund contract. Interestingly, the protocol also ensures that the malicious sender cannot steal the deposit, even as he knows the original multimedia document or releases it in any form.

AB Smart contracts allow for exchange of coins according to program rules. While it is well known that so called bribery contracts can influence the incentive mechanism of a Nakamoto-style consensus, we present a more fine-grained bribery attack incentivizing a temporary censorship against a specific account. To this end, we introduce three different bribery contracts on the blockchain where each uniquely manipulates the rewards that a rational miner would receive. Additionally, we formalize the established bribery mechanisms as a Markov game and show for each game the existence of equilibria leading to successful censorships. Finally, we compare the bribery mechanisms with respect to the scalability of the attack costs and the strategic dominance. Our work is motivated by off-chain protocols including payment and state channels which require to publish transactions within a certain amount of time. In such off-chain protocols a temporary censorship attack can result into significant financial damage.

AB It is a common narrative that blockchains are immutable and so it is technically impossible to erase data stored on them. For legal and ethical reasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase locally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common assumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase data contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from participating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e., Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks. Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to the best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.

AB While many distributed consensus protocols provide robust liveness and consistency guarantees under the presence of malicious actors, quantitative estimates of how economic incentives affect security are few and far between. In this paper, we describe a system for simulating how adversarial agents, both economically rational and Byzantine, interact with a blockchain protocol. This system provides statistical estimates for the economic difficulty of an attack and how the presence of certain actors influences protocol-level statistics, such as the expected time to regain liveness. This simulation system is influenced by the design of algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning systems that use explicit modeling of an agent's reward mechanism to evaluate and optimize a fully autonomous agent. We implement and apply this simulation framework to Kadena's Chainweb, a parallelized Proof-of-Work system, that contains complexity in how miner incentive compliance affects security and censorship resistance. We provide the first formal description of Chainweb that is in the literature and use this formal description to motivate our simulation design. Our simulation results include a phase transition in block height growth rate as a function of shard connectivity and empirical evidence that censorship in Chainweb is too costly for rational miners to engage in. We conclude with an outlook on how simulation can guide and optimize protocol development in a variety of contexts, including Proof-of-Stake parameter optimization and peer-to-peer networking design.

AB Blockchain technology allows running ordered transactions within an immutable public ledger in a decentralized manner. It consists of two processes: advertisement where the participants become aware of the new transactions and chain extension where the validated transactions are added into a block by extending the chain. Existing blockchain protocols have mainly focused on the chain extension, though the advertisement process has not been dealt with in depth. More specifically, transaction advertisement is fulfilled in an altruistic manner and the same gossip-like propagation mechanism is used for both transactions and blocks. Consequently, the existing protocols are not only incompatible within a rational setting where participants try to maximize their benefit but also suffering from inefficient bandwidth usage.
   In this work, we propose Tulip, a two-layered blockchain framework, which enriches any blockchain protocol with respect to the aforementioned advertisement issues. Tulip treats the advertisement and chain extension processes separately. Transactions are collected and verified by a transaction collector, whereas extending the chain with a new block is done by a round leader. In order to achieve a generic framework, we model the basic functionalities of a ledger. These functionalities are realized by any existing blockchain protocol and responsible for the chain extension process. Thanks to the modular structure of Tulip, the chain extension process can be combined with an incentive compatible and bandwidth-efficient advertisement process. Tulip can be built upon any blockchain protocol while preserving the ledger properties persistence and liveness. Moreover, it enhances the liveness into strong liveness property which requires only one honest participant, rather than all, to advertise a transaction. In this manner, to the best of our knowledge, Tulip forms the first blockchain protocol having incentive compatible chain extension and transaction advertisement processes. Finally, we show that Tulip can be used to reduce redundant bandwidth usage by up to 99%.

AB As of 2014, a fifth of EU citizens relied on cloud accounts to store their documents according to a Eurostat report. Although useful, there are downsides to the use of cloud documents. They often accumulate sensitive information over time, including financial information. This makes them attractive targets to cybercriminals. To understand what happens to compromised cloud documents that contain financial information, we set up 100 fake payroll sheets comprising 1000 fake records of fictional individuals. We populated the sheets with traditional bank payment information, cryptocurrency details, and payment URLs. To lure cybercriminals and other visitors into visiting the sheets, we leaked links pointing to the sheets via paste sites. We collected data from the sheets for a month, during which we observed 235 accesses across 98 sheets. Two sheets were not opened. We also recorded 38 modifications in 7 sheets. We present detailed measurements and analysis of accesses, modifications, edits, and devices that visited payment URLs in the sheets. Contrary to our expectations, bank payment URLs received many more clicks than cryptocurrency payment URLs despite the popularity of cryptocurrencies and emerging blockchain technologies. On the other hand, sheets that contained cryptocurrency details recorded more modifications than sheets that contained traditional banking information. In summary, we present a comprehensive picture of what happens to compromised cloud spreadsheets.

AB Peer-to-peer systems are well-known patterns of distributed systems which created several revelations in designing ultra-scalable systems. Recently, these types of systems are evolved into cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Because of the distributed nature of Internet of Things (IoT), peer-to-peer systems such as blockchain can be used to design management mechanisms in IoT. Therefore, we need an architecture which facilitates the utilization of peer-to-peer systems in IoT based systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general architecture based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an architecture for managing IoT based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. In order to study the potential of the proposed architecture, we suggest an adaptive search mechanism and also a topology management algorithm utilizing the proposed architecture. The results show the efficiency of the suggested algorithms. The proposed architecture may facilitate a new evolution from peer-to-peer systems to thing-to-thing systems.

AB the blockchain is an emerging technology with a core of a distributed ledger of connected blocks consisting of immutable transactions with decentralized management. The importance of blockchain technology and its impact in different domains highlights the need for understanding and evaluation of this technology. Understanding and evaluating technology from different aspects requires identifying the characteristics and specific criteria of that technology. In this regard, in this paper, after discussing the subject literature, the concept of the blockchain platform is described and a number of selected blockchain platforms are examined. Besides, the high-level benchmarking of the platform is evaluated from two aspects of the expected features of the platforms and their architectural components. Finally, due to the importance and significance of the criteria and their frequency, a set of effective criteria is chosen and accordingly, selected platforms of the blockchain are analyzed.

AB Number of devices using Internet is increasing every day and this fact makes the need to improve the Internet of things protocol more than ever. Data protection and privacy is one of the key challenges in the Internet of Things technology. Dangers involved in the centralized technology of Blockchain system have led to the idea of using Tangle, which is a decentralized system. The main purpose of this new technology is to improve the problems and limitations of Blockchain such as high cost and time to confirm a transaction. In this new architecture, every node is involved in maintaining network security. This way, if a transaction is created, then it should select and confirm two unconfirmed transactions issued before. A walking algorithm is needed for this selection. Walking algorithms presented in literature thus far are either weighted or unweighted. An unweighted random walk algorithm can approve transactions nearly proportional to the time of their arrivals while a weighted algorithm can better defend against lazy and malicious transactions. In this paper, a new random walk algorithm is presented that has the benefits of both algorithms at the same time. The idea is to adapt the weight value to the current situation of transactions. Numerical results have shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the existing algorithms in providing a balance between timeliness of approving transactions and protecting against malicious activities.

AB In previous work, we proposed a scalable multi-party verification scheme for expensive iterative computations on a Blockchain substrate by appropriate storage and endorsement of frames of iterates. In this work, we extend the framework to verify sets of complete computations with different unordered hyperparameters and develop frame ordering and compression algorithms to enable scalability in the system. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by verifying the OpenMalaria epidemiological simulation.

AB To ensure that the data aggregation, data storage, and data processing are all performed in a decentralized but trusted manner, we propose to use the blockchain with the mining pool to support IoT services based on cognitive radio networks. As such, the secondary user can send its sensing data, i.e., transactions, to the mining pools. After being verified by miners, the transactions are added to the blocks. However, under the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it is challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction transmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the secondary user. Specifically, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that allows the secondary user to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms the conventional Q-learning scheme in terms of reward and learning speed.

AB Smart grid (SG) provides a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism wherein the electric vehicles (EVs) can trade for energy with their peers using the information and communication technologies. However, the dependence on third party for coordinating the energy trading decisions leads to a bottleneck for any distributed environment. Therefore, blockchain technology can provide a privacy-preserving and effective consensus mechanism without the control of trusted third party. Although blockchain provides inherent secure framework for transactional process, but the this security is because of computational complexity enforced. In SG environment, the conventional blockchain process could not be employed due to limited computational resources with EVs, which makes it difficult to solve the tough computational puzzles to validate the transactions. On the other hand, any compromise on the computation difficulty makes it more vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, in this paper, SmartChain: a blockchain inspired smart and scalable ledger framework which does not require much computational complexity is designed for secure peer-to-peer energy trading in SG ecosystem. The proposed framework is evaluated using the parameters such as execution and validation time. The results obtained depict the superiority of SmartChain in contrast to the conventional blockchain process.

ID DESIGN
AB Caching and sharing contents among mobile devices via wireless device-to-device (D2D) communications is a promising way to offload data traffic. In order to encourage more content sharing among mobile devices, we propose a blockchain incentive scheme in this paper, where the base station (BS) can allocate computing power to mine blockchain in a period of time and give this mining profit to the mobile devices that share contents with others via D2D communication. In order to maximize the total profit, we develop the caching placement schemes considering different relationships between the allocated computing power and the shared data size. For the linear relationship, we can obtain the closed form expression of the optimal caching scheme and find that the mobile device prefers to cache the popular contents. For the nonlinear relationship, the optimal problem can be effectively solved by difference of convex (DC) programming and the results reveal that the mobile device prefers to caching different contents.

AB Recently, there has been increasing interest in employing blockchain in different applications, other than crypto-currencies. Blockchains allow a peer to peer distributed network where different nodes communicate with each other, in a trustless manner. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables long range communication. Although LoRaWAN networks are secure, the LoRaWAN join procedure is susceptible to replay and jamming attacks. Moreover, trust between network server and LoRa end device is the basic foundation of LoRaWAN network however, the centralized nature of network servers raise trust issues between network operators and customers. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight two factor authentication mechanism for LoRaWAN join procedure, based on blockchain technology. The proposed blockchain based framework provides an extra layer of security for LoRaWAN join procedure and build trust among LoRaWAN network components. The proposed framework is validated using the Ethereum blockchain. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides efficient system performance in terms of throughput and latency. The proposed blockchain architecture is a cost effective solution, which can be utilized in the LoRaWAN network with few network servers and LoRa end device, having no strict requirement of throughput and latency.

AB Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a new technology in modern electric power transmission networks. It allows bi-directional flow of communication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart Grid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due to the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of untrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure suffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems, issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG). Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness against different security attacks.

AB Smart Communities seeks to thrive in a context of broadband economy, its engine and reason for being. The success of any community is a function of its economic backbone or the supply chain. A supply chain can be defined as the integration of customers, retailers, distributors and manufacturers. The changing technology has made the survival in commerce highly competitive and price sensitive. Blockchain technology can be the game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure and building a trust layer for business logic. BlockCom is a commerce model based on the emerging technology of blockchain. This paper presents a double auction scheme for energy trading between customers and suppliers. A smart contract implements a distributed algorithm to maximize individual participating profit. Parties bid to smart contract which act as auctioneer for maximizing the profit. Mathematical parameter named credibility score has been created to deal with trust issues in the decentralized network using byzantine fault tolerant mechanism. BlockCom provides a fresh perspective on the concept of supply chain and commerce.

AB With the increasing development of advanced communication technologies, vehicles are becoming smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features with reduced computational and communicational overheads. Further, its extensive evaluation on the widely applicable Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool guarantee its safeness against different attack vectors.

AB The concept of hlockchain radio access network (B-RAN) was proposed to integrate cross-network resources including spectra and infrastructures to meet the explosive growth of diverse connectivity needs. In this work, we consider the prototype design of B-RAN and address the issues arising in its implementation. To reduce the access delay, we develop a fast smart contract deployment (FSCD) for B-RAN. Also, we propose the concept of digitized spectrum assets (DSA) in BRAN for efficient spectrum sharing and management. We further summarize and demonstrate the B-RAN prototype enhanced by the newly introduced FSCD and DSA, along with the overall workflow. We apply comprehensive simulations based on an in-house experimental platform to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed B-RAN prototype.

AB With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, many security challenges could be introduced at low-end routers. Misbehaving routers affect the availability of the networks by dropping packets selectively and rejecting data forwarding services. Although existing Reputation Management (RM) systems are useful in identifying misbehaving routers, the centralized nature of the RM center has the risk of one-point failure. The emerging blockchain techniques, with the inherent decentralized consensus mechanism, provide a promising method to reduce this one-point failure risk. By adopting the distributed consensus mechanism, we propose a blockchain-based reputation management system in IoT networks to overcome the limitation of centralized router RM systems. The proposed solution utilizes the blockchain technique as a decentralized database to store router reports for calculating reputation of each router. With the proposed reputation calculation mechanism, the reliability of each router would be evaluated, and the malicious misbehaving routers with low reputations will be blacklisted and get isolated. More importantly, we develop an optimized group mining process for blockchain technique in order to improve the efficiency of block generation and reduce the resource consumption. The simulation results validate the distributed blockchain-based RM system in terms of attacks detection and system convergence performance, and the comparison result of the proposed group mining process with existing blockchain models illustrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed works.

DE DAG-based cryptocurrency; cryptocurrency analysis; distributed ledger;
   cryptocurrency simulation
AB In this paper, we address the performance analysis of Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based cryptocurrency on the basis of its native structure. Several attempts on existing blockchain-based cryptocurrencies to resolve the limitation of the transaction processing rate has resulted in numerous form of solutions, such as side-chain, off-chain or data sharding. While those efforts are dedicated to overcome the limitation that the one-dimensional data structure has, a two-dimensional form of distributed ledger as known as DAG-based cryptocurrency has been emerged. Comparing with blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, DAG-based cryptocurrencies feature relatively faster issuance and confirmation of the transactions due to the individual processing method of the transactions. However, existing DAG-based cryptocurrencies also suffer from the instability of the performance, since the confirmation or validation delay can be varied by network condition such as transaction incoming rate. We derive the generic performance model of DAG-based cryptocurrency while varying the parameters. From the derived models, we propose some novel strategies to improve the performance of the DAG-based cryptocurrency system which encourages the participants of the cryptocurrency (both traders and nodes) to boost the transaction processing speed while keeping the ledger healthy. We show the effectiveness of our proposal by numerical statistics obtained by simulation, which results in maximum 46 percent of increase in our case.

AB Blockchain miners processing the transactions and generating blocks are rational and incentivized by financial rewards. Prior research in blockchain security studied such financial incentives for the miners and identified attacks based on withholding and delaying block submissions. Among such attacks, the fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack is the state of the art and provides practical incentives to the rational attacker by increasing its reward at the expense of the rest of the miners in the compromised pool. To defend against FAW attack, we propose Silent Timestamping, which has the mining pool manager enforce the ordering of the shares. Implemented at the mining pool manager, Silent Timestamping does not require networking nor any behavior- or implementation-changes in the miners; the lack of the implementation overheads distinguish Silent Timestamping from other schemes which have been proposed but had limited success in practice. We analyze the optimal attacker behavior against Silent Timestamping and the effectiveness of Silent Timestamping against FAW attack. Silent Timestamping effectively nullifies the reward gain of the FAW attack and reduces the optimal FAW attacker strategy to be either the suboptimal block-withholding attack (which never submits the withheld block in the compromised pool and provides limited incentives for a rational attacker) or honest mining.

AB Blockchain technology has been devised from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much more full range of applications beyond serving as the platform for the digital cryptocurrency. Conceptually, a blockchain ( BC) is defined as a decentralized ledger that registers every transactional operation made in encrypted data format. The implementation of such concept bring about augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in the work environment dynamics from the current centralized structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of transactions by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an overview of BC technology and its applications in the AEC industry and its potential integration with the building information ( BIM) process. Furthermore, the study explores how BC technologies can improve the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of distributed ledgers, their current applications and potential future advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. The study presents some examples the prospective application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the code compliance checking process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, possible directions, and future research directions.

AB Information exchange among architects, contractors, and clients is found to be limited and not completely digital, which creates difficulty in tracking and analyzing the generated unstructured data. Design drawings are developed during the design phase, but not transparently shared among contractors, due to the fear of uncertain changes in design without knowing who changed the designed element and what element is been modified, which can lead to disputes. Blockchain technology enables the transaction of digital information, and revolutionizing different industries like banking, crypto exchanges, insurance, etc., due to its decentralized, encrypted, and secured functionality. This paper proposes the potential application of blockchain technology in design development phase of architecture, engineering, and construction ( AEC) processes by developing a blockchain framework. In this research, the design data generated from design development software and its log files are categorized, and flow of data encryption is determined by using blockchain concepts in order to have a secure ledger, which has the potential to provide a validation to an argument of disputes. The expected contribution of this proposed research is to create a framework to track and register the design commands and events in a secured, transparent, and collaborative platform. The anticipated benefits of this research include the record of proof of work and the mitigation of disputes and litigations related to design defects which includes design error and omissions and construction defects which includes either replacement or modifications in design, resulting to change orders and monetary losses.

AB The article considers the prospecting opportunities of using block-chain technology in the system of labor relations from the point of economics. The Transaction Cost Economics has been adopted as a conceptual basis for the argumentation since it deals with the category of "transaction costs" as a mandatory attribute of any economic relations with the exception of ideal socialist relations, where these are minimal. The objective of the article is as follows: based on the use of Transaction Cost Economics assumptions, to show the possibilities and prospects for using the blockchain in the system of labor relations as a transaction chain, which eliminates fraud, theft, breach of the rights, opportunism, i.e. minimizes transaction costs. In addition, the article researches into the need of updating the classical ideas introduced by Oliver E. Williamson on classes of regulatory structures that guarantee execution of labor relations due to the fact that the wide-scope blockchain implementation could prospectively reduce transaction costs so that these can be accompanied by a new form of regulatory structures, which the author proposes to refer to as a "smart contract". The authors describe the justifications and examples of possible directions for the blockchain technology use to formalize specific aspects of labor relations subject to reduction in transaction costs. The article considers the possibilities, prospects, and grounds lacking in the possibilities of using blockchain technology in the labor relations system.

AB Crowdsensed Data Trading (CDT) is a novel data trading paradigm, in which each data consumer can publicize its demand as some crowdsensing tasks, and some mobile users can compete for these tasks, collect the corresponding data, and sell the results to the consumers. Existing CDT systems either depend on a trusted data trading broker or cannot ensure sellers to report costs honestly. To address this problem, we propose a Reverse-Auction-and-blockchain-based crowdsensed Data Trading (RADT) system, mainly containing a smart contract, called RADToken. We adopt a greedy strategy to determine winners, and prove the truthfulness and individual rationality of the whole reverse auction process. Moreover, we exploit the smart contract with a series of devises to enforce mutually untrusted parties to participate in the data trading honestly. Additionally, we also deploy RADToken on an Ethereum test network to demonstrate its significant performances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CDT work that exploits both auction and blockchain to ensure the truthfulness of the whole data trading process.

AB Blockchain technologies and smart contracts were considered for their potential to provide tremendous benefits as decision support tools to the next generation of warfighters. An investigative team focused on novel security-enhanced information gathering and decision support Artificial-Intelligence (AI) based software agents that will serve as decision support co-pilots when commanders are developing real-time multi-domain orders of battle. As a core construct for this architecture, smart contracts allow for the governance of these systems to be time-bound and/or condition-bound. This disruptive technology propels progress made with distributed multi-agent systems with the numerous security benefits of blockchain technologies. Methods for implementing intelligent computing agents that follow and execute the logic embedded in a contract model will provide a transparent record of agents, chain of trust and chain of custody on the blockchain. This paper will explore mechanisms for maintaining a hierarchy of smart contracts allowing reasoning and decision support over different aspects of the overall command structure. Finally, the potential for maintaining multiple levels of classification across communication channels for platforms tasked with collection and reconnaissance missions will explored.

AB A distributed autonomous learning framework was developed by DAX LLC (Distributed Autonomous Everything) with the goal of revolutionizing what is known as the "eLearning Industry". Although some online platforms share DAX's vision for disrupting, democratizing, and improving accessibility to the online educational ecosystem, they do not offer the same level of security, adaptability, and appeal to the emerging computing technologies community as DAX. DAX's learning framework is built upon its own private blockchain with user-guided adaptation through a suite of distributed applications. This sophisticated architecture serves to protect the student's identity, provides verifiability of trust of historical records, and provides transparency of achievement for a given student encryption key. The inherent security of the private blockchain ensures computer hackers (or nefarious students) aren't poisoning or "gaming" the system. The world is rapidly evolving and internet access creates a changing landscape for traditional education systems. DAX recognizes the need for educational systems to evolve beyond being solely centers of knowledge to becoming the enablers of information sharing and immersive learning. The distributed autonomous classroom concept presented herein is a novel eLearning concept designed to continue to evolve to meet the ever-changing demands of the globally connected, technologically savvy, student of tomorrow.

AB This work develops a principled approach for coordinating decentralized systems that can exchange information, issue and service requests, and perform outcome-focused actions together. It harnesses the resiliency and robustness offered by blockchain frameworks to enable sustained activity in the presence a diverse set of failure modes, operating constraints, and changing task requirements. We accomplish this through the Tactical Distributed Ledger, a distributed computer that can accommodate a wide range of sensors, agents, vehicles, and devices to create a decentralized system. We have used this framework to deploy a multi-participant system that combines sensing, vehicle mobility, and situational awareness to perform coordinated activities in a simulated city environment. The key mechanism that enables this interaction is a robust auction framework implemented on top of a smart contract blockchain system. This paper details the design, components, and features of the auction system.

AB The benefits of blockchain technology are evident in the banking industry as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies. Recently, research has been focused on novel, non-cryptocurrency uses of blockchain for other industries such as national defense. Application of these technologies in military use cases requires special consideration of the limitations inherent to tactical military operations, namely the network communication technologies. In this work we explore the performance of blockchain technologies on network environments representative of those available in Department of Defense (DoD) tactical operations. Our experimentation with the Ethereum blockchain on a mobile network emulation reveals a series of verbose blockchain network communication protocols as well as a heavy reliance on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for block transfer and synchronization that may limit the effectiveness of blockchain on current DoD mobile ad hoc networks.

AB We present a toolchain for developing and verifying smart contracts that can be executed on Bitcoin. The toolchain is based on BitML, a recent domain-specific language for smart contracts with a computationally sound embedding into Bitcoin. Our toolchain automatically verifies relevant properties of contracts, among which liquidity, ensuring that funds do not remain frozen within a contract forever. A compiler is provided to translate BitML contracts into sets of standard Bitcoin transactions: executing a contract corresponds to appending these transactions to the blockchain. We assess our toolchain through a benchmark of representative contracts.

DE Smart Contracts; Metrics; Mining Software Repositories
AB Used as a platform for executing smart contracts, Blockchain technology has yielded new programming languages. We propose a graph-based framework for computing software design metrics for the Solidity programming language, and use this framework in a preliminary study on 505 smart contracts mined from GitHub. The results show that most of the smart contracts are rather straightforward from an objected-oriented point of view and that new design metrics specific to smart contracts should be developed.

DE blockchain; music industry; infrastructures; technological promises;

AB The article analyses the emergence of blockchain technology in music industry, unfolding narratives, expectations and promises surrounding blockchain's impact on the circulation of digital recorded music. Blockchain is increasingly addressed as the upcoming "revolution" in music industry and is often acclaimed as a new "disruptive technology", able to change the game in the music business. The article analyses how this innovation is discursively constructed by news articles, start-ups self-presentations and other documents. From a theoretical point of view, the analysis relies on concepts coming from Science & Technology Studies (STS) and especially information infrastructure studies and the study of technological promises, thus enriching the intersection between sound studies and STS. On these bases, the article outlines an overview of the 'hype' discourse generated around music blockchain, recognizing five main technological promises supporting the adoption of blockchain. Moreover, it also brings to the foreground some concerns about the possible consequences of this adoption for the evolution of music value and music circulation processes.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB We introduce Graphene, a method and protocol for interactive set reconciliation among peers in blockchains and related distributed systems. Through the novel combination of a Bloom filter and an Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT), Graphene uses a fraction of the network bandwidth used by deployed work for one-and two-way synchronization. We show that, for this specific problem, Graphene is more efficient at reconciling n items than using a Bloom filter at the information theoretic bound. We contribute a fast and implementation-independent algorithm for parameterizing an IBLT so that it is optimally small in size and meets a desired decode rate with arbitrarily high probability. We characterize our performance improvements through analysis, detailed simulation, and deployment results for Bitcoin Cash, a prominent cryptocurrency. Our implementations of Graphene, IBLTs, and our IBLT optimization algorithm are all open-source code.

AB Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency built on the blockchain data structure, has generated significant academic and commercial interest. Contrary to prior expectations, recent research has shown that participants of the protocol (the so-called "miners") are not always incentivized to follow the protocol. We study the game induced by one such attack -the pool block withholding attack - in which mining pools (groups of miners) attack other mining pools. We focus on the case of two pools attacking each other, with potentially other mining power in the system.
   We show that this game always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, and its pure price of anarchy, which intuitively measures how much computational power can be wasted due to attacks in an equilibrium, is at most 3. We conjecture, and prove in special cases, that it is in fact at most 2. Our simulations provide compelling evidence for this conjecture, and show that players can quickly converge to the equilibrium by following best response strategies.

TI A Secure Cloud Storage Framework With Access Control Based on Blockchain

AB Now more and more data are being outsourced to cloud services. In order to ensure data security and privacy, data are usually stored on the cloud server in the form of ciphertext. When a user requests access to the encrypted data, an access key distributed by a third party is needed. However, if the third party is dishonest, the security of the system will be threatened. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new secure cloud storage framework with access control by using the Ethereum blockchain technology. Our new scheme is a combination of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). The proposed cloud storage framework is decentralized, that is, there is no trusted third party in the system. Our scheme has three main features. First, as the Ethereum blockchain technology is used, the data owner can store ciphertext of data through smart contracts in a blockchain network. Second, the data owner can set valid access periods for data usage so that the ciphertext can only be decrypted during valid access periods. Finally, as the creation and invocation of each smart contract can be stored in the blockchain, thus, the function of the trace is achieved. The analysis of the security and experiment shows that our scheme is feasible.

DE Decentralized identity asset exchange; Privacy preserving;
   Unlinkability; Counterfeit elimination; Blockchain; ZK-SNARK
AB User's digital identity information has privacy and security requirements. Privacy requirements include confidentiality of the identity information itself, anonymity of those who verify and consume a user's identity information and unlinkability of online transactions which involve a user's identity. Security requirements include correctness, ownership assurance and prevention of counterfeits of a user's identity information. Such privacy and security requirements, although conflicting, are critical for identity management systems enabling the exchange of users' identity information between different parties during the execution of online transactions. Addressing all such requirements, without a centralized party managing the identity exchange transactions, raises several challenges. This paper presents a decentralized protocol for privacy preserving exchange of users' identity information addressing such challenges. The proposed protocol leverages advances in blockchain and zero knowledge proof technologies, as the main building blocks. We provide prototype implementations of the main building blocks of the protocol and assess its performance and security.

AB We study the strategic implications that arise from adding one extra option to the miners participating in the bitcoin protocol. We propose that when adding a block, miners also have the ability to pay forward an amount to be collected by the first miner who successfully extends their branch, giving them the power to influence the incentives for mining. We formulate a stochastic game for the study of such incentives and show that with this added option, smaller miners can guarantee that the best response of even substantially more powerful miners is to follow the expected behavior intended by the protocol designer.

AB We study the computation contests where players compete for searching a solution to a given problem with a winner-take-all reward. The search processes are independent across the players and the search speeds of players are proportional to their computational powers. One concrete application of this abstract model is the mining process of proof-of-work type blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin. Although one's winning probability is believed to be proportional to his computational power in previous studies on Bitcoin, we show that it is not the case in the strict sense.
   Because of the gaps between the winning probabilities and the proportions of computational powers, the Matthew effect will emerge in the system, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In addition, we show that allowing the players to pool with each other or reducing the number of solutions to the problem may aggravate the Matthew effect and vice versa.

AB The Bitcoin payment system involves two agent types: Users that transact with the currency and pay fees and miners in charge of authorizing transactions and securing the system in return for these fees. Two of Bitcoin's challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin's pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the "monopolistic auction" [8], showing: (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one's true maximal willingness to pay) diminishes as the number of bids increases.

TI Decentralized Distribution of PCP Mappings Over Blockchain for
   End-to-End Secure Direct Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS

   communications; trust model
AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method that enables devices with private IP addresses to connect to the Internet by sharing a public IP address. Traversing the NAT device remains a challenge for a wide range of applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT). The Port Control Protocol (PCP) is a relatively new protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to solve the NAT traversal issues. It allows a NATed device to request and manage a mapping between its private IP address and transport-layer port to a public IP address and port. As PCP requires an application-dependent method for distributing the mappings to remote hosts, several attacks can target the distributing server and render the communication channel vulnerable. In this paper, we propose and implement a decentralized Blockchain-based approach for distributing PCP-mappings, enabling secure endto-end (e2e) direct communications without any trusted third party server. NATed devices register their PCP mappings and public keys into the Blockchain, and other peers can then learn about these mappings to establish end-to-end secure direct communications. The implementation verifies that the system is feasible in terms of transactions fees, can simplify and secure end-to-end direct communications, and can interwork with conventional security methods.

   Scheme

DE Multi-party computation; blockchain; smart contract; fairness;
   robustness; secret sharing; game theory
AB In a general secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol, two or more participants who do not trust each other, use their respective secret inputs to calculate a joint function in a distributed environment without a centralized organization. They can get correct outputs on the premise of ensuring privacy and independence of input. In this paper, to solve the problem of fairness and robustness in MPC, a blockchain-based multi-party computation scheme (BFR-MPC) was proposed. The blockchain maintains an open reputation system for parties as a public ledger where a more reputable party has a greater chance to be selected. The block height is used as a trusted timestamp. In each round, parties must send the correct information before the deadline. In our scheme, all parties are considered to be foresighted, and an incentive mechanism encourages parties to cooperate rather than deviate from the protocol. Because of non-cooperative parties will be immediately expelled from the protocol and will be penalized financially, the proposed scheme is robust. The penalty will be used to reward honest parties. We also proved the fairness of our scheme through Game Theory. The comparison results of the proposed scheme with other schemes show that it is a more practical scheme for MPC with high fairness and robustness.

AB Big data, a recently popular term that refers to a massive collection of very large and complex data sets, is facing serious security and privacy challenges. Due to the typical characteristics of big data, namely velocity, volume and variety associated with large-scale cloud infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT), traditional security and privacy mechanisms are inadequate and unable to cope with the rapid data explosion in such a complex distributed computing environment. With big data analytics being widely used by businesses and government for decision making, security risk mitigation plays an important role in big data infrastructures worldwide. Traditional security mechanisms have failed to cope with the scalability, interoperability and adaptability of contemporary technologies that are required for big data. This paper takes an exploratory initial step using first principles to address this gap in literature. Firstly, we establish the current trends in big data comprehensively by identifying eleven Vs as important dimensions of big data, which form the contributing factors having an impact on the impending security problem. Next, we map the eleven Vs to the three phases of big data life cycle in order to unearth the major security and privacy challenges of big data. Finally, the paper provides four practical strategies adapted from contemporary technologies such as data provenance, encryption and access control, data mining and blockchain, identifying their associated real implementation examples. This work would pave way for future research investigations in this important big data security arena.

AB Distributed identity-, attribute- and reputation- management constitutes a major benefit that a properly designed permissioned blockchain system can provide. As a complementary built-in feature set, finely-granulated and time-window-constrained auditability mechanisms aid blockchain performance and scalability by eliminating the need to front-load core transaction processing with onerous communications and computational complexity, while still meeting the requirements of effective governance, risk & compliance management and containment against compromised entities. A prevalent aspect of this methodology is the capability to determine not only what entities should be considered trustworthy, but to what extent and with which relevant functionalities, where completion of tasks entails distributing communications across multiple components as means of addressing corroboration of claimed suitability in order to choose the most trustworthy available solution components matched against specific sub-task requirements.

DE Blockchains; Information Centric Networks; Cache Attacks
AB Protecting and securing data that reside at various hosts in the Internet has become more important than ever before because of the growing number of cyber attacks. Though there have been several studies related to denial of service and cache attacks, those studies are primarily based on simulations and investigations of attacks on real networks are still lacking. In this paper, we experimentally investigated the effects of cache attacks on blockchain based information-centric networks. We used the hyperledger fabric to implement the blockchains for small and medium-sized networks. We implemented cache attacks where the attacker target the cache with unpopular content, forcing the user to fetch the data from the web servers. We experimented with two different topologies ( linear and mesh) and also considered two cache sizes at the nodes. Three cache replacement policies were used: Least Recently Used, Random, and First In First Out. The cache hit, time taken to get the data, and the number of hops to serve the request were obtained with real network traffic. On the hyperledger fabric framework, we implemented two types of requests and showed how the query delay, invoke delay, and update delay vary with time. Based on our results, we find that most of the information centric networks, including the ones based on blockchains, are vulnerable to cache attacks.

DE Delay tolerant network; Post disaster communication; Incentive
   mechanism; Blockchain network; Bitcoin system; Reward model
AB Delay tolerant network (DTN) is successfully proposed for setting up emergency post disaster communication networks when normal communication infrastructure is incapacitated. Performance of such networks get affected by selfish nodes that do not participate in message forwarding. Thus, nodes must receive satisfactory rewards for cooperation. The available incentive schemes either rely on central trusted authorities or do not use an explicit and secure digital currency. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger of immutable transactions, is an attractive approach for addressing the incentive challenges in peer-to-peer networks that lack central trusted authorities. Bitcoin, the Blockchain based cryptocurrency, make it possible to devise practical credit based incentive schemes for such networks. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain based incentive scheme for DTN based post disaster communication network that uses Bitcoin to incentivize nodes for cooperation. The scheme uses a novel reward strategy to bring rationality in the incentivizing process.

TI Dextt: Deterministic Cross-Blockchain Token Transfers

AB Current blockchain technologies provide very limited interoperability. Restrictions with regard to asset transfers and data exchange between different blockchains reduce the usability and comfort of users, and hinder novel developments within the blockchain space. As a first step towards blockchain interoperability, we propose the DeXTT cross-blockchain transfer protocol, which can be used to record a token transfer on any number of blockchains simultaneously in a decentralized manner. We provide a reference implementation using Solidity, and evaluate its performance. We show logarithmic scalability of DeXTT with respect to the number of participating nodes, and analyze cost requirements of the transferred tokens.

AB From an individual's perspective, technological advancement has merits and demerits. Video captured by surveillance cameras while a person goes about their daily life may improve their personal safety but the images collected may also represent an invasion of their privacy. Because of the ease of digital information sharing, there exists a need to protect that visual information from illegal utilization by untrusted parties. The European parliament has ratified the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been effective since May 2018 with a view to ensuring the privacy of European Union (EU) citizens' and visitors' personal data. The regulation has introduced data safeguards through Pseudonymisation, Encryption, and Data protection-by-design. However, the regulation does not assist with technical and implementation procedures, such as video redaction, to establish those safeguards. This paper refers to the GDPR term "personal data" as "visual personal data" and aims to discuss regulatory safeguards of visual privacy, such as reversible protection, from the technological point-of-view. In the context of GDPR, the roles of machine learning (i.e. within computer vision), image processing, cryptography, and blockchain are explored as a way of deploying Data Protection-by-Design solutions for visual surveillance data. The paper surveys the existing market-based data protection solutions and provides suggestions for the development of GDPR-compliant Data Protection-by-Design video surveillance systems. The paper is also relevant for those entities interacting with EU citizens from outside the EU and for those regions not currently covered by such regulation that may soon implement similar provisions.

TI Smart Contract-Based Product Traceability System in the Supply Chain

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible.

TI EIDM: A Ethereum-Based Cloud User Identity Management Protocol
SO IEEE ACCESS

AB In cloud system, user identity authentication is a key problem. If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility.

TI An Anti-Quantum E-Voting Protocol in Blockchain With Audit Function
SO IEEE ACCESS

DT Article
DE Anti-quantum; audit; blockchain; certificateless; e-voting
AB As an important method of making democratic decisions, voting has always been a topic of social concern. Compared with the traditional, e-voting is widely used in various decision scenarios because of the convenience, easy to participate and low cost. However, the proposed e-voting protocols are at the risk of excessive authority and tampered information, which makes it impossible to achieve true fairness and transparency in e-voting. By combining the blockchain technology, it enables to solve these problems with the decentralization and tamper-resistant features. Moreover, the misoperations of the voters will also affect this fairness, such as voting for non-candidates, abstention or repeated voting. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency of the voting process and maintain the fairness of the voting environment, it is important to append the function of audit in e-voting protocol. This paper proposes an e-voting protocol based on blockchain, which provides transparency in the process of voting. At the same time, this scheme has the ability to audit voters operating incorrectly and resist quantum attacks by adopting the certificateless and code-based cryptography. After performance analysis, our scheme is suitable for the small-scale election and has some advantages in security and efficiency when the number of voters is small.

AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of a number of digital cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a chain of blocks that store information with digital signatures in a decentralized and distributed network. The features of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, transparency and auditability, make transactions more secure and tamper proof. Apart from cryptocurrency, blockchain technology can be used in financial and social services, risk management, healthcare facilities, and so on. A number of research studies focus on the opportunity that blockchain provides in various application domains. This paper presents a comparative study of the tradeoffs of blockchain and also explains the taxonomy and architecture of blockchain, provides a comparison among different consensus mechanisms and discusses challenges, including scalability, privacy, interoperability, energy consumption and regulatory issues. In addition, this paper also notes the future scope of blockchain technology.

TI A Traceable Blockchain-Based Access Authentication System With Privacy

   VANETs
AB The vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) is one of the most promising application in the communications of smart vehicles and the smart transportation systems. However, authentication and privacy of users are still two vital issues in VANETs. It is crucial to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting the forged messages while preserving the privacy of vehicles against the tracking attack. Moreover, in the traditional mode, the transactional data storage provides no distributed and decentralized security, so that the third party initiates the dishonest behaviors possibly. In this paper, based on blockchain technique, we propose a traceable and decentralized the Internet of Vehicle system framework for communication among smart vehicles by employing of a secure access authentication scheme between vehicles and RoadSide Units (RSUs). On the one hand, this scheme allows that vehicles employ pseudonyms for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications anonymously in the non-fully trusted environment. On the other hand, the transparency of vehicles in authentication and announcement is preformed efficiently by the blockchain technology. In addition, the transaction information is tamper-resistant that provides the distributed and decentralized property for the different cloud servers. With the help of Certificate Authority (CA) and the RoadSide Units (RSUs), our proposal achieves the conditional privacy to trace the real identity of the malicious vehicle in the anonymous announcements as well. Finally, through the theoretical analysis and simulations, our scheme is able to construct a secure and decentralized system framework of VANETs with accountability and privacy preservation.

TI Delegated Proof of Stake With Downgrade: A Secure and Efficient
   Blockchain Consensus Algorithm With Downgrade Mechanism
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; consensus algorithm; delegated proof of stake with
   downgrade; downgrade mechanism; efficiency; fairness; decentralization
AB Blockchain technology has a wide range of applications in the fields of finance, credit reporting and intellectual property, etc. As the core of blockchain, consensus algorithm affects the security and performance of blockchain system directly. In the past 10 years, there have been about 30 consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) and AlgoRand. But their security, stability and operating efficiency still lag far behind our actual needs. This paper introduces the computing power competition of PoW into DPoS to design an improved consensus algorithm named Delegated Proof of Stake with Downgrade (DDPoS). Through the further modification, the impact of both computing resources and stakes on generating blocks is reduced to achieve higher efficiency, fairness, and decentralization in consensus process. Then a downgrade mechanism is proposed to quickly replace the malicious nodes to improve the security. The simulation experiments in blockchain system show that the proposed consensus algorithm is significantly more efficient than PoW and PoS, but slightly lower than DPoS. However, its degree of centralization remains far below that of DPoS. And through the downgrade mechanism, the proposed consensus algorithm can detect and downgrade the malicious nodes timely to ensure the security and good operation of system.

AB We consider estimating the source of a spreading process on a directed acyclic graph using noisy and incomplete observations; we believe this is the first work on source estimation under noisy information. Our main contribution is a novel heuristic, the generalized Jordan center (GJC), which is the maximum likelihood estimator of the diffusion source under mild conditions.

AB In this paper we revisit the mining strategies in Proof of Work based cryptocurrencies and propose two strategies, which we call smart and smarter mining, that in many cases strictly dominate honest mining. In contrast to other known attacks, such as selfish mining, which induce zero-sum games among the miners, the strategies proposed in this paper increase miners' profit by reducing their variable costs (i.e., electricity). Moreover, the proposed strategies are viable for much smaller miners than previously known attacks and, surprisingly, an attack launched by one miner can be profitable for all other miners as well.
   While saving electricity is very encouraging for the environment, it may affect the coin's security. The smart and smarter mining strategies expose the coin to under 50% attacks, and this vulnerability might only grow when new miners join the coin in response to the increased profit margins induced by these strategies.

AB Smart contracts are self-executing agreements written in program code and are envisioned to be one of the main applications of blockchain technology. While they are supported by prominent cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, their further adoption is hindered by fundamental scalability challenges. For instance, in Ethereum contract execution suffers from a latency of more than 15 s, and the total number of contracts that can be executed per second is very limited. State channel networks are one of the core primitives aiming to address these challenges. They form a second layer over the slow and expensive blockchain, thereby enabling instantaneous contract processing at negligible costs.
   In this work we present the first complete description of a state channel network that exhibits the following key features. First, it supports virtual multi-party state channels, i.e. state channels that can be created and closed without blockchain interaction and that allow contracts with any number of parties. Second, the worst case time complexity of our protocol is constant for arbitrary complex channels. This is in contrast to the existing virtual state channel construction that has worst case time complexity linear in the number of involved parties. In addition to our new construction, we provide a comprehensive model for the modular design and security analysis of our construction.

AB Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) comprise of a network of physically distributed embedded sensors and actuators equipped with computational and communication capability. In CPS, Internet of Things (IoT) devices communicate in a trustless environment as the data can be compromised due to the centralized database, limited power and computational constraints. At the same time, reliability and resiliency are key concerns in CPS in the face of unforeseen circumstances, often emanating from disaster based failures. In this paper, critical issues of centralized database security in CPS are addressed via a distributed blockchain based solution. The proposed system encompasses a smart contract based framework in Ethereum blockchain. It further explores the potential of blockchain in securing and offering a distributed network for the CPS in a closed loop manner. To demonstrate the realizability of the proposed framework, a testbed implementation for the proposed idea is provided. A desktop computer, a laptop, a simple temperature sensor and a Light Emitting Diode (LED) are interfaced in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using Ethereum. The speedy transaction of sensor data in the blockchain at various difficulty levels and actuation through smart contracts enhance the usability of the platform for CPS and various IoT applications.

AB The emergence of new connectivity services for automated transportation marks a paradigm shift for the operation of wireless networks. Furthermore, the advent of blockchain technology promises to enable a plethora of smart mobility services, which are not contingent on any central authorities. Concepts such as distributed ledger require efficient and reliable data dissemination between vehicles. Traditional techniques based on Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) are well known to scale poorly in all-cast networks due to the feedback implosion problem. Fountain and network coding techniques are arguably the most promising alternative solutions. In this paper we derive new analytical bounds on transmit message lengths and quantify bandwidth delay trade-offs for fountain coding based data dissemination for CAVs.

AB The development of Internet of Things (IoT) has paved way for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are indispensable for ITS with intelligent vehicles (IV) as their key players. To ensure proper and reliable VANET operation, IVs need secure inter-and intra-network communication with trust and reliability of data (provenance). This paper aims to provide trust management in VANETs by proposing a trustless system model using blockchain and a certificate authority (CA) for registering IVs as well as revoking their registration if need be. Furthermore, to preserve data reliability, this paper uses physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Implementation of DrivMan shows that it is able to establish distributed trust management and enables secure data sharing while preserving the privacy of IVs.

AB The massive adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires the grid system to coordinate with a large number of energy transactions, where the current grid network poses vulnerability against the excessive power loads and attacks. The difficulty of an efficient charging/discharging control mechanism lies on the randomness of future events and scalability of the transaction platform. In this paper, a Proof-of-Benefit consensus mechanism with Online benefit generating (ONPoB) algorithm is proposed on the blockchain platform to handle the EV charging/discharging loads to flatten the overall power load fluctuation. It is demonstrated that all EVs can be charged and achieves a best-known competitive ratio of 2.39. The ONPoB consensus mechanism is approved to better accommodate the EV scenario compared with other mechanisms. And the ONPoB algorithm is able to substantially reduce the Power Fluctuation Level (PFL) in comparison with popular scheduling algorithms.

DE Energy trading; blockchain; smart contract; electric vehicles
AB With the development of the autonomous hybrid plug-in electric vehicles (AHEVs), majority of AHEVs are equipped with bidirectional chargers. However, during the energy trading process, the centralized schemes are exposed to many flaws like the high energy transmission loss and cannot resist the single-point failure. Therefore, it is more important to use the decentralized manner to keep the safety energy trading between AHEVs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized energy trading architecture in which AHEVs can broadcast their requirements to neighbors and negotiate with other AHEVs on the transmission parameters without a transaction server. The smart contract (SC) is deployed among RSUs which can be automatically executed after the negotiation process. To promote AHEVs to behave honestly on the road, we associate the trust value of AHEVs with the charging price. We use proof-of-concept to theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of the development of the SC and the security properties of the proposed scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed negotiation scheme outperforms the non-negotiation scheme in the aspect of efficiency.

AB Permissionless blockchain-enabled smart contracts execute code in a distributed peer-to-peer network system and thereby overcome undesirable effects of system centralization. Smart contracts that use proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms for the validation of transactions have advantages over proof-of work (PoW) in that they use less electricity and perform faster. The disadvantage of PoS algorithms is the issue of nothing to stake and the emergence of staking oligopolies. Thus, significant stakeholders might be able to create an oligopoly as miners with significant stakes have the chance to validate the transaction in a dominant position. In current smart contracts, the adoption of mobile devices is another emerging trend to manage mobile smart contracts. The advantage is spreading of a democratization effect as a large number of stakers participate in transaction validation and thereby reduce the risk of oligopolies. In our work, we aim to improve the PoS algorithm to reduce oligopoly formation in smart contracts by addressing the need for creating mobile smart contracts that are governed by a mobile lifecycle management. Additionally, we enhance the scalability and performance of smart contracts by focusing specifically on ways to incentivize PoS algorithms.

   2-PARTY COMPUTATION; LOWER BOUNDS; LIMITATIONS
AB We study the foundations of secure computation in the blockchain-hybrid model, where a blockchain - modeled as a global functionality is available as an Oracle to all the participants of a cryptographic protocol. We demonstrate both destructive and constructive applications of blockchains:
   We show that classical rewinding-based simulation techniques used in many security proofs fail against blockchain-active adversaries that have read and post access to a global blockchain. In particular, we show that zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with black-box simulation are impossible against blockchain-active adversaries.
   Nevertheless, we show that achieving security against blockchain-active adversaries is possible if the honest parties are also blockchain active. We construct an omega(1)-round ZK protocol with black-box simulation. We show that this result is tight by proving the impossibility of constant-round ZK with black-box simulation.
   Finally, we demonstrate a novel application of blockchains to overcome the known impossibility results for concurrent secure computation in the plain model. We construct a concurrent self-composable secure computation protocol for general functionalities in the blockchain-hybrid model based on standard cryptographic assumptions.
   We develop a suite of techniques for constructing secure protocols in the blockchain-hybrid model that we hope will find applications to future research in this area.

AB Public key quantum money can be seen as a version of the quantum no-cloning theorem that holds even when the quantum states can be verified by the adversary. In this work, we investigate quantum lightning where no-cloning holds even when the adversary herself generates the quantum state to be cloned. We then study quantum money and quantum lightning, showing the following results:
   We demonstrate the usefulness of quantum lightning beyond quantum money by showing several potential applications, such as generating random strings with a proof of entropy, to completely decentralized cryptocurrency without a block-chain, where transactions is instant and local.
   We give Either/Or results for quantum money/lightning, showing that either signatures/hash functions/commitment schemes meet very strong recently proposed notions of security, or they yield quantum money or lightning. Given the difficulty in constructing public key quantum money, this suggests that natural schemes do attain strong security guarantees.
   We show that instantiating the quantum money scheme of Aaronson and Christiano [STOC'12] with indistinguishability obfuscation that is secure against quantum computers yields a secure quantum money scheme. This construction can be seen as an instance of our Either/Or result for signatures, giving the first separation between two security notions for signatures from the literature.
   Finally, we give a plausible construction for quantum lightning, which we prove secure under an assumption related to the multi-collision resistance of degree-2 hash functions. Our construction is inspired by our Either/Or result for hash functions, and yields the first plausible standard model instantiation of a non-collapsing collision resistant hash function. This improves on a result of Unruh [Eurocrypt'16] which is relative to a quantum oracle.

AB Lithopia is a prototype of a blockchain-managed fictional village that uses satellite and drone data to trigger smart contracts on the open source blockchain platform, Hyperledger. The project is testing the possibility of anticipatory governance of emerging blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by involving stakeholders in the design process over templates. The goal is to question the promises of blockchain governance happening over automation and smart contracts and to offer an alternative to the misuses of emerging technologies in the so-called predictive and anticipatory design.
   The prototype consists of a functional Node-RED dashboard used as an interface for the Hyperledger smart contracts and a design fiction movie about the lives of the Lithopians.

TI Storage Mechanism Optimization in Blockchain System Based on Residual

AB Huge storage volume is one of the main bottlenecks for the development of blockchain, so how to release the burden by optimizing the storage mechanism has become an important problem. Most of the current solutions would modify the architecture of blockchain, which weakens the characteristics of the decentralization, such as cloud storage. In this paper, a storage optimization mechanism based on residual number system is proposed to reduce the storage volume on each node. In addition, the recovery procedure of CRT-II (The new Chinese Remainder Theorem) is used to detect garbled data from devil nodes, which enable the proposed storage mechanism with strong fault tolerance capability. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results prove the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme.

AB In recent years, the rapid urbanization of world's population causes many economic, social, and environmental problems, which affect people's living conditions and quality of life significantly. The concept of "smart city" brings opportunities to solve these urban problems. The objectives of smart cities are to make the best use of public resources, provide high-quality services to the citizens, and improve the people's quality of life. Information and communication technology plays an important role in the implementation of smart cities. Blockchain as an emerging technology has many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy, automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving blockchain technology applied to smart cities. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we review how blockchain technology is applied in the realm of smart cities, from the perspectives of smart citizen, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, supply chain management, and others. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.

AB Decentralization is a term widely used in a variety of contexts, particularly in political science and discourses surrounding the Internet. It is popular today among advocates of blockchain technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is theorized or consistently defined. This nonspecificity has served to draw diverse participants into common political and technological projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate mechanisms of accountability.

TI Passing cash from bank notes to bitcoin: standardizing money
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE Standardization; money; bitcoin; bank note; technology
AB This essay is about the modern bank note and bitcoin and how each standardizes money. Whether constituted by paper or protocol, whether performing (or failing) as a store of wealth, a medium of exchange, or unit of account, bank notes and bitcoins enact interchangeable equivalence with themselves, every one-pound note or bitcoin the same as another, and their mode of passing hand-to-hand or peer-to-peer also conscripts their holders as readily interchangeable. This essay examines the different ways that these two types of currency engineered this standardization, and I show how the new blockchain technology of Bitcoin innovated upon the standardizing process that made bank notes interchangeable. As I recount in the essay's first half, standardizing physical bank notes involved re-imagining them detached from the temporality of any specific contractual transaction so as to be, like coin, grasped as immediately physically interchangeable, and the bank note used print and the act of reading to do so. In the essay's second half, I discuss how, by contrast, Bitcoin standardizes money not by operating on any physical object, not even a digital one, but by creating a sense of immediately fungible value through maintaining the unique historicity of every transaction in the system.

AB The existing approach to threat detection of dust transactions in a blockchain is conducted by setting a fixed amount of transactions. This is difficult to achieve due to the dynamic and variable nature of practical applications, so the performance is poor. This paper proposes a blockchain dust transaction threat detection model (BDTTDM) that uses the historical transactions generated in the blockchain as a vaccine for dust transaction detection. An artificial immune algorithm is used to detect dust transactions. The experimental results show that the dust transaction recognition rate by BDTTDM is 98.9%, which is 229.3% higher than that of the classic blockchain dust transaction model - Bitcoin Core client.

TI BLOCKCHAIN IN DIGITAL CRIMINOLOGY: PROBLEM STATEMENT

DT Article

   cyberterrorism; cybersecurity; distributed registry/blockchain
   technology; information; new technologies
AB The problem under consideration is highly topical as damage from cybercrime is predicted to reach six trillion dollar in 2021, compared with 3 trillion in 2015. The authors put forth a hypothesis that blockchain could become the technology that will reduce the scale of damage from criminal infringements in the sphere of digital economy by simplifying control over illegal movement of capital. The goal of this research is to analyze the role that the technology of distributed registers/blockchain plays in digital criminology and counteracting cybercrime. In blockchain, there is no single point of attack on the database, and it is impossible to access data encrypted with a key without that key. There is not centralized storage for keys: each user-owner stores them. The authors study the technology of storing data in blockchain or distributed register (blockchain being a special case of distributed register). If such a server center is attacked, it is impossible to steal all data that are stored on it at once. This will deliver a serious blow on the criminal transactions because the whole history of operations is saved, the financial flows are transparent in the chain of blocks and it will be virtually impossible to hide them, which will eliminate all illegal transactions and make the financing of terrorist and extremist organizations much more difficult. Because all users-owners have the database, the theft will be noticed immediately, and it cannot be hidden. It will get known whose secret key is used for access, and it will point directly at the perpetrator and could, in itself, stop them. The authors describe how distributed registers can be used to fight cybercrime. They believe that 1) the problem of cybercrime is most relevant for developed countries (with high GDP) because the more developed a society is, the more it depends on digital technologies; 2) the distributed registers/blockchain technology will help counteract cyberattacks and, consequently, will protect finances and confidential information against criminal infringements.

AB A smart infrastructure with many sensors becomes a complex hybrid system. Excluding external adversaries from infiltrating into the infrastructure is a key problem. With a formalized adversary model, we propose a decentralized architecture for smart infrastructure security. First, it effectively embeds information from the physical features of infrastructures into security. Second, our mechanism is managed through a decentralized blockchain architecture. Third, our approach is especially scalable to ever growing smart infrastructures. We prototyped an authentication blockchain for smart grids with a high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Our implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of our mechanism compared to existing approaches.

AB Blockchain is treated as a ledger system that manages data and their transactions using time-stamped blocks through cryptography and works in a decentralised manner over the computing network. Although blockchain is originally used as a backbone for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, its capabilities and applications have yet to be extended far beyond cryptocurrencies. In this paper, through conducting a latest systematic literature review aiming to produce new source of evidence, we identify potential applications of the blockchain technologies in healthcare. The comprehensive review looks at the professional and academic open-sourced journals published between 2008 to 2019 to recognise the potential of blockchain based approaches in the purpose of healthcare information disseminations, as well as to segregate issues for the implementation and development of blockchain applications. We identify several major application domains that present research opportunities and challenges for the future advancements and directions for the benefits of IS researchers and professionals.

AB The management of heterogeneous distributed sensor networks requires new solutions to address the problem of data quality and false data detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper, we present a nonlinear cooperative control algorithm based on game theory and blockchain. Here, a new model is proposed for the automatic processing and management of data in heterogeneous distributed wireless sensor networks stored in a blockchain. We apply our algorithm for improving temperature data quality in indoor surfaces.

AB There are many power system grid carrying energy from power plants to consumer. In order to manage these huge grid are all monitored by WSN and controlled by a large cluster of computers. However, the problem is how to ensure that all the data transmitted by the grid is authentic and has not been modified in any way. This paper presents a model for increasing communication security in the power system grid. For this purpose, blockchain is used to store all communication data, blockchain is distributed, secure and reliable. The main goal is that information is protected in the blockchain against modification attempts. In addition, power source can be authenticated and tracked from the consumer to the source.

AB Nowadays, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) sensors lose accuracy in their measurements. This address two problems that have a direct influence on monitoring and control that WSN performs. The first one is data collected by the WSN from inaccurate sensors. And secondly, high maintenance cost of WSN if it is not known exactly which sensors are inaccurate. In this paper we propose a stochastic model using Blockchain to predict the degradation of sensor accuracy, knowing its current state. The expected results are the prediction with a high degree of accuracy that sensors will be inaccurate in the near future in order to perform proper maintenance and maintain data quality.

AB Lost luggage is one of the main fears when boarding a plane, especially on long flights. Around 10,000 suitcases are lost every day at airports around the world. The proposed solution is to locate much faster and more efficiently the lost object. There are currently a multitude of players involved in this process, who could synchronize by sharing information, which would save airlines costs. This way, the customer and the airline can know where the luggage is at any time.

AB Blockchain applications have shown huge potential in various domains. Proof of Work (PoW) is the key procedure in blockchain applications, which exhibits the memory-bound characteristic and hinders the performance improvement of blockchain accelerators. In order to mitigate the "memory wall" and improve the performance of memory-hard PoW accelerators, using Ethash as an example, we optimize the memory architecture from two perspectives: 1) Hiding memory latency. We propose specialized context switch design to overcome the uncertain cycles of repetitive memory requests. 2) Increasing memory bandwidth utilization. We introduce on-chip memory that stores a portion of the Ethash directed acyclic graph (DAG) for larger effective memory bandwidth, and further propose adopting embedded NOR flash to fulfill the role. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of our optimized memory architecture for Ethash, including number of hash cores, on-chip/off-chip memory technologies and specifications. Based on the design space exploration, we finally provide the guidance for designing the memory-bound PoW accelerator. The experiment results show that our optimized designs achieve 8.7% - 55% higher hash rate and 17% - 120% higher hash rate per Joule compared with the baseline design in different configurations.

AB With the rapid development of medical information services, the construction of intelligent hospitals is opening up a new mode of medical treatment in the health care industry. Medical data is gradually becoming more and more important, while it also faces some challenges, among which the most urgent problem to be solved is data security and privacy protection. In the construction of intelligent hospitals, the safety issues among the basic information of patients, the protection of medical information and inter-institutional information sharing have become the focus at this stage. Blockchain technology, with highly security, reliable architecture and algorithm design have operated stably in the financial industry for more than seven years. The related innovative technologies such as distributed ledgers, smart contracts, symmetric encryptions and consensus mechanisms are used widely in many fields. This paper will take the demonstration construction of Chongqing Intelligent Hospital as an example, which tries to combine the blockchain, homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology to carry out the research on the security construction and data privacy protection of intelligent hospitals.

AB The blockchain technology is complex and involves a wide range of fields, which leads to the lack of uniform specifications for the development of blockchain applications. Although blockchain used to be divided according to the decentralized degree by some organizations, which are difficult to give developers specific guidance and results. To this end, this paper proposed a feature-oriented classification method of blockchain applications based on the analysis and comparison of current typical blockchain applications and frameworks, including digital currency blockchain, development platform blockchain, decentralized application and extended blockchain, helping developer create blockchain applications of a targeted manner and clarifying the functional architecture of different types of above various blockchain applications. Finally, the above classification method has been verified by the analysis of an extended blockchain.

AB Security is nonnegotiable key point for in-vehicle networking. However, all communication between Electrical Control Unites (ECU) still suffer from security drawbacks like highly processing time or preserving confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the feasibility of a private Blockchain technology to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. In this approach, we consider in-vehicle networking contains two parts, namely, central (or connected) gateway (cGW) and switches. cGW and switches are Blockchain nodes, wherein Blockchain consensus protocols are what keep all the nodes on a network synchronized with each other. The approach considers any communication type between ECUs as an individual event, which can be a transaction, data entry or application execution. A use case of secure communication between two ECUs is presented as an evaluation mechanism for securing in-vehicle networking using the proposed Blockchain approach.

AB Food products are one of most important elements in the international commerce. They are also one of the most regulated markets, both at national and international level. The potential damage that inadequate food products may cause in the economy, public health or natural environment of any country turns them into a very controlled commercial flow. However, methodologies, processes and instruments to apply these controls and trace the flow of food products through the several countries and states they can pass, are very complex and inefficient. Cultural and administrate problems, language conflicts or lost documents are only some of the main issues future digital food technologies should address. Therefore, in this paper it is proposed a traceability system for food products in the international commerce, based on Blockchain networks and RFID tags. Using REST interfaces, NoSQL databases and Java-Script code it is implemented a distributed solution to collect, sign and store trustworthy information about the food product flow. A security system is also deployed to guarantee the fault-resilience and the access only by authorized users to the system. A first implementation of the proposed system is also described in order to validate the described solution.

AB In recent years, blockchain technology has affected to a large extent all aspects of life, however, until now paper-based elections have been practiced. It is time to upgrade the election scenario using modern technology such as blockchain and advanced cryptography methods. Actually, both of Estonia and New South Wales have been using i-voting systems, but after developing an example software of their systems for the purpose of analysis, it is discovered that it has weaknesses against many kinds of attacks, such as malwares, network attacks, and servers attacks. The fact that the blockchain technology has demonstrated infinite immutability and resistance against hacking, so it is possible to use it to secure election results from fraud by saving every single piece of data, record or transaction with unchangeable history. By abandoning the traditional database and compensating it with two blockchains instead of one ensures voter/vote privacy, as well as, safeguards the results from manipulation. Also, using blockchain's distributed network reduces the load on the network. Finally, solutions to problems of impersonation and vote selling are suggested. The technology behind the digital voting system design is explained in terms of the processes involved, such as ID creation, authentication, voting, and vote tallying.

AB Blockchain is a relatively new technology, initially created for the Bitcoin's network to store transaction records happening in it. The system is redundant and distributed, making it difficult for fraudulent transactions. Beyond digital currencies, the blockchain concept has already demonstrated its potential in the insurance, health, digital identity, and many other areas. In order to deal with specific needs in those areas, a new technology has appeared-smart contracts-computational code programmed to meet and enforce certain conditions, like the ones seen in traditional contracts. Taking into account the benefits brought by blockchain and smart contracts, it is important to study their contributions to emerging technological solutions, like IoT ( Internet of Things), in which security, connectivity and interoperability are major concerns. This paper aims to describe relevant blockchain and smart contract's concepts, discussing their contribution to support and improve modern IoT solutions.

AB Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology first developed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The reason for the interest in this technology results from its decentralized nature, which provides security, anonymity and data integrity without any third-party organization in control of the transactions and, therefore, it creates interesting research areas. One of the business sectors that can benefit from this technology is healthcare. In this paper, we present and describe relevant aspects of the blockchain technology and we discuss some use cases in the healthcare area which might be improved by the use of this technology. To demonstrate its relevance to the healthcare sector, we present some real life examples of blockchain projects being developed to solve specific problems of this sector.

AB In this paper, we formulate the consensus problem and its solutions as seen in public blockchains and contrast them to those of the traditional distributed consensus. The Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm introduced in Bitcoin provides the first elegant and practical solution for reaching distributed consensus in a large-scale untrusted environment. Due to the enormous energy cost of PoW, many alternative consensus algorithms have been proposed for public blockchains aiming at drastically reducing the energy consumption for reaching consensus. We examine four blockchain consensus algorithms, namely Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Space, and Proof of Elapsed Time, with respect to the consensus model we have formulated and point out the challenges of adopting them in public blockchains.

AB Attribute-based access control makes access control decisions based on the assigned attributes of subjects and the access policies to protect objects by mediating operations from the subjects. Authority, which validates attributes of subjects, is one key component to facilitate attribute-based access control. In an increasingly decentralized society, multiple attributes possessed by subjects may need to be validated by multiple different authorities. This paper proposes a multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme by using Ethereum's smart contracts. In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object. The smart contracts for multi-authority attribute-based access control have been prototyped in Solidity, and their performance has been evaluated on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.

DE Blockchain; Ethereum; TomoChain; Proof of Stake; Voting; Randomization;
   Uniformity; Security Protocol
AB TomoChain(1) is a blockchain based on Ethereum framework with the following advantages points: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. In our previous technical white paper, we proposed Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus protocol, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees and fast finality. One of the key parts of PoSV is the double validation process, which requires randomization to generate the list of block verifiers (with uniform distribution and unpredictability) for each epoch. In other words, randomization of block verifiers in double validation is the key factor of reducing risks coming from paired hand-shaking attackers trying to commit malicious blocks.
   In this paper, we focus on studying methods for randomization of block verifiers. In particular, we study combinatorial and probability theory, and then apply the fixed-point-free permutation method for randomization. With this approach, we show that the contributions and benefits of verifiers are fair in the sense that the probability distribution function is uniform eventually. Finally, we implement the proposed protocol and conduct experiments on TomoChain public blockchain.

DE Inter-domain link state; Data sharing; Blockchain; Fake data prevention
AB Nowadays, the Internet has become a huge network composed of multiple autonomous systems (ASs) which are managed by various network operators. Network operators try to apply different network optimization technologies, based on link state information such as link bandwidth, link delay, to improve the network performance. However, inter-domain network optimization is hard to realize due to the lack of inter-domain link state information while one AS can only gather the link state information inside itself. Obviously, network information sharing among different ASs is necessary. Supporting for "trustless disintermediation", blockchain technology provides capabilities for cooperation among different ASs. We propose a new blockchain-based framework named BGP Link State Sharing Chain(BGP-LSChain), to help different AS owners sharing inter-domain link state. In this framework, we integrate a data verification mechanism and an AS credit rating mechanism to prevent fake data, which are realized by various smart contracts to control data sharing, data verification and credit rating. We implement an BGP-LSChain prototype and conduct experiments to evaluate it. The results show that while helping sharing data among different AS owners, the time cost of BGP-LSChain operations is within a reasonable and acceptable range.

AB Blockchain technology initially developed for transactions on cryptocurrencies is now gaining popularity in major domains such as education, healthcare, media, government, smart computing, and business enterprise. Blockchain manages the transactions database in a decentralized way replicated on all the nodes with no single governing authority. In this paper, we present a classification and taxonomy of different blockchain development platforms and simulators along with their consensus protocols, the types of supported blockchain networks and programming languages. We also assess the performance of a blockchain application for deployment at the UAE University (UAEU) versus increasing number of nodes, blocks and block size, on top of experimental network latencies and bandwidth between the nodes. Our results show that a large-scale deployment of blockchain at UAEU is feasible.

AB Digital currency has long been a hot and controversial topic in finance. Blockchain technology seems like having a promising application in finance, but there are both positive attitude and negative attitude towards digital currency. The meaning and status of digital currency are introduced in the paper. And the definition and characteristics of digital currency are given then. The investment of digital currency is analyzed according to the characteristics of digital currency. At last, based on the above analysis, this paper point out that the price of digital currency is higher than its value or its cost in 2017; digital currency is now not a safe-haven asset but a financial product with high risk and high income.

AB The innovative creation of cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology brings possibility for operating business in a decentralized community with reduced friction. But current business development on the blockchain platform is dragged by slow progress in technique, ill-designed economic mechanism, and difficult fund-raising procedure. Based on the analysis about major defects of Bitcoin's economic mechanism and the typical fund-raising methods in this field, we proposed a value-backed economic mechanism which has a clear separation of tokens' attributes as well as a reasonable distribution rule of profit. Rather than issuing a token with both utility and financing attributes at the very beginning, a utility token with a warrant attribute is introduced to stimulate and facilitate the value exchange between miners and other participants. After the business has become mature enough, token holders can redeem certain security tokens and start to enjoy dividends and other rights as a shareholder. In this way, speculation and fraud risks can be dramatically reduced, benefiting both project developers and investors.

AB In the digital Economy 'Data is the new oil. In the last decade technology has disrupted every filed imaginable. One such booming technology is Blockchain. A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. And once entered, the information is immutable. Ongoing projects and prior work in the fields of big data, data mining and data science has revealed how relevant data can be used to enhance products and services. There are uncountable applications and advantages of relevant data. The most valuable companies of today treat data as a commodity, which they trade and earn revenues.
   But use of relevant data has also drawn attention by the other non-conventional organizations and domains. To facilitate such trading, data marketplaces have emerged. In this paper we present a global data marketplace for users to easily buy and share data. The main focus of this research is to have a central data sharing platform for the recycling industry. This paper is a part of the research project "Recycling 4.0" which is focusing on sustainably improving the recycling process through exchange of information. We identify providing secure platform, data integrity and data quality as some major challenges for a data marketplace. In this paper we also explore how global data marketplace could be implemented using blockchain and similar technologies.

AB In the past few years block chain has gained lot of popularity because blockchain is the core technology of bitcoin. Its utilization cases are growing in number of fields such as security of Internet of Things (IoT), banking sector, industries and medical centres. Moreover, IoT has expanded its acceptance because of its deployment in smart homes and city developments round the world. Unfortunately, IoT network devices operate on limited computing power with low storage capacity and network bandwidth. Thus, they are extra close to attacks than other end-point devices such as cell phones, tablets, or PCs. This paper focus on addressing significant security issues of IoT and maps IoT security issues in contradiction of existing solutions found in the literature. Moreover issues that are not solved after implementation of blockchain are highlighted.

AB Number of internet connected devices is increasing as IoT is getting more prevalent. Volume of data collected by IoT sensors is very high and requires considerable resources for data processing like analytics. Edge processing enables getting the sensor data processed closer to the source. It's not always possible and/or economical to set up a resource intense infrastructure at the edge. This paper proposes use of blockchain based decentralized application to enable IoT edge processing. With this setup, it is possible for a resource owner to join the ecosystem and to lend the compute resources as needed. IoT devices can offload some of the edge computation to the resource owner nodes as and when required. This paper explains architectural components and overall solution for implementation. Based on the usecase of video analytics at edge, experimental setup is implemented for the IoT edge solution using hyperledger sawtooth blockchain.

AB With the process of the population aging, the problem of the aged in the urban is becoming increasingly prominent in China, especially the shortage of pension resources. In order to solve this problem, we proposed Volunteer time bank (VOLTimebank) based on blockchain, a novel distributed ledger that allows transactions without any third party organization. VOLTimebank is a record management system to handle volunteer service records. The system provides a channel for volunteers to serve the elderly and gives volunteers a way to exchange the services they can offer today with the services that they hope to get in the future. And a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism is used to select auditors, whose main task is to audit volunteers' services. Each holder of the (volunteer medals (VOLMedals) has the right to vote for auditors and be voted to be an auditor. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype implementation of VOLTimebank via smart contracts based on Ethereum. VOLTimebank is a true realization of "Serve today, enjoy tomorrow", encouraging more people to take part in the volunteer services, for the elderly and for themselves. This paper is intended to illustrate the ideas and methods of VOLTimebank.

AB The mandate of citizens for more socially responsible information systems that respect privacy and autonomy calls for a computational and storage decentralization. Crowd-sourced sensor networks monitor energy consumption and traffic jams. Distributed ledgers systems provide unprecedented opportunities to perform secure peer-to-peer transactions using blockchain. However, decentralized systems often show performance bottlenecks that undermine their broader adoption: propagating information in a network is costly and time-consuming. Optimization of cost-effectiveness with supervised machine learning is challenging. Training usually requires privacy-sensitive local data, for instance, adjusting the communication rate based on citizens' mobility. This paper studies the following research question: How feasible is to train with privacy-preserving aggregate data and test on local data to improve cost-effectiveness of a decentralized system? Centralized machine learning optimization strategies are applied to DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service and they are compared to decentralized self-adaptive strategies that use local data instead. Experimental evaluation with a testing set of 2184 decentralized networks of 3000 nodes aggregating real-world Smart Grid data confirms the feasibility of a linear regression strategy to improve both estimation accuracy and communication cost, while the other optimization strategies show trade-offs.

AB In the context of transportation technologies for smart city, recently, self-driving and connected cars have been studied with increased attention to realize more efficient and safer transportation. On the other hand, applications of blockchain and its Layer 2 technologies to IoT and cyber-physical systems have been considered for achieving sharing economy. The blockchain explores new incentive-based value exchange system using reliable data structure with resistance to information tampering despite the absence of reliable central control. In this paper, we propose a distributed system for collaborative traffic information gathering and sharing incentivized by blockchain technology. I consider that beacon devices are deployed along road segments by many and unspecified users. These devices collaboratively estimate traffic count and status, and also detect traffic jam and accidents to gather and share them coordinated by the incentive from its digital currency. After introducing an idea of how to realize this system, I demonstrate numerical simulations to evaluate some preliminary results for how the proposed system works and responds to real-time traffic conditions, such as traffic accident and jam in the road segment.

AB There are various methods and approaches to electronic voting all around the world. Each is connected with different benefits and issues. One of the most important and prevalent problems is lack of auditing capabilities and system verification methods. Blockchain technology, which recently gained a lot of attention, can provide a solution to this issue. This paper presents Auditable Blockchain Voting System (ABVS), which describes e-voting processes and components of a supervised internet voting system that is audit and verification capable. ABVS achieves this through utilization of blockchain technology and voter-verified paper audit trail.

AB The primary aim of food traceability is to increase food safety but traceability systems can also bring other benefits to production systems and supply chains. Technology has helped supply chain distribution to be successful and more competitive in the global market by improving their customers satisfaction level and providing more reasonable prices compared to their competitors. However, nowadays supply chains are long and complex and include many different actors, beginning with the farmers, followed by collectors, traders, manufacturers. At the end, the processed products are difficult to trace back to their origins in a trusted way. Best way so far is the continuous medial or legal documentation of the chain of transactions, available only to a limited circle of persons. The recent efforts toward blockchain-based trust management open a new perspective here. Here, we propose a solution to link legal documentation and blockchain technology within a traceability system, with the specific application case of cacao and chocolate production in mind. For improved data security, the common blockchain concept is extended to a two-factor blockchain, where both blockchains are connected via digital watermarking of the documentation media, one blockchain traces the documentation steps, the other the watermarking embedding. By a unique reading-verification approach, the integrity of their relatedness can be proven, thus improving also reliability of the whole product tracing.

AB Block chain is a decentralized core architecture, which is widely used in emerging digital encryption currencies. It has attracted much attention and has been researched with the gradual acceptance of bitcoin. Block chaining technology has the characteristics of centralization, block data, no tampering and trust, so it is sought after by enterprises, especially financial institutions. This paper expounds the core technology principle of block chain technology, discusses the application of block chain technology, the existing regulatory problems and security problems, so as to provide some help for the related research of block chain technology. Intrusion detection is an important way to protect the security of information systems. It has become the focus of security research in recent years. This paper introduces the history and current situation of intrusion detection system, expounds the classification of intrusion detection system and the framework of general intrusion detection, and discusses all kinds of intrusion detection technology in detail. Intrusion detection technology is a kind of security technology to protect network resources from hacker attack. IDS is a useful supplement to the firewall, which can help the network system to quickly detect attacks and improve the integrity of the information security infrastructure. In this paper, intrusion detection technology is applied to block chain information security model, and the results show that proposed model has higher detection efficiency and fault tolerance.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Blockchain's properties in addressing trust in highly decentralized environments can make it an enabler for novel sharing economy services. In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of blockchain-based Secure IoT as a Service ( SIoTaaS), where an IoT device can be rented from a service provider, securely and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our framework allows the simultaneous operations of distinct providers of IoT-based sharing economy services at a large scale. Multiple parties can securely share text and multimedia in the context of location and point-of-interest sharing, perform financial transactions by hiding true identity of parties involved in various online transactions, perform user and IoT registration, transfer value transactions via Ethereum tokens between providers and consumers, as well as raw IoT data payload. This can turn smart room IoT devices, such as smart locks, light bulbs, air conditioning and fans into rentable business entities within a secure sharing economy platform. We will demonstrate such a proof of concept IoT sharing economy framework, which is specifically designed to support the temporary IoT needs of very large numbers of users, such as Hajj pilgrims concentrating for a short period of time at a single area in Saudi Arabia.

TI Smart Contract Based Data Trading Mode Using Blockchain and Machine

DT Article
DE Data trading mode; smart contract; blockchain; machine learning;

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB There are two traditional data trading modes, the hosting mode, and the aggregation mode, which depend on the trusted third parties to a large extent. The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized. This paper presents the whole process of smart contract from the design and implementation to the test completion and provides the security analysis and performance evaluation. The full code of smart contract and the ABI interface have been uploaded to the GitHub for the public release.

AB The sharing of personal health records can help to improve the accuracy of the doctor's diagnosis and to promote the progress of medical research. Currently, to reduce the maintenance cost of data, personal health records are usually outsourced to a third party such as the cloud service provider. In this case, patients may lose direct control over their personal health records and the semi-trusted cloud service provider may tamper with or reveal personal health records. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management. In particular, the new scheme stores the hash values of encrypted personal health records in blockchain, and the related index set is stored in smart contract, which can further improve the efficiency of data integrity verification. Finally, performance evaluation and security analysis indicate that our scheme is secure and feasible for practical use.

AB In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an in fiuential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.

AB This paper presents a blockchain enabled secure data acquisition scheme utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm where data are collected from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and subsequently, forwarded to the nearest server through the UAV swarm. Before initiating data acquisition, the UAV swarm shares a shared key with the IoT devices in order to maintain communications. However, prior to transmitting data, the IoT devices encrypt the data and forward it to the UAV swarm. Upon receiving the data, the UAV swarm implements a two-phase validation utilizing the pi-hash bloom filter and the digital signature algorithm to validate the sender; in addition, prior to forwarding data to the nearest server, it performs encryption. However, before adding data in blockchain, consent from all validators is required. Finally, the data are stored in blockchain with the approval of validators. A security analysis is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is manifested through the implementation and simulation. The security analysis and the performance results show that UAV assist the IoT devices both in terms of connectivity and energy consumption, and provides security against the threats mentioned in the paper.

AB The widespread acceptance of data sharing has promoted the relevant research in both academia and industry. "Data sharing'' is the process of interchanging data among multiple data sources in a controllable access manner. Any such system provides common functionality of storage and access; however, there are prominent differences in non-functionalities, such as self-control, transparency, cost-effectiveness, incentive, and auditing, which make data sharing in a dilemma. In this paper, we propose a distributed data sharing model based on blockchain technology: data owner publishes data with an additional control policy; data consumer inquires data with an access request; and consensus nodes evaluate the request and make decisions. After formalizing the system model, we discuss the procedure of data sharing, reputation management, and proposed solution. With the access control policy, price compensation, and reputation management mechanism, we achieve self-control and price balance in sharing data. Our model is equally a closed-loop control system that acts as a regulator of supervising its participants. The analyses and experimental results show, comparing with the existing sharing systems, that our model is practical and can spur agents to participate actively in sharing data.

AB With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of "pre-verification" is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.

AB The great market success of Blockchain makes it an extremely valuable target for attackers. A well-known attack in Blockchain is the forking wrack, where divergent blockchains are produced for inserting some new features to facilitate security breaches. The state-of-the-art works mostly focus on how to detect attacks in real-time transactions, which is in hindsight and cannot deter the lOrking attack from the root. To take precautions, we employ the large deviation theory to study the vulnerability of blockchain networks incurred by intentional forks front a micro point of view, boosting forward-looking and strategic planning mechanisms for resisting the forking attack. Our study is fine-grained, because it offers not only the vulnerability probability of a blockchain network but also its decay speed, through which we find setting the parameter related to the robust level has more power than enhancing the computer power in speeding up the failure of attacks. This finding is valuable since it renders an opportunity to improve the robustness of a blockchain network in a cost-efficient way. Our analysis is comp/ementory, since it studies both the impacts of the computational power as well as the number of confirmations on the vulnerability of a blockchain network, providing a theoretical basis to design reasonable schemes for invigorating a blockchain network from technical as well as managerial levels. Extensive experiments carried out on a large-scale cloud plathirm running the Ethereum protocol show the experimental and analytical results match well, verifying the effectiveness of our analysis.

AB As part of its ongoing efforts to meet the increased spectrum demand, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recently opened up 150 MHz in the 3.5 GHz hand for shared wireless broadband use. Access and operations in this band, aka Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) to enable seamless spectrum sharing between secondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. Despite its benefits, SAS's design requirements, as set by FCC, present privacy risks to SUs, merely because SUs are required to share sensitive operational information (e.g., location, identity, spectrum usage) with SAS to be able to learn about spectrum availability in their vicinity. In this paper, we propose TrustSAS, a trustworthy framework lOr SAS that synergizes state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques with blockchain technology in an innovative way to address these privacy issues while complying with FCC's regulatory design requirements. We analyze the security of our framework and evaluate its performance through analysis, simulation and experimentation. We show that TrustSAS can offer high security guarantees with reasonable overhead, making it an ideal solution for addressing SUs' privacy issues in an operational SAS environment.

AB Traditional cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) suffers from lacking a trustworthy platform for automatic enforcement. The emerging blockchain technique brings in an immutable solution for tracking transactions among business partners. However, it is still very challenging to prove the credibility of possible violations in the SLA before recording them onto the blockchain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a witness model using game theory and the smart contract techniques. The proposed model extends the existing service model with a new role called "witness" for detecting and reporting service violations. Witnesses gain revenue as an incentive for performing these duties, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that trustworthiness is guaranteed: in order to get the maximum profit, the witness has to always tell the truth. This is analyzed and proved through game theory using the Nash equilibrium principle. In addition, an unbiased sortition algorithm is proposed to ensure the randomness of the independent witnesses selection from the decentralized witness pool, to avoid possible unfairness or collusion. An auditing mechanism is also introduced in the paper to detect potential irrational or malicious witnesses. We have prototyped the system leveraging the smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model and indicate good performance in accordance with the design expectations.

AB The Bitcoin blockchain is a secure, distributed ledger that enables trusted transactions across untrusted entities. However, many applications need much faster transaction confirmation than that of the current Bitcoin blockchain. In this paper, we present a high-throughput, low-latency, deterministic confirmation mechanism called ACCEL for accelerating Bitcoin's block confirmation mechanism. Our key idea for achieving faster confirmation is the quick identification of singular blocks that provably belong to the blockchain. While it is impossible to determine with certainty if a block belongs to a blockchain when network delays are unbounded, singular block detection exploits the fact that the end-to-end latency between Bitcoin miners is substantially lower than the inter-block spacing and can be assumed to be upper bounded. ACCEL is especially suitable for low-latency, permissioned blockchains, where the block spacing can he optimized to the blockchain's small latencies to greatly improve throughput. We evaluate ACCEL's performance with extensive simulations and with a real implementation built with minimal changes to and fully compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain. We show that with appropriate bounds on the end-to-end latency, it is possible to reduce transaction confirmation latencies to milliseconds with ACCEL, and so meet the performance needs of a wide range of applications.

AB We present a decentralised solution for managing scientific communication, based on distributed ledger technologies, also called blockchains. The proposed system aims to solve incentive problems displayed by traditional systems in scientific communication and publication. A minimal working model is presented, defining roles, processes, and expected results from the novel system. The proposed solution is viable, given the current status of blockchain technology, and should lead to a rethinking of current practices and their consequences for scientific communication.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger of records called as blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptographic hash. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Consensus layer is the main layer in Blockchain Architecture, in which consensus protocol is configured to decide how new block is added in blockchain. Consensus algorithm solves the problem of trust in blockchain. Consensus algorithms can be classified into two classes. The first class is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the blockchain network to broadcast their results of mining a new block or transaction, before appending the block to blockchain. The second class is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the blockchain network to solve and mathematical puzzle to show that they are more eligible than the others to do the appending or mining work. Performance of blockchain can be increased with the use of suitable consensus algorithm. However, theory and data support for the selecting suitable consensus in private blockchain is very limited. This paper contributes theory and data used for selecting suitable consensus algorithm and would help researchers for further exploring of consensus in private blockchain environment.

AB Since the concept of Indonesia as the world's maritime fulcrum was initiated in 2014, the Government of Indonesia has begun to quickly formulate Indonesia's maritime connectivity policy. Indonesia's so-called "sea highway" (Tol Laut) program is one of them. However, this policy is considered to be less effective in solving logistical distribution chain problems which often caused the high price of basic goods in the market. Based on the results of the authors' observation, the process of dismantling containers at Indonesian ports can take more than 4 days. This is quite alarming, Indonesian port is the key to logistics distribution both between Indonesian islands and the international world, yet the condition. Therefore, the writing team formulated a concept of Indonesian "E-Toll Laut" (sea e-highway) policy as an e-governance solution to improve port management in Indonesia. E-Toll Laut itself is a name that the team of authors designates to explain the mechanism of blockchain port management in Indonesia. Based on the author's research team, this system is proven to be able to guarantee accountability, simplify the monitoring process, and accelerate bureaucratic processes and port transactions that are considered as accidents of the dwelling time process in Indonesia. The writing team then used Makassar port as a case study to give clearer picture for the problem.

AB The transmission and tabulation of results are critical steps in the election process. If election results are provided quickly and transparently, they may inspire trust and confidence in the overall management of the contest. On the contrary, the late and questionable delivery of results might raise concerns and suspicion. In some cases, improper counting and tabulation procedures have brought candidates to question election results and even spurred long periods of violence. In this paper, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the counting and tabulation procedures during elections. Blockchains are distributed ledgers technologies whose transactions are protected cryptographically. It means that their contents cannot be tampered with nor modified in the long term. We argue that blockchain technology meets the requirements for electronic transmission and consolidation of election results. To prove so, we have implemented a proof of concept with a smart contract running on an Ethereum blockchain that registers the address of several polling stations and records the tally sheets that these submit at the end of the election. We also resort to the smart contract for the automatic and accurate consolidation of the election results once they have been submitted.

DE Blockchain technology; electronic health records; information sharing
AB The role of record keeping and information sharing in the health sector cannot be overemphasized. More recently, there has been renewed interest in finding a solution to the issues pertaining to privacy of health records and how these records can be easily accessed by different healthcare providers in healthcare-service delivery. Thus, such records comprise an individual's health history and other information that facilitates healthcare decisions. Furthermore, easy access to a patient's health information is an important aspect of health-service delivery that must be regulated and monitored because of the sensitivity of the information. Current approaches adopted in many hospitals face challenges of missing files, or records, lack of information sharing between healthcare providers, insecure records and also inaccessibility of patients' health information for healthcare providers that are needed to make informed health decisions. Building from a case study grounded in interviews and document review, we propose a scalable framework that supports the adoption of blockchain technology in addressing the issues of privacy, information sharing, and record keeping in the health sector.

AB Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing-or the insertion of data in the blockchain (anchoring)- is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of data hashing (anchoring) on the blockchain for public state-owned registries. This paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as "distributed ledger technology" and "permissioned blockchains." Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need to identify pain points in governance in the first place, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.

   Conceptual Fit; Blockchain-enabled Governance
ID TECHNOLOGY; BENEFITS
AB New Public Governance (NPG) as a paradigm for collaborative forms of public service delivery and Blockchain governance are trending topics for researchers and practitioners alike. Thus far, each topic has, on the whole, been discussed separately. This paper presents the preliminary results of ongoing research which aims to shed light on the more concrete benefits of Blockchain for the purpose of NPG. For the first time, a conceptual analysis is conducted on process level to spot benefits and limitations of Blockchain-based governance. Per process element, Blockchain key characteristics are mapped to functional aspects of NPG from a governance perspective. The preliminary results show that Blockchain offers valuable support for governments seeking methods to effectively coordinate co-producing networks. However, the extent of benefits of Blockchain varies across the process elements. It becomes evident that there is a need for off-chain processes. It is, therefore, argued in favour of intensifying research on off-chain governance processes to better understand the implications for and influences on on-chain governance.
