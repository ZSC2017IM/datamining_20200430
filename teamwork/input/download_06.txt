AB In this work we investigate which aspects of data protection regulation must be carefully observed when implementing Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. This technology provides interesting properties and allows governments to develop flexible and innovative data management systems. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of using Blockchains requires understanding the government processes along with the legal framework and political setting imposed on government. Though it is a buzzword, Blockchain may not always be the best solution for data processing, and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment could allow an analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the mechanism. Furthermore, principles relating to security of data remain applicable to Blockchains. We discuss points of interaction between Blockchain technology and the European Union data protection framework, and provide recommendations on how to better develop Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. The findings of the study should provide public sector actors with a guideline to assess the real necessity and better format of a Blockchain-based application.

AB Smart Contracts, which derive from Blockchain technology, are one of the most peremptory applications of this. However, as it is a very recent technology, investors' uncertainty and fear makes their development slowly and cautiously. There are, therefore, a number of questions and legal problems that arise. The paper identifies what revolution Blockchain adds to the contractual processes, exploring its potential and analysing the main legal difficulties it is facing. It seeks the analysis of the pros and cons of this new technology, specially the questions about enforcement, nature and form, consent and (in) flexibility. The purpose of this investigation is to recognize the nature of this technology and its impact on the Contract Law. And because of this, the impact and challenges that it brings to the Governance of a nation as well as on private companies and individuals. Therefore this study is based mostly in the review of already existing embryonic laws about Blockchain technology or similar, authors that wrote about Smart Contracts and also some recent news to show the social and economic impact in the world. In short, the subject that this paper presents is the beginning of a true technological, social and economic revolution that must be anticipated and prepared by the law and those who work with it.

AB Majority of small and marginal farmers in developing countries depend mainly on dairy production. In cooperative model, members are empowered to govern their own organizations and electing its members to assume roles in governance structure need verification of their eligibilities. This process needs transparent validation of their eligibility and it is argued that block chain architecture would be helpful. In this paper, a conceptual framework is presented to relate E-Governance to block chain to explore feasibility of relating to efficient governance by bringing more transparency. In order to explore this, dairy cooperative sector is taken up and E-Governance services are assessed with service oriented architecture framework. Case of dairy cooperative society union is taken up to apply this conceptual framework and understand feasibility applying block chain principles.

AB Blockchain technologies are in the ascendant of transforming the ways we manage contracts, make transactions, and manifest ownership of property. The trend calls for a realistic testing and evaluation platform for blockchain applications and systems. We present Minichain, a container-based emulator that allows testing proof-of-work-based blockchains on a commodity computer. Minichain contains a realistic and configurable network environment, which is missing in today's blockchain testbeds. This unique feature enables us to evaluate the impact of network events (e.g., cyber-attacks) and conditions (e.g., congested or failed links) on blockchain applications. Meanwhile, Minichain allows the direct execution of unmodified application code in the containers for fidelity, and utilizes the virtual time technique to speed up experiments and improve the system scale that one can accurately emulate. In particular, we mathematically analyze the convergence of the proof-of-work-based consensus algorithm to show the effectiveness of virtual time. We evaluate the performance of Minichain across both network layer and application layer, and demonstrate its usability by emulating a selfish mining attack initiated from the network layer.

DE Blockchain; binary integrity protection; revocation
AB The integrity of executable binaries is essential to the security of any device that runs them. At best, a manipulated binary can leave the system in question open to attack, and at worst, it can compromise the entire system by itself. In recent years, supply-chain attacks have demonstrated that binaries can even be compromised unbeknownst to their creators. This, in turn, leads to the dissemination of supposedly valid binaries that need to be revoked later.
   In this paper, we present and evaluate a concept for publishing and revoking integrity protecting information for binaries, based on the Ethereum Blockchain and its underlying peer-to-peer network. Smart Contracts are used to enforce access control over the publication and revocation of integrity preserving information, whereas the peer-to-peer network serves as a fast, global communication service to keep user clients informed. The Ethereum Blockchain serves as a tamper-evident, publicly-verifiable log of published and revoked binaries. Our implementation incurs costs comparable to registration fees for centralised software distribution platforms but allows publication and revocation of individual binaries within minutes. The proposed concept can be integrated incrementally into existing software distribution platforms, such as package repositories or various app stores.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a rapidly-growing transformative expansion of the Internet with increasing influence on our daily life. Since the number of "things" is expected to soon surpass human population, control and automation of IoT devices has received considerable attention from academia and industry. Cross-platform collaboration is highly desirable for better user experience due to fragmentation of user needs and vendor products with time. Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans. This approach incorporates the preferences of participating platforms and end users, and opens new avenues for collaborative edge computing as well as research on blockchain-based access control mechanism for IoT environments.

AB According to the World Economic Forum, the water crisis ranks among the five most dangerous risks to global welfare. In this context, water governance is becoming increasingly vital in various regions, especially as the multiple and competitive uses of water mount increasing pressures on its supply. Despite the evolution of water governance rationales, global water resources are, unfortunately deteriorating. Current water governance models are limited by two intertwined aspects: financial sources and trust. In this context, the objective of this paper is to discuss how blockchain technology can aid in improving water governance, increasing financial transparency, and stakeholders' trust. Such an improvement could be achieved, for example, with the creation of cryptocurrencies to encourage actions aimed at the conservation of water resources, and also via the adoption of smart contracts.

AB Blockchain technology holds great promise to rewire the current financial system which relies on the third party. Every transaction is recorded in a secure and transparent for the parties in the blockchain network. Blockchain technology in the energy sector becomes an interesting topic among researchers at this moment. The use of blockchain allows producers and consumers to trade energy transactions through smart grids because of a decentralized energy trading system. The trading activities without a third party involved would reduce the cost of a transaction thus it brings to a new level of quality of service in the trading system. In this paper, we propose an architectural model for decentralized energy trading system among the neighbors that allows the producer who has the surplus energy to conduct a trading activity with his/her neighbors. The transactions manage by the miners in the same blockchain network. Moreover, we analyze the security issues from various attacks and presenting the performance of the selected attack that might occur in the model.

AB This paper presents a distributed payment system based on payment tokens using Blockchain technology; these payment tokens protect the consumer from identity theft by unauthorized usage of his payment card details (PAN,CVV), due to mismanagements from other parties of the payment system. Furthermore, a private Blockchain consortium consolidates the security and privacy of the proposed payment system; this consortium consists of a private Blockchain called Bank Authority that acts as the interoperability domain, in addition to two other private Blockchains, each serves as the acquirer Bank and the issuer Bank, respectively, the security of this payment system is reinforced by introducing special nodes that verify and validate transactions, in order to detect and block fraud attempts. Moreover, to keep the payment system confidentiality and protect the economic interests of all the Banks in the system, only the transaction hash is recorded in the consortium's Blockchain and only the Banks involved in a transaction will have access to its details.

TI Flexible and Efficient Blockchain-Based ABE Scheme With Multi-Authority

AB Telemedicine offers a medical-on-demand (MoD) service from a distance. This technology is designed to overcome distance barriers and improve the process of accessing medical services in distant rural communities. With the development of cloud computing, the MoD services in the telemedicine system are provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This CSP connects the patient and the medical staff in different places with both convenience and fidelity. Meanwhile, the outsourcing healthcare data on public cloud platforms bring some new challenges on the security. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) algorithm realizes flexible and fine-grained access control, a large number of patients subscribe or unsubscribe the different medical services frequently in the cloud, which takes a huge cost for membership management. In this paper, an ABE scheme is presented to achieve the dynamic authentication and authorization with higher flexibility and efficiency for the MoD services in telemedicine system. On the one hand, when the patient alters his ordered service, it requires no updating on the parameters for those whose statuses remain unchanged. We construct an independent-update key policy ABE scheme in the distributed telemedicine system that aims to updates patient's keys separately, and there are multiple authorities to manage this system altogether which is more similar to the real situation. On the other hand, by using blockchain and distributed database technologies, the private healthcare data stored in public cloud is protected in integrity, which avoids the misdiagnosis accident from the inaccurate electronic health records distorted by a malicious user or authority from the inner cloud. Finally, we analyze the collusion attack in multiple authorities and formally prove the security of this protocol in a standard model. After comparing and simulating, the results of this work show a better performance.

   optimization for storage mechanism
AB Blockchain has a broad development potential and application prospects. At present, huge storage volume on each node has become one of the primary bottlenecks that restrict the expansibility of blockchain. Optimization for storage mechanism has become a necessary way to accelerate the improvement of blockchain. There are a variety of solutions to relieve the storage burden by modifying the architecture of blockchain, but most of them weaken the decentralization property of the system, which is the core advantages of the blockchain. In this paper, an optimization scheme based on the redundant residual number system is proposed to dramatically reduce the storage volume of nodes in the blockchain system, and fault tolerance mechanism is designed based on the new storage scheme. The simulation experiments are performed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

TI ScanAT: Identification of Bytecode-Only Smart Contracts With Multiple

SO IEEE ACCESS

   networks
AB Smart contracts on blockchain systems implement business logic and directly handle important assets. Although smart contracts play these critical roles, it is hard for users interacting with the system to understand the real behavior of the deployed bytecodes of smart contracts. The quirks of smart contracts, such as code reuse and limited unique datasets, make it challenging to recognize the functional details of smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a new method for characterizing bytecode-only smart contracts by automatically assigning multiple attribute tags. Using a deep learning approach, our system, the ScanAT, extracts attribute tags from the source code and metadata of known smart contracts and trains their bytecode with the attribute tags. The ScanAT then infers attribute tags from the bytecode of smart contracts alone. Our experiments show that ScanAT can achieve 81% accuracy in predicting attribute tags, using convolutional neural networks and a customized autoencoder.

AB With the exponential growth in the number of insecure devices, the impact of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is growing rapidly. Existing DDoS mitigation schemes are facing obstacles due to low flexibility, lack of resources, and high cost. The new emerging technologies, such as blockchain, introduce new opportunities for low-cost, efficient and flexible DDoS attacks mitigation across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach, called Cochain-SC, which combines two levels of mitigation, intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. For intra-domain, we propose an effective DDoS mitigation method in the context of software defined networks (SDN); it consists of three schemes: (1) Intra Entropy-based scheme (I-ES) to measure, using sFlow, the randomness of data inside the domain; (2) Intra Bayes-based scheme (I-BS) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate flows; and (3) Intra-domain Mitigation (I-DM) scheme to effectively mitigate illegitimate flows inside the domain. For inter-domain, we propose a collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme based on blockchain; it uses the concept of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum's smart contracts) to facilitate the collaboration among SDN-based domains (i.e., Autonomous System: AS) to mitigate DDoS attacks. For this aim, we design a novel and secure scheme that allows multiple SDN-based domains to securely collaborate and transfer attack information in a decentralized manner. Combining intra- and inter-domain DDoS mitigation, Cochain-SC allows an efficient mitigation along the path of an ongoing attack and an effective mitigation near the origin of the attack. This allows reducing the enormous cost of forwarding packets, across multiple domains, which consist mostly of useless amplified attack traffic. To the best of our knowledge, Cochain-SC is the first scheme that proposes to deal with both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation combining SDN, blockchain and smart contract. The implementation of Cochain-SC is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach; the experimental results show that Cochain-SC achieves flexibility, efficiency, security, cost effectiveness, and high accuracy in detecting illegitimate flows, making it a promising approach to mitigate DDoS attacks.

AB A Potential solution for solving forensic is the use of blockchain in software-defined networking (SDN). The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer network that can be utilized on SDN-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments for security provisioning. Hence, to meet some challenges in digital forensics such as data integrity, evidence deletion or alteration, blockchain is used. However, some problems such as poor attack detection and slow processing existed in previous works. To address these issues, an efficient forensics architecture is proposed in SDN-IoT that establishes the Chain of Custody (CoC) in blockchain technology. The proposed SDN-based IoT architecture is initiated with flow table rules on switches for the three different traffics Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In this work, overloaded switches migrate the packets to nearby switches to balance the packet flow. The packets disobeying flow rules will be discarded by switches. The blockchain-based distributed controller in this forensic architecture is designed to use the Linear Homomorphic Signature (LHS) algorithm for validating users. Each controller is fed with a classifier that uses the Neuro Multi-fuzzy to classify malicious packets based on packet features. The logs of events are used and stored on the blockchain in the proposed SDN-IoT architecture. We evaluated the performance of our forensic architecture and compared it to the existing model using various performance measures. Our evaluation results demonstrate performance improvement by reducing delay, response time and processing time, increasing throughput, accuracy, and security parameters.

AB Following the rapid development and the maturity of blockchain (BC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper proposes two applications of a BC-IoT transaction model in the accounting field. The BC-IoT transaction model is capable of automatically collecting, uploading, and recording all relevant data in the enterprise transaction process under the premise of satisfying certain assumptions. This model does not require manual intervention at any point in the process; no data recorded on the distributed ledgers can be tampered with or revoked. The data collected using this model can be used as information on events, providing data support for the events approach to basic accounting theory. This practice responds to the important insight of sorter, who proposes the provision of accounting information in real time and on demand to substantially improve the usefulness of accounting information. This paper also identifies that BC technology can significantly improve the relevance, faithful representation, timeliness, comparability, and other aspects of accounting information quality.

AB Wireless Virtualization (WiVi) is emerging as a new paradigm to provide high speed communications and meet Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of users while reducing the deployment cost of wireless infrastructure for future wireless networks. In WiVi, Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs) sublease their RF channels through slicing to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) based on their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the MVNOs independently provide wireless services to their end users. This paper investigates the wireless network virtualization by leveraging both Blockchain technology and machine learning to optimally allocate wireless resources. To eliminate double spending (aka over-committing) of WIPs' wireless resources such as RF channels, Blockchain - a distributed ledger - technology is used where a reputation is used to penalize WIPs with past double spending habit. The proposed reputation based approach helps to minimize extra delay caused by double spending attempts and Blockchain operations. To optimally predict the QoS requirements of MVNOs for their users, linear regression - a machine learning approach - is used that helps to minimize the latency introduced due to (multiple wrong) negotiations for SLAs. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out by using numerical results obtained from simulations. Results have shown that the joint Blockchain and machine learning based approach outperforms the other approaches.

AB Physical layer security (PLS) is considered as a promising technique to prevent information eavesdropping in wireless systems. In this context, cooperative relaying has emerged as a robust solution for achieving PLS due to multipath diversity and relatively lower transmission power. However, relays or the relay operators in the practical environment are unwilling for service provisioning unless they are incentivized for their cost of services. Thus, it is required to jointly consider network economics and relay cooperation to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint network economics and PLS using cooperative relaying and jamming. Based on the double auction theory, we model the interaction between transmitters seeking for a particular level of secure transmission of information and relay operators for suitable relay and jammer assignment, in a multiple source-destination networks. In addition, theoretical analyses are presented to justify that the proposed auction mechanism satisfies the desirable economic properties of individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. As the participants in the traditional centralized auction framework may take selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a decentralized and trustless auction framework based on blockchain technology. In particular, we exploit the smart contract feature of blockchain to construct a completely autonomous framework, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. The security properties of the proposed framework are also discussed.

AB European Regulation (EU) 910/2014 lays down the rules for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Qualified Electronic Registered Delivery is one of the trust services included in the regulation, and it requires nonrepudiation of origin and reception together with the integrity of the data. This kind of services usually relies heavily on the use of trusted third parties. These entities are an obstacle to extend the use of protocols. In this paper, we use the blockchain-based technologies to provide, for the first time, two multiparty registered eDelivery schemes that reduce the involvement of trusted third parties compared with traditional approaches while satisfying the requirements of the norms created by the European Union for registered eDeliveries. Since confidentiality is not considered a compulsory property in the directive, we propose two protocols. The first one is well suited for those deliveries that do not require the confidentiality of the message or delivered data or even for those in which it is required that the message can be public and accessible to everybody. The second solution for multiparty registered eDelivery allows the message to be hidden to others than the receiver. We present the smart contracts for both proposals and also a complete analysis of their properties and performance.

AB Cognitive radio (CR)-based Internet of Things (IoT) system is an effective step toward a world of smart technology. Many frameworks have been proposed to build CR-based IoT systems. The CR-based IoT frameworks are the key points on which this survey focuses. Efficient spectrum sensing and sharing are the main functional components of the CR-based IoT. Reviews of recent SS and sharing approaches are presented in this survey. This survey classifies the SS and sharing approaches and discusses the merits and limitations of those approaches. Moreover, this survey discusses the design factors of the CR-based IoT and the criteria by which the proper SS and access approaches are selected. Furthermore, the survey explores the integration of newly emerging technologies with the CR-based IoT systems. Finally, the survey highlights some emerging challenges and concludes with suggesting future research directions and open issues.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency proposed by a developer hided under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, and it is relied on a peer-to-peer payment system created as an open source software. It is relied on blockchain a distributed and democratically-sustained public register of the transactions. Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has a lower transaction cost and greater security and scalability than fiat money and no need of a central bank. However, in the last years several researchers have relived environmental issues related to the use of this money. On the contrary, the relate technology of blockchain is recognizing as a significant tool contributing to create a more sustainable world. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to describe and evaluate the sustainability of the Bitcoin currency and the blockchain technology considering the environmental and social impacts due to energy consumption, market diffusion compared to fiat currency. Blockchain can reduce and accelerate bureaucracy processes as well as incentivize environmentally friendly behaviour. Under these perspectives, blockchain may show the full applicability of sustainability in the economic, environmental and social sectors.

AB The next generation of vehicles will be autonomous, connected, electric, and intelligent with distinct requirements such as high mobility, low latency, real-time applications, seamless connectivity, and security. Blockchain can provide a good solution to the issue of secure message dissemination or secure information sharing in vehicular networks with a weak trust relationship among the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the design of a regional blockchain for VANETs, where the blockchain is shared among nodes in a geographically bounded area. We investigate how to design the regional blockchain while achieving a low 51% attack success probability. We derive a condition that guarantees a low 51% attack success probability in terms of the numbers of good nodes and malicious nodes, the message delivery time, and the puzzle computation time. The condition can provide a useful guideline for selection of several control parameters guaranteeing the stable operation of the blockchain. We run several simulations to show the validity of the condition and investigate the effects of various parameters on the 51% attack success probability. Our analysis and simulation results show that maintaining a low message delivery time for good nodes is very important in protecting the stability of the blockchain system.

AB The development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has facilitated adaptive traffic signal control for intelligent transportation. In this paper, we proposed the traffic signal control mechanism based on a consortium blockchain, which has saved plenty of financial and material resources. It has solved the centralization problems and minimized the high degree of human intervention in the process of traffic signal light management. As a road is congested, the vehicle forwards road condition messages. The traffic department (TD) adjusts the signal light duration to allow the synergistic optimization management, and control the traffic vehicle status through a smart contract. In addition, we propose a credibility mechanism to effectively prevent vehicles from broadcasting mendacious messages and malicious requests, thereby enhancing the credibility of vehicles and providing a secure and trustworthy communication environment for the VANETs. It is hazardous for vehicles to send plaintext messages in an open environment because their privacy and security are threatened. Thus, we utilize ElGamal encryption and group signature algorithm to guarantee the confidentiality, privacy, and non-repudiation of any information. The safety analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the scheme is feasible and valid, and it can facilitate the adaptive control of traffic signal lights.

AB A Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) is a self-organized network, formed by vehicles and some fixed equipment on roads called Roads Side Units (RSUs). Vehicular communications are expected to share different kinds of information between vehicles and infrastructure. Because of these specifications, securing VANET constitutes a difficult and challenging task that has attracted the interest of many researchers. In a previous work, we proposed a Clustering Mechanism for VANET (CMV) and its inherit Trust management scheme (TCMV) to ensure security of communication among vehicles. CMV organizes vehicles into clusters and elected Cluster Heads (CHs), and allows the clusters maintenance while dealing with velocity. On the other side, TCMV computes the credibility of the message by CH using the reputation of vehicles. However, we found that the value of credibility of the message by CH is not enough to verify if an exchanged message is correct or no. In order to provide a secured vehicle communication and to build reliance communication among vehicles, we propose a distributive trust management scheme for VANET to verify the correctness of the message based on the controlling of the vehicle'behavior by a miner and the credibility of message by a CH.

DE Darknet product sales; bitcoin monitoring; web scraping
AB Anonymity networks and hidden services like those accessible in Tor, also called the "darknet", in combination with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin provide a relatively safe environment for criminal online activities. While this is a challenge for law enforcement, it brings opportunities for researchers to monitor these activities as they are often not really hidden but rather obfuscated and/or anonymized. In this paper we discuss such a monitoring approach for product sales in the darknet. We collect bitcoin addresses and data about product offerings in a number of shops run as hidden services in Tor. We then analyze transactions in the bitcoin blockchain that can be mapped to specific product sales in these shops.

DE Zero Knowledge Proof; Blockchain; Data Confidentiality; Fair Exchange;
   Witness Indistinguishability
AB Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party (TTP) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work (PoW), blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also, the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash, ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK, an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with ZKSTARK to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from SHA3-finalists based on their security, performance and inner designs.

   key; Secret Sharing; Digital Signatures
AB Immutability is a core principle of blockchain platforms that help all participants to have an exact global log of transactions. Immutability is easier to achieve in permissioned blockchain platforms where a trusted group are the validators. In public platforms, this vital property of blockchain can be achieved only through decentralized economic mechanisms like Proof-of-Work(PoW). Blockchain along with the concept of asset tokenization provides liquidity to markets like stock trading and exchange other intangible objects. With changes in regulatory policies and/or government laws, there could be a requisite to alter the contents in such markets. We propose an idea of using Chameleon hash functions that will enable modification of a block without changing other block contents. In our proposal, the trapdoor key used to redact a block is split among major validators and is reconstructed using Multi-Party Computation(MPC). Redaction happens when the major validators agree the suggested changes by digitally signing the proposal. This eliminates the need to rely on a trusted party. We also propose an idea of using second trapdoor key that will be with the creator of the block. This can be used in scenarios where the block redaction should not happen without the consent of the creator.

ID TRUST
AB As of today, most of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices work in a centralized environment. With IoT devices having to execute thousands of operations per second, it has become difficult for centralized systems to handle such platforms. Also, factors like operational and maintenance cost of these server machines and danger of DoS(Denial of Service) attack on such servers has threatened the practitioners to come up with a more distributed way of storing the contents. With its decentralized and privacy preserving features, blockchain technology fits well into the scheme of things. This mitigates the quintessential challenges faced in most of the centralized systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the new firmware update scheme to perform the update operations securely. We propose a blockchain based solution for managing firmware updates in IoT. Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor. The PUSH-based method is used for a firmware update in which verification of firmware is done by Hash Chain. It preserves the integrity of firmware by linking the latest version information by previous versions information with the help of a smart contract mechanism.

AB In this era of rapid growth of vehicles, the ratio of road accident increases day by day. Nowadays, Traffic incidents are persistent problems in both developed and developing countries which result in huge loss of life and property. No one in this world is ready to gaze what's happening around them. Nobody cares even when an accident occurs. This paper provides an innovative solution by developing an Accident Alert Message System using an Android Smartphone Application that can be used from the accident zone. The application uses GPS technology for location mapping and sends an alert and notification of an accident. The generated accident alert message is endorsed by the nearby registered users who also witness the accident to ensure the increased reputation of the message. Based on the endorsement of the message, the system will instantly transmit the location of the accident to the nearby emergency services. In this case, users usually lack the enthusiasm to generate or endorse alert messages because they might fear that their privacy will be breached. At the same time, users do not benefit from generating or endorsing alert messages which also makes them lack the enthusiasm or motivation to respond to messages. In order to provide a solution to resolve these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-preserving Blockchain Based Incentive Mechanism for Accident Alert Message System. The main objective of the paper is to encourage the users to generate and endorse accident alert messages from the accident zone without revealing the user's identity. Also, some incentives to the users are paid to the message generators and endorsers and the transactions get stored based on the Blockchain technology; hence the privacy of the user is preserved. Our proposed system ensures the reliability of alert messages without revealing the privacy of the user and is reliable and efficient in the non-fully-trusted environment.

ID ATTACKS
AB Electronic health records possess the patient's medication details and their health history. The health records attract the attention of the attackers' as it possesses invaluable information. Loss of electronic health record leads to a wrong medication or surgery. Healthcare systems provide fewer security measures to secure the health records. Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that plays a vital role in securing the data and transactions. Introduction of blockchain in the healthcare systems protects the health records from the attackers. However, the blockchain faces phishing, dictionary based, cold wallets, and hot wallets attacks. This paper proposes a multilevel authentication-based scheme to protect the blockchain from the attacks mentioned above.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted much attention due to the great success of the cryptocurrencies. Owing to its immutability property and consensus protocol, blockchain offers a new solution for trusted storage and computation services. To scale up the services, prior research has suggested a hybrid storage architecture, where only small meta-data are stored on chain and the raw data are outsourced to off-chain storage. To protect data integrity, a cryptographic proof can be constructed online for queries over the data stored in the system. However, the previous schemes only support simple key-value queries. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying authenticated range queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain. The key challenge lies in how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that can be efficiently maintained by the blockchain, in which a unique gas cost model is employed. By analyzing the performance of the existing techniques, we propose a novel ADS, called GEM(2)-tree, which is not only gas-efficient but also effective in supporting authenticated queries. To further reduce the ADS maintenance cost without sacrificing much the query performance, we also propose an optimized structure, GEM(2)*-tree, by designing a two-level index structure. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation validate the performance of the proposed ADSs.

DE Blockchain database; relational semantics; query processing; data
   storage
AB Blockchain has been adopted in many applications to construct trust among multiple participants, such as supply chain management, digital assets transfer, philanthropy, etc. Blockchain platforms are often used as decentralized databases. However, existing blockchain platforms are far less convenient to use than traditional databases. They are lack of the capability of modelling complex tasks conveniently and efficiently, especially when both on -chain and off -chain data are involved at the same time. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel blockehain database, called SEBDB, which leverages the existing databases' functionality which are optimized 14 decades. Comparing to existing works, SEIMB is the first platform which considers both useability and scalability. Specifically, first, we add relational data semantics into blockchain platform, where each transaction is a tuple with multiple attributes in a pre -defined table. Second, we use SQL -like language as the general interface, instead of code -level APIs, to support convenient application development, in which intrinsic operations are re -defined and re -implemented to suit for blockchain platform. Third, as RDBMS has achieved great success in the past decades, our system, though not relying on RDBMS, treats it as an important component. Finally, we define a mini -benchmark to evaluate the performance of the blockchain database. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system.

AB In this paper, we introduce an integrated smart parking system. The proposed integrated smart parking system brings multiple parking service providers together under a unified platform aiming to provide one-stop parking information services to the commuters in a smart city. However, the adaptation of such a system is prone to tempering while a massive amount of data is shared among different parties which raise concerns related to trust and performance. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based architecture specific to the integrated smart parking systems. Finally, we present a set of design principles which shows the applicability of our proposed blockchain-based integrated parking system.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB It is difficult to overstate how large a role Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology has played in advancing safety, mobility, and productivity in our daily lives. ITS encompasses a broad range of technologies, including information and communication technologies, transportation and communication infrastructures, connected vehicles, and emerging technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). It has been studied extensively in many different disciplines, including transportation, communication, database and management communities. Unfortunately, there are still many unsolved challenges that hinder the large deployment of advanced ITS systems. Recent studies have proposed using Blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in ITS such as security and scalability. However, these studies did not address a key question: how can we achieve a sustainable ITS ecosystem? This paper presents our preliminary study where we first point out the limitations of prior Blockchain-based ITS systems and then outline an architecture to support a sustainable ITS ecosystem. Our main goal is to stimulate further effort and cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing guidance and reference for future studies.

DE Blockchain; E-marketplace; smart contract
AB We developed a blockchain-based E-marketplace. A decentralized E-marketplace platform utilizing the blockchain technology is implemented. We use the self-enforcement of smart contracts to secure the deposit and process the payment. Each transaction is verified through the blockchain and is recorded to the decentralized ledger. This enables trustless transactions since the smart contract is self-executed. The smart contract is able to perform credible transactions without trusted third parties, and the transactions on the blockchain are trackable and irreversible. Therefore, both the buyer and the seller cannot breach the contract. All processes are recorded on the blockchain including the product launch, purchase, delivery, and payment. It is trackable and could be submitted to courts as electronic evidence to solve the transaction disputes.

AB Due to emerging disruptive technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) play a vital role for smart living domains, for examples, elderly and disabilities healthcare services and home safety and security monitoring and automation control services. These systems will send automatically an emergency call with home user information and location as a privacy data to public services like hospitals, police offices, or fire departments. This paper introduces emergency service for a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum blockchain with smart contract for decentralized handling access control among untrusted public services so called Home Service Providers (HSPs) and smart home IoT devices. Our SHS testbed consists of (1) smart home sensor manger equipped with Raspberry Pi (RPi) represented as an edge IoT gateway for gathering environmental sensor data, (2) HSP miners deployed Meteor and Ethereum platform, and (3) web-based applications for home users and HSP staffs. Furthermore, our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be presented and analysed.

AB Authentication is essential for sharing information in IoT and its secondary use with AI-capable machines. The aim is to support humans in optimizing risk of supply chains for industrial manufacturing and service provisioning in a timely manner. The ultimate aim is sustainability. The problem for deciding on authentication is probably imperfect information on compliance. Its asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts for secure information sharing may cause vulnerability of data breach and misuse. A traditional way to avoid harm of that asymmetry requires authentic and consistent sharing of audit information on violation of a certification policy to a centralized audit intelligence. This information sharing is, however, subject to the problem of single point of failure of the centralized audit intelligence.With our work on Security by Design, we show a non-central approach of clarifying accountability to reduce the risk caused by asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts on authentication. Our signaling and screening scheme SK4SC provides personal digital evidences on compliance to multilateral policies on using information or in other words on trustworthiness. Blockchains are used to realize their symmetric distribution while users share risk on accountability with competition on incentives in a privacy-enhancing manner. Customer relationship management with royalty points, e.g., for eGovernment with taxation, is an example for using SK4SC as digital platform.

AB In this paper, we analyze the suitability of the methods available today for securely managing the wide variety of data produced by the manufacturing sector. We propose a hybrid information architecture for manufacturing, based on decentralized blockchains, cloud-based WORM storage and ordinary cloud storage. We point out shortcomings in the technology available today for realizing this architecture. In particular, we identify a need for low-cost IoT-based systems to capture, identify, preprocess, encrypt and transmit factory floor data to the corresponding data storage subsystems. We describe our proof-of-concept implementation of such an IoT system, along with the factory case study that inspired it, and argue that this system is sufficiently inexpensive to be retrofitted into today's factories.

AB This work demonstrates how a multi-company shareholder rights management system has been implemented using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In this demo(1), we use a permissioned blockchain to store our corporate data, such as the list of all registered companies, each company's shareholders and how many shares everyone holds. It is assumed that the nodes of the blockchain are controlled by the main stakeholder agents but we show that users who do not run a node can still use multiple websites to access company information. On top of this, we show our system can be used to allow any shareholder to participate in elections for company matters. Lastly, we describe how we designed our system's architecture so that it could be implemented even on a public blockchain.

ID BITCOIN
AB The blockchain is the core mechanism of Bitcoin, which is mainly enabled by a distributed consensus mechanism. Essentially, in Proof-of-Work-based consensus protocol, the miners generate a series of blocks to realize decentralization practical. Miners receive two types of revenue: block rewards and transaction fees, in which the reward of block drops off as time goes on. Carlsten et al. defined a mining gap and then Tsabary et al. analyzed the gap game exploring how mining gaps form. In this paper, we analyze the other implications of the gap game. First, it is well known that the security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus protocol relies on miners behaving correctly. The security of the blockchain system will be threatened in case of the consensus mechanism is breached. Therefore, we also described how the gap game impacts the decentralization of Bitcoin and the stability of blockchain. Second, to confirm the implication, we discuss what aspects of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game; then we defined a new decentralization model and listed its main features. In the end, we analyze the block reward capacity in the blockchain and consider the impact on the existing two common block reward systems when the gap game was formed.

AB Recently, blockchain has been a disruptive technology for many systems, such as fmance, e-health, supply-chain, and etc. Secure access to blockchain is the grand challenge for many systems. Key management is one of challenges to ensure secure access to blockchain. In this paper, we propose a framework for secure accessing to blockchain via multi-factor authentication. We combine both biometric and password authentications to secure private keys of users. The framework contains a secure device which has a biometric sensor to ensure secure access to private keys that extends the usability for secure accessing to blockchain.

AB Robotic events can provide notable amounts of information regarding a robot's status, which can be extrapolated to detect productivity, anomalies, malfunctions and used for monitorization. However, when problems occur in sensitive environments like a factory, the logs of a machine may be discarded because they are susceptible to chances and malicious intents. In this paper we propose to use RobotChain for anomaly detection. RobotChain is a method to securely register robotic events, using a blockchain, which ensures that once an event gets registered on it, it's secured and cannot be tampered with. We show how this system can be leveraged with the module for anomaly detection, that uses the information contained on the blockchain to detect anomalies on a UR3 robot.

AB The need for sensors to deliver, communicate, collect, alert, and share information in various applications has made wireless sensor networks very popular. However, due to its limited resources in terms of computation power, battery life and memory storage of the sensor nodes, it is challenging to add security features to provide the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Blockchain technology ensures security and avoids the need of any trusted third party. However, applying Blockchain in a resource-constrained wireless sensor network is a challenging task because Blockchain is power, computation, and memory hungry in nature and demands heavy bandwidth due to control overheads. In this paper, a new routing and a private communication Blockchain framework is designed and tested with Constant Bit rate (CBR). The proposed Load Balancing Multi-Hop (LBMH) routing shares and enhances the battery life of the Cluster Heads and reduce control overhead during Block updates, but due to limited storage and energy of the sensor nodes, Blockchain in sensor networks may never become a reality unless computation, storage and battery life are readily available at low cost.

AB Personal health records (PHRs) are private and vital assets for every patient. There have been introduced many works on various aspects of managing and organizing the PHR so far. However, there is an uncertain remaining issue for the role of PHR in emergencies. In a traditional emergency access system, the patient cannot give consent to emergency staff for accessing his/her PHR. Moreover, there is no secured record management of patient's PHR, which reveals highly confidential personal information, such as what happened, when, and who has access to such information. This paper proposes an emergency access control management system (EACMS) based on permissioned blockchain hyperledger fabric and hyperledger composer. In the proposed system, we defined some rules using the smart contracts for emergency condition and time duration for the emergency access PHR data items that patient can assign some limitations for controlling the PHR permissions. We analyzed the performance of our proposed framework by implementing it through the hyperledger composer based on the response time, privacy, security, and accessibility. The experiments con firm that our framework provides better efficiency compared with the traditional emergency access system.

AB The protection of smart meters (SMs) from cyberattacks is of utmost importance because SMs in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) are physically unprotected and produce a large amount of sensitive data. Due to scalability, the SMs are small-sized and low-cost devices having low computational capabilities. The algorithms that are designed to complete the security requirements of SMs should be lightweight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight security solution to address the manin-the-middle attack, data tempering, and blockchain-based data provenance. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is used to generate link fingerprints, which are used along with pseudo-random nonce to secure AMI. The proposed algorithm detects the involvement of adversarial node or meter tempering by computing other values along with 0 and 1 as the average of consecutive RSSI and difference between the RSSI of connected static SMs. Pearson correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.9102 is achieved when no adversarial node is present in between the connected SMs having mobility in one or both SMs. Negative or approximately equal to zero values of rho are computed when the adversary is present in the AMI or any of the SM in the AMI is forged. For blockchain-based data provenance, all the hash values of the packet header are 100% matched with the hash functions present at the data concentrator unit (DCU), which shows no adversary's involvement in AMI. For cases when the adversary is in the AMI, hash functions show no match with the hash values present at the DCU.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is pervasive to support high-speed end-to-end data transmission and computation for 5th generation (5G) mobile communications by offloading computation tasks to the cloud at the edge of a cellular base station. In a cellular network for healthcare applications, we must consider the different priorities of data transmission and computation by referring to the emergency levels of patients. A critical issue of determining the allocation of wireless resources among users is the authenticity of their priorities (i.e., emergency levels). Without authenticating the users' priorities, a user who advocates a higher emergency level can allocate more wireless resources, leading to the insufficient wireless resources to the users who are actually in high priorities. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of end-to-end delay of wireless users in a cellular network with the authenticity of their priorities by blockchain consensus and propose an algorithm of allocating communication and computation resources to minimize the delay of data transmission and computation. The numerical results illustrate that our proposed algorithm is capable of dramatically reducing the end-to-end delay under the various scenarios of healthcare applications.

AB While blockchains and more generally distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are passing over their hype curve peak, their shortcomings are becoming more apparent. One relatively recent approach to address their performance, scalability, privacy, and other problems are to use multiple different DLTs instead of relying on just one. While there are no really established standards for combining several DLTs, a few repeating patterns can be observed. In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the "one chain rules them all" model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation. The interledger approaches discussed in this survey include 1) atomic cross-chain transactions, 2) transactions across a network of payment channels, 3) the W3C Interledger Protocol (ILP), 4) bridging, 5) sidechains, and 6) ledger-of-ledgers. The approaches are compared according to whether they support the transfer or the exchange of value, their interconnection trust mechanism, complexity, scalability, and transaction cost.

TI Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Opportunities and Limits of a New
   Monetary Regime
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE cryptocurrencies; blockchain; money; trust; institutionalism
AB Cryptocurrency innovations such as Bitcoin raise the question of the possible transformation of the monetary regime and how it would operate. The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is said to be "trustless" because it has been designed to avoid a "trusted third party." Drawing on the institutionalist approach of Aglietta and Orlean emphasizing the importance of trust in money and the monetary system, we show that Bitcoin is characterized by: (1) methodical trust through the existence of an objective proof of payment; (2) hierarchical trust due to the concentration in the mining process; and (3) ethical trust organized around the rejection of banks and the state, although the early ethical commitment is unstable. In other words, trust is now materialized in a form of technical institution, the blockchain. However, Bitcoin cannot be used as everyday money as it would bring about a deflationist and dysfunctional monetary regime, as well as high transaction costs. Some other cryptocurrencies could lead to interesting transformations of the monetary regime if they were to provide new forms of sovereignty, avoid a design based on a fixed monetary supply, or if central banks decided to back them.

AB In the context of globalization, the problem of creating an integrated ecosystem of national and international supply chains becomes actual. Currently, the organization and supply chain management (SCM) are characterized by the inefficient use of existing assets, lack of flexibility and transparency of operations, complex and dynamic interaction between the chain participants. Blockchain technology provides for the real possibility to ensure the innovation and technological development of SCM. Harmonization of the fundamental principles of the blockchain technology and supply chain management models will provide for a new level of interaction between the industrial, commercial, transport and logistics companies based on global information transparency, mutual trust, transaction security. Owing to immaturity of the technology and lack of enough the successful implemented projects risks of its implementation in SCM system considerably increase. Generating a balanced strategy for the integration of the blockchain technology in supply chain management is a promising area of research. This process assumes forming and the analysis of the possible strategic alternatives considering the synthetic nature of the concept of SCM, diversity of use of blockchain technology, uncertainty and risks. Development of alternative strategies is a result of the implementation of a systematic approach to carrying out comprehensive studies of external and internal factors, the relationships between them, in the assessment of opportunities and potential threats.

AB The purpose of this study is to systematize the socio-technological drivers of the smart city development based on the author's concept of econotronics. The following theoretical and practical results are obtained. The specificity of the smart city is shown and the main socio-technological drivers of its development are presented. These drivers include big data processing, cloud technologies, blockchain, digital platforms, the Internet of things and the fractional economy. The author's conception of econotronics is presented as a concept of economic analysis of a digital society. Econotronics is an economy section on the institutions of interaction between economic agents and society through digital technologies dynamics development. Socio-technological drivers of smart city development are systematized by levels of econotronics modeling. The design of institutions corresponds to the application of big data technology, the distribution of institutions-to the use of cloud technologies, the measurement of institutions-to the use of blockchain technologies, and the evolution of institutions-to the use of digital platforms, the Internet of things and the sharing economy. The principles and ideas of institutional modeling of a smart city econotronics are presented. It is shown that different levels of modeling of economic institutions correspond to the application of socio-technological drivers of the smart city development. It is concluded that the principles and ideas of econotronics can be used to model the smart city institutional formation.

AB One of the important possible directions of block-chain technology implementation is the sphere of housing and communal services. The use of blockchain in accounting for the received utilities and payment for them can make these processes absolutely transparent, understandable and verifiable, which is not always done with the current system of payment for housing and communal services. The paper describes the algorithms of interaction between suppliers and consumers of housing and communal services on the basis of blockchain technology, hashchain and cryptography methods. Blockchain procedures for concluding a contract for the supply of utilities, accounting for consumption, billing, payment for services and resolving problems have been developed. The proposed methods allow both providers and consumers of ESIA to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the data, as well as their protection and indestructibility.

AB The article discusses the main approaches to the blockchain technology for managing financial flows between enterprises, and between the state and enterprises. The entry of Ukraine into the global information space and the introduction of cryptocurrency in the domestic financial market will expand the investment market and provide targeted budgetary investments to national producers. They, in turn, can increase production through final product, services, net exports or the creation of products that replace imported ones. Three important functions of the blockchain technology-based financial services sector have been proposed: registration of transactions in an enterprise, identity verification (legal address), and contracting. The principles of state policy in the field of financial institutions in the cryptocurrency market are considered. Operations on the cryptocurrency market carried out by their participants at their own risk are described. The article discusses state guarantees for the observance and protection of property and other rights and legal interests of professional participants of the cryptocurrency market and other persons engaged in mining or operations with cryptocurrency, conditions of free competition in the provision of financial services in the cryptocurrency market.

AB Currently, the attention of the world community is directed not only to the global problems of the economy, but also to social and humanitarian issues, the main of which are the problems of: sustainable development, food security, combating hunger, preserving natural resources, etc. World fishing sector plays an important role in addressing these current global issues.
   Issues, related to the use of digital technologies in this field of activity, were reflected in this article. In particular, the examples, being the most relevant in terms of increasing the profitability and sustainability of the sector, examples of the application of digital technologies in international fishing and fish farming are considered.
   These issues directly affect the interests of Russia, connected with the development of the domestic fishing industry, with its qualitative improvement. Digital economy, on the one hand, becomes an important factor contributing to the solution of this problem, but on the other hand, the introduction of its technology is facing serious challenges, which is also reflected in the article.

AB The article contains an analysis of the innovations of Russian civil law that come into force on October 1, 2019 and the regulatory institution of digital rights.
   Understanding the meaning, content and legal basis of a smart contract is the most important condition for implementing the national strategy for digitization of the Russian economy.
   Analysis of theoretical views on the nature and prospects of the application of smart contracts, set out in the article, takes into account the main aspects of the development of the information society in the Russian Federation, taking into account the peculiarities of the modern economic and legal development of our country.
   The authors emphasize the importance of understanding that the success of the implementation of legislative initiatives can be guaranteed if they meet not only the economic interest of the state, but also all subjects of economic relations.
   The article concludes that it is necessary to study Western experience in securing basic digital rights and unifying the existing legal framework in order to increase the effectiveness of government regulation of digital legal relations.

DE copyright; related rights; plagiarism; blockchain technology
AB In the contemporary world the issues of copyright and related rights protection have become indeed pressing. Copyright and related rights objects quite often cost a lot and it means their usage allows their owners to get a large profit. So an owner is highly motivated to establish a maximally full control over a legal fate of these immaterial benefits. Achievement of such control is exercised, on the one hand, by demands to observe the right of authorship regarding the object created, and on the other hand, due to the prohibition against its unauthorized use that valid for all third parties. Changing the cyberspace parameters that resulted in appearing of a new digital form of intellectual product, application of new digital ways of using copyright and related rights objects, domination of computer networks in the dissemination of intellectual products have considerably weakened and sometimes brought to nought an owner's control over the use of a creative result. In the opinion of a great number of researchers the discussed problems may be successfully solved by means of blockchain technology. The Russian Federation has already started to apply blockchain technology in the sphere of intellectual property. This article is intended for discussing the blockchain technology platforms being used for copyright and related rights protection.

AB There are many blockchain frameworks have been introduced to user, developer, and customer and they have to make a decision which one is most suitable for them in order for developing their applications. This paper describes an empirical research to benchmark the properties of frameworks in Hyperledger family. The purpose is to show the advantage & disadvantage of each framework. We apply the deeply study inside the framework and do the experiment to measure the properties as well as give literature and numerical review of each framework. Our results show the status of tested frameworks and do not demonstrate how to employ the framework as well as apply to the detail application. The main contribution of this paper is a statistical analysis of the effectiveness of Hyperledger frameworks as a tool for developer to develop their applications.

AB With the continuous development and wide application of blockchain technology, the problem of privacy leakage is becoming more and more prominent and must be fully taken seriously. This paper proposes a new blockchain signature scheme based on the aggregation signature scheme for the privacy protection of transaction addresses in blockchain. Compared with related schemes, the privacy protection scheme reduces the computational overhead of the signature and verification process, reduces the storage overhead of the blockchain, and improves the communication efficiency. The theoretical analysis results show that the scheme is safe and effective, and can protect the identity privacy of the receiver in the blockchain transaction.

AB Two-factor authentication (2FA) is widely prevalent in banking, emails and virtual private networks (VPN) connections or in accessing any secure web service. In 2FA, to get authenticated the users are expected to provide additional secret information along with the password. Typically, this secret information (tokens) is generated by a centralized trusted third party upon receiving an authentication request from users. Thus, this additional layer of security comes at the cost of inherently trusting the third party for their services. The security of such authentication systems is always under the threat of the trusted party is being compromised. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to make server authentication even more secure by building 2FA over the blockchain platform which is distributed in nature. The proposed solution does not require any trusted third party between claimant (user) and the verifier (server) for the authentication purpose. To demonstrate the idea of using blockchain technology for 2FA, we have added an extra layer of security component to the OpenSSH server a widely used application for Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

AB Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are seen as data bases of the future, which reduce the cost of trust and revolutionize transactions between individuals, companies and governments. They are considered as one of the main drivers of future applications, especially in field of Machine to Machine (M2) communications which are one of the basic technologies for Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, Distributed Ledger Technologies with their inherent property to provide security, privacy and decentralized operation are engine for todays and future reliable, autonomous and trusted IoT platforms. For this reason, IoT using DLT can be considered as "Internet of Trusted Things". This paper considers tree basic DLT technologies according to their architecture: blockchain, tangle and hashgraph. Their characteristics are compared considering number of criteria, with the aim to find a proper architecture for a specific M2M application.

AB In this paper, we propose a video surveillance system based on blockchain system. The proposed system consists of a blockchain network with trusted internal managers. The metadata of the video is recorded on the distributed ledger of the blockchain, thereby blocking the possibility of forgery of the data. The proposed architecture encrypts and stores the video, creates a license within the blockchain, and exports the video. Since the decryption key for the video is managed by the private DB of the blockchain, it is not leaked by the internal manager unauthorizedly. In addition, the internal administrator can manage and export videos safely by exporting the license generated in the blockchain to the DRM-applied video player.

AB As part of this study, Blockchain is considered as an integrated-distributed technology and a digital platform for transformation and development of e-government structures. There is conducted critical assessment of Blockchain technological characteristics and also, there are considered the consequences of its implementation into government organizations and their processes. At the same time, from the interdisciplinary point of view, it is regarded to transfer from a technology-oriented approach to a need-soriented approach, which is adapted to Blockchain applications, ensuring and keeping the requirements for administrative and managerial processes. Based on the assessment, the authors' substance the approach to investing the potential benefits of using Blockchain for e-government structures, as well as managing the architecture and applications of Blockchain in accordance with social needs and social values within the changing institutional paradigm conditioned upon the transition to a digital economy. On the one hand, the prospect of Blockchain technology management, in which government agencies use Blockchain technology for their own processes, such as the provision of public and municipal services, where Blockchain technology is used to manage transactions. Another perspective is called Blockchain technology management, which defines how the Blockchain should look like, how to adapt to changes and ensure the ability to implement the goals and objectives of public authorities, as well as the social needs of the population.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world in an evergrowing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies, blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the level of security in IoT are discussed.

ID SHARING ECONOMY
AB Peer-to-peer energy trading and next generation local energy market mechanisms are expected to provide new use cases and opportunities within the future sharing economy landscape. To this anticipation, we propose alternative incentive mechanisms as energy policy instruments that can be used by policy makers for directly supporting local energy producers, and hence indirectly the consumers, at current local energy markets using capabilities provided by contemporary distributed ledger technology. Under such peer-to-peer local market setting, we first detail market pricing and relevant market parameters thoroughly, and then we discuss fair incentive distribution to local producers in detail, by means of two distinct incentive systems what we call as the fixed stipend and the decaying stipend incentive mechanisms, respectively. We provide an analysis of market pricing and market parameters under German power market conditions, and an illustration of proposed support instruments with resorting to three scenarios experimented on a local energy market test bed that is equipped with realistic energy generation and consumption profiles for its participants.

TI Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanisms for Future Blockchain Networks:
   Fundamentals, Applications and Opportunities
SO IEEE ACCESS

   proof-of-work; security; and mining process
AB The rapid development of blockchain technology and their numerous emerging applications has received huge attention in recent years. The distributed consensus mechanism is the backbone of a blockchain network. It plays a key role in ensuring the network's security, integrity, and performance. Most current blockchain networks have been deploying the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, in which the consensus is reached through intensive mining processes. However, this mechanism has several limitations, e.g., energy inefficiency, delay, and vulnerable to security threats. To overcome these problems, a new consensus mechanism has been developed recently, namely proof of stake, which enables to achieve the consensus via proving the stake ownership. This mechanism is expected to become a cutting-edge technology for future blockchain networks. This paper is dedicated to investigating proof-of-stake mechanisms, from fundamental knowledge to advanced proof-of-stake-based protocols along with performance analysis, e.g., energy consumption, delay, and security, as well as their promising applications, particularly in the field of Internet of Vehicles. The formation of stake pools and their effects on the network stake distribution are also analyzed and simulated. The results show that the ratio between the block reward and the total network stake has a significant impact on the decentralization of the network. Technical challenges and potential solutions are also discussed.

AB Modern power systems face different challenges such as the ever-increasing electrical energy demand, the massive growth of renewable energy with distributed generations, the large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices adaptation, the emerging cyber-physical security threats, and the main goal of maintaining the system's stability and reliability. These challenges pose extreme pressure on finding advanced technologies and sustainable solutions for secure and reliable operations of the power system. The blockchain is one of the recent technologies that have gained lots of attention in different applications including smart grid for its uniqueness and decentralized nature. In the last few years, this technology grew a momentum specifically with the cryptocurrencies' industry such as the Bitcoin and Etherium. The Blockchain's applications in the smart grids could offer many innovative and affordable solutions to some of the challenges that the future and the current smart grids will be facing. This paper reviews different prospects, advantages, approaches, and technical challenges of utilizing the blockchain technology in the smart grid, and presents frameworks for key smart grid blockchain-based applications; more specifically, it is shown that how the blockchain can be used as the smart grid's cyber-physical layer.

AB Project based learning is the methodology in which projects drive knowledge and is used in dedicated subjects without negotiating the coverage of the required technical material. This paper discusses the scheme and delivery of project based learning in computer science engineering as major project which adopts undergraduate creativities and emphasizes on real-world, open-ended projects. These projects foster a wide range of abilities, not only those related to content knowledge or technical skills, but also practical skills. The goal for this innovative undergrad project is to show how a trained machine model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency if we give the right amount of data and computational power. It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data. Furthermore, with the rise of the crypto digital era more heads have turned towards the digital market for investments. This gives us the opportunity to create a model capable of predicting crypto currencies primarily Bitcoin. This can be accomplished by using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies.

DE Cryptocurrency Wallet; Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
AB Many cryptocurrency wallet applications on desktop provide an open remote procedure call (RPC) interface that other blockchain-based applications can use to access their functionality. This paper studies the security of the RPC interface in several cryptocurrency wallets. We find that, in many cases, a malicious process running on the computer regardless of its privileges can impersonate the communication endpoints of the RPC channel and, effectively, steal the funds in the wallet. The attacks are closely related to server and client impersonation on computer networks but occur inside the computer. The malicious process may be created by another authenticated but unprivileged user on the same computer or even by the guest user. The main contribution of this paper is to raise awareness among wallet developers about the need to protect local RPC channels with the same prudence as network connections. We also hope that it will discourage users to run security-critical applications like cryptocurrency wallets on shared systems or computers with guest account enabled.

AB Cryptocurrencies have provided a promising infrastructure for pseudonymous online payments. However, low throughput has significantly hindered the scalability and usability of cryptocurrency systems for increasing numbers of users and transactions. Another obstacle to achieving scalability is the requirement for every node to duplicate the communication, storage, and state representation of the entire network.
   In this paper, we introduce the Asynchronous Consensus Zones, which scales blockchain system linearly without compromising decentralization or security. We achieve this by running multiple independent and parallel instances of single- chain consensus systems termed as zones. The consensus happens independently within each zone with minimized communication, which partitions the workload of the entire network and ensures a moderate burden for each individual node as the network grows. We propose eventual atomicity to ensure transaction atomicity across zones, which achieves the efficient completion of transactions without the overhead of a two- phase commit protocol. Additionally, we propose Chu- ko- nu mining to ensure the effective mining power in each zone to be at the same level of the entire network, making an attack on any individual zone as hard as that on the full network. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our work: on a testbed including 1,200 virtual machines worldwide to support 48,000 nodes, our system delivers 1,000 x throughput and 2,000 x capacity over the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

AB In the digital healthcare era, it is utmost important to harness medical information scattered across healthcare institutions to support in-depth data analysis. However, the boundaries of cyberinfrastructure of healthcare providers place obstacles on data sharing. In this position paper, we firstly identify the challenges of medical data sharing and management. Then we introduce the background and give a brief survey on the state-of-the-art. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing a few possible research directions to cope with the challenges in current medical information sharing.

AB Falls are one of the major health concerns for the elderly people. These falls often result in severe injuries which lead into huge medical expenses. Over the recent years, many ICT based fall detection and fall prevention solutions emerged to address the risk factors associated with falls. However, despite of these research studies, predicting the likelihood of falls still remains as a huge challenge in both medical and IT research domains. Data related to these risk factors being scattered among different healthcare providers can be attributed as a main reason for this challenge. This is further amplified by healthcare providers being reluctant to disseminate the data beyond their entities due to the security and privacy concerns. However, in recent years, blockchain has been proven as a promising technology to address the security and privacy challenges in healthcare data exchange as it provides a shared, immutable, and transparent audit trail for accessing data. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to propose a conceptual blockchain based fall prediction model leveraging smart contracts and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to identify the elderly people who are at a higher risk of falling.

AB The EPCglobal Network is a computer network used to share product data between trading partners. The EPC Information Services (EPCIS) is an event record repository that allows disparate applications to access and query for data both within and across enterprises. Ultimately, this data sharing is aimed at enabling participants in the EPCglobal Network to gain a shared view of the disposition of EPC-bearing objects within a relevant business context [1].
   Despite the potential benefits, enterprises are reluctant to integrate into the EPCglobal Network due to the financial and manpower resources required to set up, operate and maintain the EPCIS and to adopt the standards. Issues like security, computation and storage overheads would also have to be managed. To solve the problem, this paper advocates a blockchain solution using Hyperledger Fabric to serve as a shared EPCIS across trading partners. The blockchain can be queried directly to facilitate information sharing subjected to access control rules. It also adheres to the EPCglobal Network standards. This approach provides several important benefits including eliminating the need for enterprises to maintain their own EPCIS while still being able to participate and benefit from the network. As the blockchain can be queried directly, the provision of EPC Discovery Services (EPCDS) may also be unnecessary. To explore this idea, we constructed a prototype using Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric while adhering to the data elements, structures and formats as stated in the standards to ensure interoperability with existing architecture both upstream and downstream.

AB Blockchain-based applications usually consist of centralized elements (e.g., web servers and back-end logic) connected to decentralized elements such as smart contracts. The engineering of such hybrid software architectures poses a challenge as it is unclear which elements should be centralized or decentralized. Furthermore the impact of this decision (or the balance between those two areas) on software quality attributes such as security, maintainability, performance or costs is currently unknown. The goal is to build a software architecture using the benefits and handling the challenges of blockchain technology while fulfilling the relevant quality attributes. While there are several approaches examining the relation between architectural decisions and quality attributes in centralized systems, research is at an early stage for decentralized elements in software architectures. This paper presents a first step towards architectural blockchain tactics. With a simplified experiment comparing two implementation variants of an Ethereum smart contract we show that software design patterns are not always beneficial and that the expected usage scenarios have a strong impact on the operational costs. We argue that further research and validation is necessary for gaining more qualitative and quantitative insights to make informed architectural design decisions when using blockchain technology and give a first outline on how to achieve this.

AB The article deals with the problem of knowledge erosion as the result of data and information explosive growth. The conception of knowledge and knowledge core as a system of established and accepted scientific ("textbook") knowledge necessary to be transferred for sustainable social development is presented. The way of protecting knowledge core from destruction and unauthorized change is proposed with the use of Unified Electronic Educational Environment (UEEE) based on a set of learning objects constituting the Unified Bank of Learning Objects. Permitted blockchain algorithm as a basic means of protecting Unified Bank of Learning Objects is considered.

AB This paper reports on a co-speculative interview study with charitable donors to explore the future of programmable, conditional and data-driven donations. Responding to the rapid emergence of blockchain-based and AI-supported financial technologies, we specifically examine the potential of automated, third-party 'escrows', where donations are held before they are released or returned based on specified rules and conditions. To explore this we conducted pilot workshops with 9 participants and an interview study in which 14 further participants were asked about their experiences of donating money, and invited to co-speculate on a service for programmable giving. The study elicited how data-driven conditionality and automation could be leveraged to create novel donor experiences, however also illustrated the inherent tensions and challenges involved in giving programmatically. Reflecting on these findings, our paper contributes implications both for the design of programmable aid platforms, and the design of escrow-based financial services in general.

AB In this paper we unpack empirical data from two domains within the Blockchain information infrastructure: The cryptocurrency trading domain, and the energy domain. Through these accounts we introduce the relational concepts of Blockchain Assemblages and Whiteboxing. Blockchain assemblages comprise configurations of digital and analogue artefacts that are entangled with imaginaries about the current and future state of the Blockchain information infrastructure. Rather than being a black box, Blockchain assemblages alternate between being dynamic and stable entities. We propose Whiteboxing as the sociomaterial process which drives blockchain assemblages in their dynamic state to be (re)configured, while related artefacts and imaginaries are simultaneously transformed, creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing historical accounts demonstrating technologies in the making, the contribution of this paper, proposes whiteboxing as an analytical concept which allows us to unpack how contemporary technologies are created through entrepreneurial activities.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Bitcoin blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of nodes authorizing transactions between anonymous parties. Its key actors are miners using computational power to solve mathematical problems for validating transactions. By sharing blockchain's characteristics, mining is a decentralized, transparent and unregulated practice, less explored in HCI, so we know little about miners' motivations and experiences, and how these may impact on different dimensions of trust. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin miners about their practices and trust challenges. Findings contribute to HCI theories by extending the exploration of blockchain's characteristics relevant to trust with the competitiveness dimension underpinning the social organization of mining. We discuss the risks of collaborative mining due to centralization and dishonest administrators, and conclude with design implications highlighting the need for tools monitoring the distribution of rewards in collaborative mining, tools tracking data centers' authorization and reputation, and tools supporting the development of decentralized pools.

AB Technologies such as blockchains, smart contracts and programmable batteries facilitate emerging models of energy distribution, trade and consumption, and generate a considerable number of opportunities for energy markets. However, these developments complicate relationships between stakeholders, disrupting traditional notions of value, control and ownership. Discussing these issues with the public is particularly challenging as energy consumption habits often obscure the competing values and interests that shape stakeholders' relationships. To make such difficult discussions more approachable and examine the missing relational aspect of autonomous energy systems, we combined the design of speculative hairdryers with performance and deliberation. This integrated method of inquiry makes visible the competing values and interests, eliciting people's wishes to negotiate these terms. We argue that the complexity of mediated energy distribution and its convoluted stakeholder relationships requires more sophisticated methods of inquiry to engage people in debates concerning distributed energy systems.

AB The product conceptualisation, design and manufacturing phases are becoming increasingly complex, since more available resources, stakeholders and sophisticated technologies are involved during product development. The exchange and management of product-related information is often a challenging task, affecting significantly the intellectual property protection process as well as the distinction of roles among stakeholders. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that utilises blockchain technology principles for managing product development information and processes with the goal of providing new approaches to extending the functionality of product data management systems. A test case focusing on products developed with additive manufacturing technologies is presented. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CIRP.

AB This paper is a progress report on our recent work on two applications that use Linked Data and Distributed Ledger technologies and aim to transform the Greek public sector into a decentralized, trusted, intelligent and linked organization. The first application is a re-engineering of Diavgeia, the Greek government portal for open and transparent public administration. The second application is Nomothesia, a new portal that we have built, which makes Greek legislation available on the Web as linked data to enable its effective use by citizens, legal professionals and software developers who would like to build new applications that utilize Greek legislation. The presented applications have been implemented without funding from any source and are available for free to any part of the Greek public sector that may want to use them. An important goal of this paper is to present the lessons learned from this effort.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has integrated the sensor network silos to the Internet and enabled the provision of value-added services across these networks. These smart devices are now becoming socially conscious by following the social Internet of Things (SIoT) model that empowers them to create and maintain social relationships among them. The Social Internet of Vehicle (SIoV) is one application of SIoT in the vehicular domain that has evolved the existing intelligent transport system (ITS) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to the next phase of Intelligent by adding socializing aspect and constant connectivity. SIoV generates a massive amount of real-time data enriched with context and social relationship information about vehicles, drivers, passengers, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, the role of privacy management becomes essential in SIoV, as data is collected and stored at different layers of its architecture. The challenge of privacy is aggravated because the dynamic nature of SIoV poses a major threat in its adoption. Motivated by the need to address these aspects, this paper identifies the challenges involved in managing privacy in SIoV. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the privacy issues and factors that are essential to be considered for preserving privacy in SIoV environments from different perspectives including the privacy of a person, behavior and action, communication, data and image, thoughts and feelings, location and space, and association. In addition, the paper discusses the blockchain-based solutions to preserve privacy for SIoV.

AB Research into the established area of the intelligent transportation system is evolving into the Internet of Vehicles, a fast-moving research area, fuelled in part by rapid changes based on cyber-physical systems. It needs to be recognized that existing vehicular communication systems are susceptible to privacy vulnerabilities which require addressing. Apractical challenge is that many vehicular communication applications and services make use of basic safety messages that contain the identity of the vehicle, location, and other personal data. A popular way of dealing with this privacy issue is to utilize a pseudonym change scheme to protect the vehicle's identity and location. However, many such schemes suffer that the cost grows and the certificate management difficulty raises with the number of pseudonyms generated and stored, casting doubt of the economic feasibility of that approach. We propose a decentralized blockchain-based solution for pseudonym management that overcomes these limitations. This scheme consists of pseudonym distribution and a shuffle operation, allowing the reuse of existing pseudonyms to different vehicles. The results reported here, including those from our simulations, demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reuse existing pseudonyms and achieve a better degree of anonymity at a lower cost than existing schemes.

DE Data assets; big data trading platform; regulatory construction
AB As a new type of asset, the value of big data resources can only be realized in the transaction circulation. Establishing and improving the big data trading platform market system is a systematic project to transform data from resources into assets. Through the comparative analysis of several typical big data trading platform construction practices in China, this research finds some problems, such as unclear positioning of some platforms leading to overlapping functions, extensive data transaction, lack of unified data pricing methods, unclear data ownership. In addition, there is no difference between the data escrow transaction mode and the aggregate transaction mode, and the rights of the data supply parties cannot be guaranteed. And it also discusses how to promote the construction and improvement of China's big data trading market more systematically, normally and institutionally. Finally, it proposes to build local big data trading platforms according to local conditions, establish a data transaction system based on blockchain, establish a big data transaction pricing index system, and establish a big data standard system.

AB The present paper deals with the problem of comprehension within the framework of digital communication. The digital communications functioning within the framework of the post-information society are characterized by interactivity, unlimited capacity, the exchange of communicants' roles and only a conditional possibility for determining directions, values and possible consequences of communication.
   The authors come to a conclusion that new technologies (blockchain, AI, Big data) contribute to implementation of efficient communicative strategies, in which each communicant takes into account the social and personal characteristics of communication participants. The choice of discursive strategies should be based on the possibility of forming multiple identities of all communication participants. But achieving full understanding between the communication participants is difficult due to the impossibility of merging the communicating " Ego" and " the Other".

AB Metering is a critical process in large-scale distributed industrial plants, which enables multiple plants to collaborate to offer mutual services without outside interference. When distributed plants measure the data from a shared common source, e. g., flow metering in an oil pipeline, trustworthiness and immutability must be guaranteed among them. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based secure metering system, SMChain, to provide strong security, trustworthy guarantee, and immutable services. SMChain adopts a two-layer blockchain structure, consisting of independent local blockchains stored at individual plants and one state blockchain stored in the cloud. To deal with the scalability issues within each plant, we propose a novel scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol based on (k, n)-threshold signature scheme to deal with the Byzantine faults and reduce the intra-plant communication complexity from O(n(2)) to O(n). For the state blockchain, we use a cloud-based service to synchronize and integrate the local blockchains into one state blockchain, which can further be distributed back to each plant.

DE Ledger; cryptocurrency; information dissemination
AB Distributed ledgers have received significant attention as a building block for cryptocurrencies and have proven to be also relevant in several other fields. In cryptocurrencies, this abstraction is usually implemented by grouping transactions in blocks that are then linked together to form a blockchain. Nodes need to exchange information to maintain the status of the chain but this process consumes significant network resources. Unfortunately, naively reducing the number of messages exchanged can have a negative impact in performance and correctness, as some transactions might not be included in the chain.
   In this paper, we study the mechanisms of information dissemination used in Bitcoin and propose a set of adaptive mechanisms that lower network resource usage. Our experimental evaluation shows that is possible to lower the bandwidth consumed by 10.2% and the number of exchanged messages in 41.5%, without any negative impact in the number of transactions committed.

AB Bitcoin, the most popular blockchain system, does not scale even under very optimistic assumptions. Lightning networks, a layer on top of Bitcoin, composed of one-to-one lightning channels make it scale to up to 105 Million users. Recently, Duplex Micropayment Channel factories have been proposed based on opening multiple one-to-one payment channels at once. Duplex Micropayment Channel factories rely on time-locks to update and close their channels. This mechanism yields to situation where users funds time-locking for long periods increases with the lifetime of the factory and the number of users. This makes DMC factories not applicable in real-life scenarios.
   In this paper, we propose the first channel factory construction, the Lightning Factory that offers a constant collateral cost, independent of the lifetime of the channel and members of the factory. We compare our proposed design with Duplex Micropayment Channel factories, obtaining better performance results by a factor of more than 3000 times in terms of the worst-case constant collateral cost incurred when malicious users use the factory. The message complexity of our factory is n where Duplex Micropayment Channel factories need n(2) messages where n is the number of users. Moreover, our factory copes with an infinite number of updates while in Duplex Micropayment Channel factories the number of updates is bounded by the initial time-lock.
   Finally, we discuss the necessity for our Lightning Factories of BNN, a non-interactive aggregate signature cryptographic scheme, and compare it with Schnorr and ECDSA schemes used in Bitcoin and Duplex Micropayment Channels.

AB Readily available blockchain technologies allow to improve reliability and availability of existing cloud applications.
   This paper presents a blockchain based distributed storage system for permissioned settings. We use a blockchain to form verifiable contracts between clients and storage providers, specifying what should be stored, and when stored data can be deleted.
   Our approach utilizes a lightweight proof-of-storage mechanism to verify availability of stored data. Further, we publish majority proofs on the blockchain, to incentivize storage providers to behave correctly and to identify misbehavior.

   control; Decentralized private data auditing
AB Many applications by design depend on costly trusted third-party auditors. One such example is the industrial application case of federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO), in which different organizations contribute to a complex engineering design effort. Although blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has strong potential in reducing the dependence on such intermediaries, the architectural complexity involved in designing a solution is daunting.
   In this paper, we analyze the architectural variants for decentralized private data sharing while guaranteeing auditability and non-repudiation of data access operations, as well availability of the shared data. The architectural variants analyzed focus on attaining: (i) confidential data exchange, (ii) governing access to the shared data, (iii) providing data access auditability, and (iv) data validation or conflict resolution. We systematically enumerate architectural decisions at the levels of: storage, policy-based file access control, data encryption methods, and auditability mechanisms for private data.
   The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive overview of architectural variants for decentralized control of private encrypted data, and the involved trade-offs in terms of performance, storage overhead, auditable trust and security. These findings are validated in the context of the aforementioned industry case that involves federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).

AB Blockchain technology is increasingly being adopted as a trusted platform to support business functions including trusted and verifiable transactions, tracking, and validation. However, most business use-cases require privacy and confidentiality for data and transactions. As a result, businesses are forced to choose private blockchain solutions and unable to take full advantage of the capabilities, benefits and infrastructure of public blockchain systems. To address this issue, we present an Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) security solution built on a private-over-public (PoP) blockchain approach. The policy based distributed operation of ABE conforms well to the blockchain concept. The cross-chain PoP approach provides the benefits from both public blockchains and private blockchains. Businesses will be able to restrict access, maintain privacy, and improve performance while still being able to leverage the distributed trust of public blockchains. This paper present the ABE-based security framework and protocol for securing data, transactions as well as smart contracts. Security analysis and performance evaluation show the proposed solution to be effective, efficient and practical. It can greatly reduce the cost and complexity for businesses compared to running isolated private blockchain solutions.

AB Traceability is an increasingly important aspect of the supply chain with several highlights throughout the last few decades. Parties, such as consumers and government agencies, have shown an increase in demand for information regarding their products and materials. Although there exist numerous frameworks for traceability solutions, these frameworks fail to address the concerns with regards to privacy-sensitive information, certificate verifiability, and auditability.
   Our contribution is in two-fold: a traceability system decouples and the product-auditable pasta protocol. decouples is the first decentralized, unlinkable and privacy-preserving traceability system for the supply chain, to the best of our knowledge. The system incorporates cryptographic techniques to address the aforementioned concerns. Our second contribution is the pasta protocol, which allows unique tracking keys per product, per actor. The protocol also anonymizes the receiver of a transaction. Our complexity analysis and proof-of-concept implementation results show that decouples is a feasible traceability system for the supply chain.

AB In today's cryptocurrencies, Hashcash proof of work is the most commonly-adopted approach to mining. In Hashcash, when a miner decides to add a block to the chain, she has to solve the difficult computational puzzle of inverting a hash function. While Hashcash has been successfully adopted in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has attracted significant and harsh criticism due to its massive waste of electricity, its carbon footprint and environmental effects, and the inherent lack of usefulness in inverting a hash function. Various other mining protocols have been suggested, including proof of stake, in which a miner's chance of adding the next block is proportional to her current balance. However, such protocols lead to a higher entry cost for new miners who might not still have any stake in the cryptocurrency, and can in the worst case lead to an oligopoly, where the rich have complete control over mining.
   In this paper, we propose Hybrid Mining: a new mining protocol that combines solving real-world useful problems with Hashcash. Our protocol allows new miners to join the network by taking part in Hashcash mining without having to own an initial stake. It also allows nodes of the network to submit hard computational problems whose solutions are of interest in the real world, e.g. protein folding problems. Then, miners can choose to compete in solving these problems, in lieu of Hashcash, for adding a new block. Hence, Hybrid Mining incentivizes miners to solve useful problems, such as hard computational problems arising in biology, in a distributed manner. It also gives researchers in other areas an easy-to-use tool to outsource their hard computations to the blockchain network, which has enormous computational power, by paying a reward to the miner who solves the problem for them. Moreover, our protocol provides strong security guarantees and is at least as resilient to double spending as Bitcoin.

ID SEQUENTIAL AGGREGATE SIGNATURES
AB Smart contracts are applications that are deployed and executed on a blockchain's decentralised infrastructure. Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum. A system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources. In that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately. In this paper, we present the concept of MUlti-Source oraCLE (MUSCLE) for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. We implement five variants of MUSCLE, each using a different signature or aggregate signature scheme and compare their performance with two oracles that are based on TLS-N, which represents the current state of the art. Our results show that the ECDSA-based MUSCLE features the lowest total gas expenditure, while the BGLS-based oracle provides lower transaction and storage costs.

AB Smart contracts are programs that are stored and executed on the Blockchain and can receive, manage and transfer money (cryptocurrency units). Two important problems regarding smart contracts are formal analysis and compiler optimization. Formal analysis is extremely important, because smart contracts hold funds worth billions of dollars and their code is immutable after deployment. Hence, an undetected bug can cause significant financial losses. Compiler optimization is also crucial, because every action of a smart contract has to be executed by every node in the Blockchain network. Therefore, optimizations in compiling smart contracts can lead to significant savings in computation, time and energy.
   Two classical approaches in program analysis and compiler optimization are intraprocedural and interprocedural analysis. In intraprocedural analysis, each function is analyzed separately, while interprocedural analysis considers the entire program. In both cases, the analyses are usually reduced to graph problems over the control flow graph (CFG) of the program. These graph problems are often computationally expensive. Hence, there has been ample research on exploiting structural properties of CFGs for efficient algorithms. One such well-studied property is the treewidth, which is a measure of tree-likeness of graphs. It is known that intraprocedural CFGs of structured programs have treewidth at most 6, whereas the interprocedural treewidth cannot be bounded. This result has been used as a basis for many efficient intraprocedural analyses.
   In this paper, we explore the idea of exploiting the treewidth of smart contracts for formal analysis and compiler optimization. First, similar to classical programs, we show that the intraprocedural treewidth of structured Solidity and Vyper smart contracts is at most 9. Second, for global analysis, we prove that the interprocedural treewidth of structured smart contracts is bounded by 10 and, in sharp contrast with classical programs, treewidth-based algorithms can be easily applied for interprocedural analysis. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments using a tool we implemented for computing treewidth of smart contracts and show that the treewidth is much lower in practice. We use 36,764 real-world Ethereum smart contracts as benchmarks and find that they have an average treewidth of at most 3.35 for the intraprocedural case and 3.65 for the interprocedural case.

AB We propose TickEth, a system that aims at mitigating some of the problems encountered by the ticketing industry. The name TickEth is built by combining the words ticket, its application domain, and Ethereum, the underlying platform we adopted for the development of the prototype.
   Nowadays, ticketing ecosystem is wide and fragmented, and faces several problems. TickEth exploits Ethereum smart contracts to tackle the inability of checking the authenticity of tickets sold online (that can be fake or duplicates of a real ticket), the wild price range of resold tickets in the secondary market, and the unwieldy refund procedures.
   TickEth is an open specification, where different third-party clients can freely interact, and can be instantiated by different vendors as they like. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype, available at: https://github.com/H221/TickEth

DE Distributed manufacturing; blockchain; process traceability
AB This paper introduces a novel Machine Sharing Economy (MSE) approach to support machine owners in sharing idle machine capacities by means of a marketplace. Manufacturing networks and supply chains are thus no longer static and driven by long-term agreements, but rather dynamic and time-bound. In such distributed manufacturing systems, it is important to keep track of the operations that have been performed, including relevant production information such as the actual machines performing a task, tools, and their parameters. We propose a tamper-proof blockchain-based framework to close the feedback cycle by emitting relevant events of the production process and storing process values in the blockchain. This paper describes the overall architecture of the system including a detailed discussion how the feedback cycle for distributed manufacturing systems has been realized using blockchains. In addition, we perform an empirical validation at a real-world digital factory and present our lessons learned.

AB Cryptocurrency is one of the burning issues across the world in the modern era. Literature shows that business analysts always tend to use new technologies and investigate their risks. Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword. This shows the mutual relationship among different cryptocurrencies and public's concerns about cryptocurrencies.

AB In this paper, we identify and proposed an interface mechanism in blockchain for businesses based on user centric approach. The base of user centric approach in business is to increase user or consumer involvement in the business to increase the productivity. As productivity is an important factor in the field of Human Computer Interaction, our approach can increase user input and output, quality and innovation while decreasing costs, errors for business by using smart contact and user centric model defined by businesses. Smart contacts are big hit now a days as blockchain is becoming more mature. But user interaction to these contracts are very limited. Thus, user centric approach is not fully applicable for such scenario. Our scheme encompasses mechanism to involve the user in smart contract creation process with ease. We consider smart health care business and identify the points where smart contract can utilize the HCI.

TI Blockchain-Based Access Control Model to Preserve Privacy for Personal

ID SECURE; EFFICIENT
AB Personal health record system (PHR system) stores health-related information of an individual. PHR system allows the data owner to manage and share his/her data with selected individuals. The originality or tamper resistance feature is crucial for PHR system because of the irreversible consequence of incorrect information. Blockchain technology becomes a potential solution due to its immutability and irreversibility properties. Unfortunately, some technical impediments such as limited storage, privacy concern, consent irrevocability, inefficient performance, and energy consumption exist. This work aims to handle these blockchain drawbacks and propose a blockchain-based PHR model. The proposed model is built using the blockchain technology to support a tamper resistance feature. Proxy reencryption and other cryptographic techniques are employed to preserve privacy. Features of the proposed model include fine-grained and flexible access control, revocability of consent, auditability, and tamper resistance. A detailed security analysis shows that the proposed model is provably secure for privacy and tamper resistance. The performance analysis shows that the proposed model achieves a better overall performance compared with the existing approach in the literature. Thus the proposed model is more suitable for the PHR system usage.

DT Article

AB This paper is divided in two parts. The first part is the story of a failure, where an attempt to generate verifiable Proof-of-Location from WiFi scan results has failed, even when scan results were compared with a small time shift within the same trace. In the second part, this paper proposes to conduct Proof-of-Location transactions in a peer-to-peer fashion. Each peer is assisted by the cloud side which plays the role of both the real-time mediator and public transaction ledger. This paper proposes the Last Man Standing (LMS) procedure which is both a means for ensuring a fair transaction and a natural way to close it. Each transaction results in a coin which can be either shared among transaction participants or owned individually by LMS. Analysis using real mobility traces from various types of urban locations shows that the proposal is valid and will ensure that all the locations within the city will gradually be claimed via the proposed type of transactions while providing independently verifiable proofs for each location. The distant goal of this paper is a next generation Location-Based Service (LBS) which takes the form of a location-based resource economy where each location is a coin compatible with traditional blockchain operations.

AB Blockchain was only used as a foundation of cryptocurrency initially, but today, we can see the rise of this new emerging technology being implemented in many industries. In the future, most technologies around the world are expected to use blockchain as an efficient way to make online transactions. One of the areas that blockchain technologies can be applied is crowdfunding platforms. The most common problem with current crowdfunding scene in Malaysia (and around the world) is that the campaigns are not regulated and some of the crowd-funding campaign turned out to be fraud. Besides, the completion of some projects also was significantly delayed. This project aims to solve these problems by applying Ethereum smart contracts to the crowdfunding site to that the contracts will be fully automatically executed, thus preventing frauds and ensuring that the projects can be delivered within duration given.

AB The emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has attracted a massive response from different stakeholders including industry, academia and research community due to the wide range of applications it provides. IoT enables devices with storage, computation and communication capabilities to connect to the Internet, thus providing various applications such as smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart industry, logistics and smart homes, to name a few. Since, IoT devices generates sensitive information, therefore, security is an important issue in IoT networks. Recently, Blockchain (BC) is proposed as a revolutionary technology which can be integrated within IoT to provide desired level of security and privacy. However, the integration of BC within IoT networks is extremely challenging. The major contribution of this study is three-fold. (1) Firstly, we proposed a tier-based architecture "Blockchain in Internet-of-ThingS (BITS)" which can support BC within IoT networks. (2) Secondly, we highlighted various applications of BC in IoT networks, and (3) Lastly, we provided various challenges and future research directions in the realization of BC in IoT networks.

AB Blockchain technology is a new shift in the Internet world, it has brought about changes in many sectors. Where transactions can be securely accomplished via point-to-point connections in a distributed system without the need for a third-party, with the help of consensus algorithms. In this paper, we will conduct a comprehensive survey on the Blockchain technology with focusing in the popular consensus algorithms, in order to figure out their features, and the factors that affect the performance and security. Also, we will provide a classification of the consensus algorithms and we will perform a comprehensive comparison of studied consensus algorithms. In addition, we will provide a detailed discussion of the consensus algorithms that studied with an analysis of the main factors affecting these algorithms. Finally, we will refer to some recommendations that must be considered and which can contribute to the development of this area.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) supports a wide range of applications including smart cities, traffic congestion, waste management, structural health, security, emergency services, logistics, retails, industrial control, and health care. IoT is mega-technology that can establish connection with anything, anyone, at any time, place, service on a platform and any network. It has a great impact on the whole block chain of businesses, smart objects and devices, systems and services that are enabled by heterogeneous network connectivity and is developed as a smart pervasive framework of smart devices. IoT devices are in use in many fields, they connect to complex devices, interface with hostile environments and are deployed on various uncontrolled platforms, therefore faces many security issues and challenges. Since the IoT offers a potential platform for integrating any type of network and complex system it could encounter vulnerabilities inherent to the individual systems which are available within the integrated network. This research paper is a study of the security issues of the individual systems responsible for IoT interconnection and their impact towards the integrated IoT system.

AB Smart grids are gradually becoming popular, but itself, especially its power distribution grids, faces many security issues, and false data injection is one of the most attack that happens. Blockchain is considered a key technology for protecting IoT due to its decentralization, non-deformable and high scalability. However, the current blockchain technology costs lots of resources storing and producing blocks, it cannot be directly applied to the power distribution grids with a large number of resource-limited nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes historical chain compression, and then modifys the DPOS and applies it to the blockchain, which help reduce the storeage burden and improve the effiiciency of block producing.

DE Checkpointing; Proof-of-stake; Blockchain; Long range attack
AB Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is getting popularity among low power computing devices as compared to high power and energy demanded proof-of work (PoW). Among the security issues of PoS, Long range attack is declared as one of the major issue by many researchers. Long range attack allows the minority stakeholders to become majority stakeholders over a long time span and then they can control the whole blockchain protocol to produce the valid alternative history. Checkpointing is referred as solution to mitigate the impact of the long range attack but still for the newly joined users as well as the users those will stay offline for long period of time, checkpointing mechanism needs to be re-evaluated. In this paper we studied the checkpointing mechanism and proposed a new strategy to implement the checkpointing inside the blockchain technology. The proposed strategy is designed specifically to mitigate the long range attack or stake bleeding attack.

To meet the rising privacy, reliability, and verifiability needs, we propose Gecko, a multi-cloud dispersal scheme where: (a) the key used to encrypt the data file is the secret in a Latin-square-autotopism secret-sharing scheme, (b) data files and encryption keys are dispersed separately to multiple clouds, and (c) a blockchain-based integrity-check protocol is devised to pinpoint faulty data. Gecko enables fast and thorough key renewal: when a portion of the key (the secret) is leaked, we replace all shares of the partially-leaked secret without replacing the secret itself; this immediately resists targeted attack to certain file without re-encrypting the data file itself. Key renewal is further accelerated by the blockchain-based integrity check. We evaluate Gecko theoretically and experimentally against the traditional AONT-RS dispersal scheme, drawing two conclusions: 1) Gecko admits powerful key renewal and identification of damaged data, with a minor transfer overhead; and 2) Gecko performs key renewal three to five times faster than AONT-RS hybrid-slice renewal (the closest thing AONT-RS has to key renewal).

TI A Survey on Security Verification of Blockchain Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; formal method; security verification; smart contract; survey
AB A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties, which is executed by the computer code. The code does the execution without giving either party the ability to back out, so it ensures the trustless execution. The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.

AB Data is the input for various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to mine valuable features, yet data in Internet is scattered everywhere and controlled by different stakeholders who cannot believe in each other, and usage of the data in complex cyberspace is difficult to authorize or to validate. As a result, it is very difficult to enable data sharing in cyberspace for the real big data, as well as a real powerful AI. In this paper, we propose the SecNet, an architecture that can enable secure data storing, computing, and sharing in the large-scale Internet environment, aiming at a more secure cyberspace with real big data and thus enhanced AI with plenty of data source, by integrating three key components: 1) blockchain-based data sharing with ownership guarantee, which enables trusted data sharing in the large-scale environment to form real big data; 2) AI-based secure computing platform to produce more intelligent security rules, which helps to construct a more trusted cyberspace; 3) trusted value-exchange mechanism for purchasing security service, providing a way for participants to gain economic rewards when giving out their data or service, which promotes the data sharing and thus achieves better performance of AI. Moreover, we discuss the typical use scenario of SecNet as well as its potentially alternative way to deploy, as well as analyze its effectiveness from the aspect of network security and economic revenue.

AB In this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study of smart contracts deployed on the ethereum blockchain. The objective of the analysis is to provide empirical results on smart contracts features, smart contract transactions within the blockchain, the role of the development community, and the source code characteristics. We collected a set of more than 10 000 smart contracts source codes and a dataset of meta-data regarding their interaction with the blockchain from etherscan.io . We examined the collected data computing different statistics on naming policies, smart contract ether balance, number of smart contract transactions, functions, and other quantities characterizing the use and purpose of smart contracts. We found that the number of transactions and the balances follow power-law distributions and the software code metrics display, on average, values lower than corresponding metrics in standard software but have high variances. Focusing the attention on the 20 smart contracts with the topmost number of transactions, we found that most of them represent financial smart contracts and some of them have peculiar software development stories behind them. The results show that blockchain software is rapidly changing and evolving and it is no longer devoted only to cryptovalues applications but to general purpose computation.

AB Each manufacturer, supplier, and retailer has its own chain of collaborating stakeholders to meet their customer demands Many perspectives can be taken like food safety, security, and sustainability, which may each lead to separate solutions that are not necessarily interoperable with each other. Data can only be shared within the context of those solutions and only with extra effort, and thus costs, across these solutions. To address this solution, this paper proposes a methodological approach for specification of data that can be shared with rapid deployment by for instance a blockchain based - or a peer-to-peer infrastructure. The methodological approach is based on basic informatics principles like the Turing machine and ontologies. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

DE technology; education; innovation
AB Technology is seen as an enabler for gaining new capabilities in universities. Nowadays, higher education institutions have seen how technology enhances the competitive advantage for not only the business environment but as well for their teachers and students. Innovation is mainstream and is creating opportunities to access and learn technologies that were not possible before. Universities should no longer be behind technology compared with other sectors. Although this is not yet explored, new technologies that as next-generation security, the blockchain, cloud, AI conversational interface, and digital credentials can be leverage from different industries. Innovative thinking on the basis of which institutions collaborate with various suppliers, distributors and customers to generate unique value easily replaces the traditional thinking that considers innovation as a property and marketing activity as a static show in one direction. Personalization is the key to offering quality services, and this is what disruptive technologies are offering. Universities have to focus on technologies that are appropriate for their strategy but at the same time to align with key market trends. Students are being more informed and empowered by personal devices that help and assist them in fulfilling their tasks and goals. Anticipating and meeting their needs and expectations suppose automating process and increasing digitization offering in universities. People and things are exchanging data at every moment. The barrier between the digital world and the physical world is crumbling which implies that higher education institutes need to be aligned with them for attracting and retaining students. The most significant technological opportunity for today's institution is to reduce total spend by targeted IT investments that are converted from fixed capital models to a variable cost operating models. Collaboration and co-creation are increasingly crucial for creating value for students and teachers."value" (including the age-old issue of cost optimization) but also higher levels of customer experience.

DE blockchain; medical records; privacy protection; data masking
AB The emergence of electronic medical records has provided great convenience for the storage and analysis of medical data. However, electronic medical records contain a large amount of personal privacy information, it is still very difficult to share medical information among various medical institutions. As the underlying technology of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, security, trustworthiness, collective maintenance, and cannot be tampered, it is suitable for data protection and sharing. In this paper, data masking technology and Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) are introduced to build a safe and efficient electronic medical record sharing model based on blockchain. The model can not only guarantee the security of medical data, but also save resources in blockchain.

AB With the development of Blockchain, more and more distributed cryptocurrencies continue to emerge. Most of these currencies use cryptographic techniques (such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, etc.) to enhance privacy protection, but at the same time the regulatory authorities have no access to audit transactions. Most existing auditing schemes are based on centralized system and cannot be directly applied to distributed cryptocurrencies. Therefore, an Auditable Zerocoin with User Awareness (AZUA) scheme which supports privacy protection and auditability simultaneously is proposed in this paper. Aiming to ensure that auditors can audit Zerocoin's transactions, auditability is defined in this paper. Meanwhile, in order to prevent auditors from abusing their power, a new security property is proposed: user awareness auditing. Moreover, taking transaction privacy issue into consideration, indistinguishability of audit information is defined. The transaction auditing from auditors is achieved in AZUA through the encryption scheme, which ensures the honesty of the auditors by introducing a commitment mechanism and that the users can be aware of whether they have been audited according to randomized public keys. Finally, it is proved that the scheme can satisfy auditability, user awareness auditing and indistinguishability of audit information simultaneously.

AB Cryptocurrency is a digital currency with cryptographic security so that it is not easily to be faked. Recently cryptocurrency is widely used for transactions. Therefore, preserving its integrity and security is important. The technology underlying the digital currency is the Blockchain, as applied to Fawkescoin. But for securing the transaction, fawkescoin has a disadvantage when the fork occurs because it can provide opportunity to conduct double spending attack. To overcome this problem, Merkle tree proposed by applying DSA digital signatures. The application of DSA on Merkle tree is used to verify data without knowing the contents of the data. Based on the experiment results and analysis, the security of the proposed method can prevent fawkescoin against double spending attack on transactions when forking occurs than the previous method.

AB Blockchain may have a potential to prove its value for the new US FDA regulatory requirements defined in the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) as innovative solutions are needed to support the highly complex pharmaceutical industry supply chain as it seeks to comply. In this paper, we examine how blockchain can be applied to meet with the security compliance requirement for the pharmaceutical supply chain. We explore the online playground of Hyperledger Composer, a set of tools for building blockchain business networks, to model the data and access control rules for the drug supply chain. Our experiment shows that this solution can provide a prototyping opportunity for compliance checking with certain limitations.

DE Connected vehicles; blockchain; Tangle; security
AB Connected vehicles are designed to make informed safety-related decisions based on the data/information they receive from various on-board sensors and other vehicles in their vicinity. However, attacks directed towards on-board sensors and network attacks on the wireless communication channels can adversely impact the correctness and integrity of this information and present a grave security and safety challenge to connected vehicles. Current centralized security solutions are not a good fit as they do not scale well and are unable to validate the correctness of the shared data. Decentralizing security provisioning in connected vehicles by means of the blockchain technology is an interesting alternative for overcoming these limitations. However, current permission-less linear hash-chain based blockchain solutions have low transaction throughput, high computational cost and are resource intensive, thereby making their adoption for designing a security solution for resource constrained connected cars difficult. In this paper, we present TangleCV, a decentralized technique for secure message sharing for connected vehicles using an approach like Tangle, a directed acyclic graph based blockchain architecture. We introduce an initial design of TangleCV and describe how it provides improved efficiency and scalability against information correctness and information integrity attacks in connected vehicle networks.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of breakthrough technological areas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the internet of things, and blockchain upon on conventional banking professions and skill sets. Our conclusions are based upon a large array of data collected over the course of a survey of top personnel conducted in 2017-2018 using text mining, case studies, and expert interviews. The changing requirements for workers and their competences were assessed taking into account the level of technological development (including use of relevant products and services by Russian and international companies) as well as the probability of certain professional skills being substituted by automated solutions in the medium term. The results indicate that technologies' impact upon various functional segments of banks' operations is varied. While most of the analyzed professions are evolving towards broader functionality, others are sliding into the "obsolete" group. In the next few years, automated systems will take full responsibility for data collection and its initial analysis, though they will not replace bank personnel fully given that they simply remain tools that help boost workers' productivity and efficiency, extend the information base, accelerate decision-making, cut costs, and reduce risks.

AB With the adjustment of the world's energy structure, the proportion of clean energy represented by renewable energy is increasing. In response to the shortcomings of renewable energy instability, researchers have proposed the concept of the microgrid. However, with the expansion of the scale of the promotion of the microgrid, the traditional energy distribution system with the sales company as the core exposes the shortcomings of being inflexible. Based on this researcher's continuous exploration of new energy trading models, the energy blockchain has developed rapidly in recent years. Reliable private key storage is a necessary guarantee for the security of energy blockchain services. At present, blockchain private key storage technology still has many security risks in the new energy transaction mode. This paper first builds an energy blockchain platform inside the microgrid, so that all participants can complete energy transactions more safely and conveniently. At the same time, the energy blockchain private key storage technology based on image information hiding is proposed. The blockchain private key is hidden in the watermark information and embedded in the carrier image. A watermarking algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform and quantization index modulation is used to accurately extract the blockchain private key. Finally, the feasibility and security of the algorithm are proved by an example test analysis.

AB Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an emerging data collection paradigm that exploits the potential of individual mobile devices to acquire mass data in a cost-effective manner. One of the important challenges in MCS application is to resist malicious users who provide false data to disturb the system. In the existing work, the reputation management scheme is an effective way to overcome the challenge. However, most reputation management schemes rely on a semi-honest server and process data in the plaintext domain without considering server security and user privacy. In this paper, we integrate the blockchain and edge computing in the MCS scenario to construct a credible and efficient blockchain-based MCS system, called BC-MCS. To resist malicious users, we present a privacy-preserving reputation management scheme based on the proposed system. Furthermore, we design a delegation protocol to solve the inherent problem of user dynamics in the MCS. The prototype system implemented on the Hyperledger Sawtooth and Android client demonstrates that our scheme can achieve higher utility and security levels in handling malicious users compared with the previous centralized reputation management schemes.

AB In the current identity management process, the problems such as increasing differentiation of digital identities, fragmentation and centralisation of identity information have been exposed. In this paper, a framework, named EverSSDI, using smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain is constructed, which provides a unique identifier to normalise differentiated user identities. A fine-grained authorisation mechanism is designed based on the Hierarchical Deterministic protocol (HD protocol) to solve the fragmentation problem of identity information. Besides, a reliable information verification mechanism is elaborated to enhance the credibility of the digital information. In addition, two novel methods are proposed for identity recovery, one of which is based on Social Networking Services (SNS) authorisation and the other Ethereum Oracles. The final implementation and discussion show that the user has self-sovereign management authority, which enables the user to become the real dominant of his/her identity rather than only a prover of digital identity.

   investment programs)
AB Bitcoin is one of the most popular decentralized cryptocurrencies to date. However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate.

AB The emergence of Internet protocol suites and packet-switching technologies tends to the considerations of security, privacy, scalability, and reliability in layered Internet service architectures. The existing service systems allow us to access big data, but few studies focus on the fundamental security and stability in these systems, especially when they involve large-scale networks with overloaded private information. In this paper, we explored the blockchain-based mechanism that aims to improve the critical features of traditional Internet services, including autonomous and decentralized processing, smart contractual enforcement of goals, and traceable trustworthiness in tamper-proof transactions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review to conceptualize the blockchain-based framework to develop the decentralized protocols for the extensive number of Internet services. This comprehensive survey aims to address blockchain integration to secure Internet services and identify the critical requirements of developing a decentralized trustworthy Internet service. Additionally, we present a case study of the blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) for neuro-informatics to illustrate the potential applications of blockchain architectures. Finally, we summarize the trends and challenges of blockchain architectures that benefit a multitude of disciplines across all the Internet service fields of interest.

A large amount of information is required to be extracted from this substantially available data that provides numerous benefits such as improved quality of life, disease diagnosis, treatment and healthcare service delivery system. The big data generated in the healthcare is characterized by large volume, heterogeneity and speed. The other issues associated with the healthcare big data include non-uniform data, large number of variables, and need for real-time data analysis. In this paper, we examine the existing literature in all the databases within the ISI Web of Science with the purpose of reviewing the current research and develop a new agenda. Total 91 papers, classified in five research categories namely, general healthcare, clinical diagnosis and research, service delivery system, disease transmission and prevention, and health insurance were reviewed. Reviewing past work is focused on identifying areas where big data analytics (BDA) is being applied in healthcare management. The outcome of the review is a proposed framework on BDA capability and its impact on healthcare organization performance.

AB The main goal of the research is to assess the potential of using an innovative blockchain technology in the oil and gas industry in Russia, to increase the competitiveness of Russian companies in the international arena, and to contribute to development of a successful partnership between the state and business. In the age of research and development, technologies evolve to such an extent that new ideas, as soon as they emerge, instantly become obsolete and evaporate in a flash. What are the most advanced of the latest technologies, which the whole world is watching for today. The application of innovative technologies is the main benefit of any industry that is open for their use. Industrial complexes in the field of oil and gas extraction monitor closely the situation of developing new technologies. However, the fact that the oil and gas industries are of global importance, these industries are old-fashioned activities that do not hurry to apply new technologies. Considering the number of daily processes occurring in the natural resources sector, we need to move beyond the usual manner of doing business. Oil and gas companies should introduce a simplified form of document management by using safe technologies. Millions of new technologies can positively or negatively influence the development of the fuel and energy complex. Therefore, the most important thing is to evaluate technologies, analyze their suitability for the industry and determine priorities for further opportunities. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy

AB Aiming at the problem that a large number of students' electronic deposit data is easy to forge and destroy, a student electronic deposit application architecture based on blockchain is proposed. There are some features on blockchain, such as decentralized, the non-tamperable of data, the consensus mechanism and data encryption features, and the electronic depository network. All these features provide a secure and credible storage environment, ensures the traceable of the student's electronic deposit information, the trust of the entire network, and the security of the data. At the same time, an improved PBFT consensus algorithm is proposed, which eliminates the certificate elimination phase to reduce network resource consumption, and constructs a decentralized electronic depository platform in combination with the blockchain to realize the authenticity, integrity and reliability of the electronic certificate data. The further development and application of blockchain technology is prospected, hoping to provide inspiration and reference for future related research.

AB Honeypot technology can be applied to efficiently attract attackers and exhaust their resources. However, the traditional static honeypot is easy to be recognized by anti-honeypot technology. By contrast, most of the dynamic honeypots can simulate the real system in time, thus interacting with an intruder in disguise. In this paper, we employ the dynamic property of honeypot in four kinds of services of our system. However, this dynamic property shows up in a location and identification, indicating that genuine or fake services (honeypots) are changeable in different hosts. Thus, the dynamic property of our system differs from the dynamic honeypot aforementioned. Besides, we adopt the blockchain platform (Ethereum) to decentralize our system and store the port access data by delivering a private chain. To illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme in theory and practice, security analysis, eavesdropping attack, scanning attack, and DoS attack experiments are conducted. The results show that our scheme is valid in safeguarding against network attack.

AB Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming. The paper offers a case study to design contracts by users. The designed contracts were validated on the existing system to implement the food trading and traders' credit evaluation. The experimental results show that the designed smart contracts achieve good integration with the existing system and they can be deployed and compiled successfully.

AB The globalized production and the distribution of agriculture production bring a renewed focus on the safety, quality, and the validation of several important criteria in agriculture and food supply chains. The growing number of issues related to food safety and contamination risks has established an immense need for effective traceability solution that acts as an essential quality management tool ensuring adequate safety of products in the agricultural supply chain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can provide an innovative solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. Today's agricultural supply chains are complex ecosystem involving several stakeholders making it cumbersome to validate several important criteria such as country of origin, stages in crop development, conformance to quality standards, and monitor yields. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts efficiently perform business transactions for soybean tracking and traceability across the agricultural supply chain. Our proposed solution eliminates the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transactions records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security. The proposed solution focuses on the utilization of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions among all the participants involved within the supply chain ecosystem. All transactions are recorded and stored in the blockchain's immutable ledger with links to a decentralized file system (IPFS) and thus providing to all a high level of transparency and traceability into the supply chain ecosystem in a secure, trusted, reliable, and efficient manner.

AB Blockchain is regarded as a revolutionary technology, which is widely used in different fields all over world, especially for the application in energy field. With the development of distributed generation, there's a greater opportunity for distributed generation trading. In the near future, everyone may be able to sell their surplus electricity generated by their rooftop photovoltaic. It can be determined that blockchain can increase the trust between transactors. Blockchain can provide convenience for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In addition, blockchain can be used in other energy fields such as IOT, shared EV charging pile and etc. Because of the above advantages, many countries in the world are developing energy blockchain and have built some applied engineering programs. Some representative projects in US are introduced in this paper, and advanced technologies adopted in these existing projects are also analyzed. Finally, suggestions for developing energy blockchain technology and conclusions are given. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rural areas in developing countries have constantly been plagued by poor sanitation and energy shortages. A key issue has been the decentralized nature of waste generation and energy consumption, leading to farmers burning crop stocks, lumber, and other agricultural waste. As 1.9 billion people lack access to waste collection services [1], untreated solid and liquid refuse hamper the health of many and irreversibly damage the local ecosystem. Considering the scattered nature of agricultural waste generation and centralized treatment difficulties, this study examines the feasibility of adopting decentralized blockchain system in trading biomass energy and agricultural products across the waste-to-energy ecosystem. A case study is conducted based on the Yitong system in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China. This plant collects and transports agricultural wastes (crop straw and animal residue), and converts them to clean energy and agricultural by-products like briquettes, fertilizer, and animal feedstock. This paper presents how a digital coupon or cryptocurrency can be introduced to trade the wastes, energy and byproducts among the farmers and entrepreneurs. It argues that this system could maximize the use of agriculture wastes by incentivizing farmers and enterprises to work together. This paper covers three key areas:
   1) Literature review, methodology preparation, and field assessment for introducing digital incentive mechanism to enhance rural wastes management.
   2) Design of a prototype of blockchain-based model: (a) how the waste-to-energy plant managers collect the segregated waste from individual farmers through trucks connected to blockchain-based smart meters; (b) how systems on each of the trucks register the quantity of waste received onto a universal ledger when collecting. This quantity received will be translated into a certain amount of energy and products like fertilizer that the waste-to-energy plant owes each farm; and (c) how the farmers will receive digital coupons corresponding to the quantity of energy and agricultural products that they should receive.
   3) Evaluation of the feasibility of blockchain-based model (technical and economic): (a) data collection on the total quantity of waste produced and the processing capabilities and availability of Waste to Energy plants; (b) assessing readiness of digital infrastructure (cyber-security and communications); and (c) economic evaluation of the incentives and responsibilities associated with the key stakeholders from the farmers to enterprises.

AB Circular economy is distinct from the linear economy model in the past. Circular economy emphasizes regeneration instead of possession of resource, and proposes using shared resources to create new supply chains and new economies. When practicing circular economy, prior to collaboration, each economic entity must learn of each other's credit rating. This study applies the blockchain technology to establish each economic entity's transaction details, and then employs confidence level algorithms to calculate each entity's credit rating; the method utilizes the concept of decentralization to reduce third party broker fees, which, aside from decreasing transaction costs, provides effective credit rating of public economic entities.

AB The arrival of the Internet era has promoted the development of a large number of emerging technologies, and the logistics industry has also ushered in reform opportunities. To change the problems of high traditional logistics costs and low management level, it is necessary to build a modern logistics system to achieve the goal of reducing logistics costs and promoting national economic growth. The modern logistics system must establish the development goals of informatized, intelligent and traced, and the logistics infrastructure system, logistics operation system and logistics management system are constructed. The four major systems of logistics information system, as well as the infrastructure network, the operation organization network and the intelligent information network, realize the interconnection and interconnection of various systems and networks. In this paper, technologies such as big data, Internet, Internet of Things, cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence are integrated into each system network, and a modern logistics system based on interconnection is creatively proposed.

AB In recent years, blockchain technology has been developing rapidly in social economy. As blockchain technology has many excellent properties, it is used for the transaction of Bitcoin at first. With the rise of Bitcoin, the connection between blockchain technology and financial market will be closer more integrative. And then more and more financial institutions have recognized the importance of blockchain technology and started to try to use this technology in financial operations, such as R3CEV, Hyperledger and Qiwi. Many financial institutions have started trying to apply blockchain technology into financial transactions in order to decrease transaction costs and increase operational efficiencies, especially in financial note, cross-border payment and asset-backed securitization. It can be seen that blockchain technology will have widely application prospects in financial fields in the future.

AB In order to solve the problems of resource sharing difficulties, privacy exposure risks, illegal data invocation and cross-system consistency in traditional audit mode, this paper proposes an online audit mode based on block chain. Firstly, the traditional audit process is analyzed and summarized, and then an audit framework based on block chain is designed. On this basis, a process based on Intelligent contract is designed for the audit mode, and an online audit data platform architecture based on alliance chain is proposed. A feasible online audit under block chain environment is proposed. The implementation method helps to solve the existing problems in auditing. The scheme provided in this paper has a certain operability, which promotes the application of block chain in the field of auditing.

TI No Need to Ask: Creating Permissionless Blockchains of Metadata Records
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article will describe how permission less metadata blockchains could be created to overcome two significant limitations in current cataloging practices: centralization and a lack of traceability. The process would start by creating public and private keys, which could be managed using digital wallet software. After creating a genesis block, nodes would submit either a new record or modifications to a single record for validation. Validation would rely on a Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus algorithm because it offers the most flexibility for institutions to select authoritative peers. Only the top tier nodes would be required to store a copy of the entire blockchain thereby allowing other institutions to decide whether they prefer to use the abridged version or the full version.

TI Chains, Coins and Contract Law: The Validity and Enforceability of Smart
   Contracts
SO AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article considers the validity and enforceability of smart contracts under Australian contract law. Smart contracts are agreements, expressed at least partially in computer code, that utilise distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain to interpret, perform and enforce their terms without human intervention. Smart contracts have already been used in the structure of conditional payments, financial derivatives and investment mechanisms, with scope for much broader application in the near-term. The recent emergence of smart contracts and absence of legislative or judicial intervention has left uncertainty as to their legal validity and position relative to conventional contracts. After outlining the technology's characterisation and operation, this article turns to the question of whether smart contracts are capable of meeting the doctrinal requirements for an enforceable contract in Australian law. In finding that they are, it supports their continued usage and adoption.

AB Recently, the manufacturing industry became aware of distributed ledger technologies, a protocol that, amongst other things, allows trustless transactions between machines. In this paper, we investigate whether an M2M economy would be feasible within the IOTA network, a popular cryptocurrency for IoT. We build and present a simple industrial lot-size one production system involving three agents that cooperate to create an artistic painting. Payments between agents and users are autonomously executed via IOTA. Amongst other points of criticism, we found that an M2M economy would benefit from the support of smart-contracts and conclude that IOTA is not a fitting solution. (C) 2019 The Authors.

DE layered bottlenecks; wake-up profile; thread dependency graph
AB Detection of software bottlenecks which hinder utilizing hardware resources is a classic but complex problem due to the layered structures of the software bottlenecks. However, model-based approaches require a performance model given, which is impractical to maintain under today's agile development environment, and profile-based approaches do not handle the layered structures of the software bottlenecks.
   This paper proposes a novel approach of taking the best of both worlds which extracts a performance model from execution profiles of the target application to detect the layered bottlenecks. We collect a wake-up profile of threads, which samples an event that one thread wakes up another thread, and build a thread dependency graph to detect the layered bottlenecks.
   We implement our approach of profile-based detection of layered bottlenecks in the Go programming language. We demonstrate that our method can detect software bottlenecks limiting scalability and throughput of state-of-the-art middleware such as a web application server and a permissioned blockchain network, with small amount of the runtime overhead for profile collection.

AB As a basic building block of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is substantial for gathering and sending consumption and production data of consumers. The applications facilitated by blockchain technology like local peer to peer (P2P) markets challenge the centrally organized utility industry with its disruptive potential and rely also heavily on AMIs as data source. However, such technologies pose a number of engineering challenges in early stage pilot projects: Unlike centrally managed AMIs, local P2P markets in particular require AMIs to exchange data with their peer devices, which increases the communication requirements due to the decentral nature of blockchain networks. In this paper, we compare the bandwidth requirement of real-time AMI with the requirements for a blockchain managed peer to peer market. By benchmarking both a normal operation and a high throughput scenario we find a ten times higher demand in bandwidth of the blockchain-based solution compared to real-time AMI and select the appropriate communication technology for an upcoming field test.

AB Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the storage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on mobile cloud environments, where mobile devices are integrated with cloud computing to facilitate medical data exchanges among patients and healthcare providers. This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in lightweight access control design, minimum network latency with high security and data privacy levels, compared to the existing data sharing models.

AB The traditional electricity markets are facing challenges in integrating the distributed generation extensively. However, the local energy markets have the potential to support the local integration of DG and facilitate the local balance of energy supply and demand. The operation and management of local energy markets require support from the efficient and reliable information technology. Blockchain technology has the potential to be used in local energy trading, but it is difficult to support frequent trades among the rising number of market participants, due to the basic design principle of the technology. Therefore, we present the offchain energy trading method and an asynchronous transaction recording mechanism to ensure the efficiency of energy trading procedures. To support off-chain energy trading, we design a local energy trading cyber-physical system. The overview of the local energy market and the framework of the blockchain-based local energy trading system are illustrated respectively.

AB Blockchain technology is transforming traditional financial systems. Cross-border money remittance industry is in a crossroad being challenged. The traditional SWIFT system is facing new comers like Ripple system which is based on the blockchain distributed ledger technology with its own crypto tokens. This paper conducts a SWOT analysis on both technologies to find out whether the blockchain technology has the potential to transform a traditional industry and how this may be possible. We conclude that Ripple has all of the advantages over SWIFT despite some minor issues. In short-term, SWIFT will still take the lead in the remittance market due to the economy of scale. However, in long-term, emerging technology like Ripple will eventually revolutionize the remittance industry or even other financial systems. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Block chain has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, autonomy; information cannot be altered forged and so on. It is superior to centralized database in data security and data sharing. Many industries have actively carried out the application research of block chain. The judicial departments have very high requirements for data sharing and data security. The application of block chain is also feasible. This paper studies and analyzes the principle, types and development trend of block chain technology, and puts forward the value of block chain application in the management of judicial evidence data. Taking the case investigation evidence information management as an example, we constructed a "coalition chain" structure of evidence storage, consensus mechanism and block data structure, so as to realize the data sharing and security management within the coalition.

AB Token represents the right to do some operations in software. In blockchain, there are two types of tokens: utility token and security token. They endow the items of token more value in blockchain world. In order to achieve asset tokenization, we propose a new kind of token in this paper, the asset-backed token, which is used for the proposed blockchain based Open Asset Protocol (OAP). Using OAP, we show to how to convert both of the real and virtual objects to asset-backed tokens on blockchain. Then we discussed a new method for data utilization and privacy-preserving based on OAP and compare with our previous scheme, the Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). Additionally, we introduce the Policy-Backed Token(PBT), which is an instance implementing OAP in insurance industry. We have applied PBT in the airline travel insurance product E-life of an insurance company.

AB This paper investigates how mobility affects the performance of a blockchain system operating in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The mobility of nodes incurs a unique challenge to a blockchain system due to continuous change and dynamicity in the connectivity of the nodes. Specifically, the mobility makes a proof-of-work (PoW) process difficult since while moving the nodes can only have a limited length of time for a "rendezvous" to exchange a new block for verification. For this reason, accurate modeling for the block exchange behavior in a VANET is also challenging, which nevertheless has not been discussed in previous studies. Therefore, this paper provides an analysis framework that formulates the impact of mobility on a blockchain system's performance in a VANET based on three key metrics: (i) the probability of a successful addition of block to the chain; (ii) the stability of a rendezvous, and; (iii) the number of blocks exchanged during a rendezvous. The closed-form expressions and numerical results display the performance of a blockchain system in various scenarios in a VANET.

TI Collusion attacks and fair time-locked deposits for fast-payment
   transactions in Bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY

DT Article
DE Bitcoin; fair deposit; double-spending; collusion attacks; time-locked
AB In Bitcoin network, the distributed storage of multiple copies of the block chain opens up possibilities for double-spending, i.e., a payer issues two separate transactions to two different payees transferring the same coins. While Bitcoin has inherent security mechanism to prevent double-spending attacks, it requires a certain amount of time to detect the double-spending attacks after the transaction has been initiated. Therefore, it is impractical to protect the payees from suffering in double-spending attacks in fast payment scenarios where the time between the exchange of currency and goods or services is shorten to few seconds. Although we cannot prevent double-spending attacks immediately for fast payments, decentralized non-equivocation contracts have been proposed to penalize the malicious payer after the attacks have been detected. The basic idea of these contracts is that the payer locks some coins in a deposit when he initiates a transaction with the payee. If the payer double-spends, a cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions can be used to reveal his Bitcoin credentials for the deposit. Thus, the malicious payer could be penalized by the loss of deposit coins. However, such decentralized non-equivocation contracts are subjected to collusion attacks where the payer colludes with the beneficiary of the depoist and transfers the Bitcoin deposit back to himself when he double-spends, resulting in no penalties. On the other hand, even if the beneficiary behaves honestly, the victim payee cannot get any compensation directly from the deposit in the original design.
   To prevent such collusion attacks, we design fair time-locked deposits for Bitcoin transactions to defend against double-spending. The fair deposits ensure that the payer will be penalized by the loss of his deposit coins if he double-spends and the victim payee's loss will be compensated within a locked time period. We start with the protocols of making a deposit for one transaction. In particular, for the transaction with single input and output and the transaction with multiple inputs and outputs, we provide different designs of the deposits. We analyze the performance of deposits made for one transaction and show how the fair deposits work efficiently in Bitcoin. We also provide protocols of making a deposit for multiple transactions, which can reduce the burdens of a honest payer. In the end, we extend the fair deposits to non-equivocation contracts for other distributed systems.

AB Distributed credit networks, such as Ripple [19] and Stellar [23], are becoming popular as an alternative means for financial transactions. However, the current designs do not preserve user privacy or are not truly decentralized. In this paper, we explore the creation of a distributed credit network that preserves user and transaction privacy and unlinkability. We propose BlAnC, a novel, fully decentralized blockchain-based credit network where credit transfer between a sender-receiver pair happens on demand. In BlAnC, multiple concurrent transactions can occur seamlessly, and malicious network actors that do not follow the protocols and/or disrupt operations can be identified efficiently.
   We perform security analysis of our proposed protocols in the universal composability framework to demonstrate its strength, and discuss how our network handles operational dynamics. We also present preliminary experiments and scalability analyses.

AB Blockchains (BCs) received significant attentions from FinTeh in recent years. Many proof-of-concepts (POCs) projects and experiments have been carried out to explore the strengths and weaknesses of constructing financial market infrastructures upon BCs. The experiments showed that considerable improvements are still necessary to meet financial requirements such as safety, efficiency, reliability, scalability, security and transparency. The Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI), issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement System (CPSS) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is a key standard for designing Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) so that global financial markets could be more robust and stable, especially, could withstand financial shocks. It is thus necessary to design BC-based FMIs according to PFMI. This position paper analyzes financial system requirements and the challenges, and discusses the design issues of BCs in meeting PFMI.

AB The concerns held on the scalability of permissionless Blockchain platforms are a significant hindrance to their wider adoption. To address this issue rigorously, we consider it opportune to assess the current implementation and the associated improvement proposals, within a single coherent evaluation framework. This work addresses this specific question in the particular context of Ethereum, a prominent implementation of Blockchain, using a threefold approach. First, it maps the internal constituents of Ethereum onto a layered architecture inspired in the ISO/OSI model, so that its provisioning organization can be better understood. Second, it employs the AKF Scale Cube to analyze the pros and cons of the present specification of Ethereum, as well as of the current improvement proposals, so that the scalability challenges can be reasoned about in an orderly fashion. Finally, it uses an extensible test environment with synthetic benchmarks so that the transaction throughput of the current implementation of Ethereum can be evaluated in a private scenario, when no smart contract is to run. Our conclusions suggest that Ethereum respects the scalability trilemma being versed on security and decentralization renouncing scalability. These limits can be mitigated by adopting novel solutions such as Plasma and Sharding which enable a significant increment of performance by partitioning the data, and, ultimately, unlocking parallel execution of the transactions.

AB In unmanned collaborative cognition scenarios, traditional IoT systems are facing with data security and node privacy problems. However, blockchain together with data encryption technique enables the trustless network due to the tamper-proof, anonymity and unbreakable properties. Nevertheless, there are still some shortages when combining blockchain with IoT systems, for example the storage consumption. Generally speaking, validation nodes in blockchain network need to store a complete copy of the ledger so as to verify transactions and reach the whole network consensus. However, in unmanned collaborative cognition scenarios, many devices' storage capacity are limited. Therefore, in order to solve the storage problem, we propose LS4BUCC, a low overhead storage architecture regarding to the new features of unmanned collaborative cognition systems. It selectively stores data according to the value density. Based on three storage mechanisms and two supportive methods, LS4BUCC can reduce the data storage and maintain the system security and efficiency at the same time.

AB With the development of the Internet of Vehicles, more and more applications require collaboration between vehicles. Vehicles from different car manufacturers have their own private clouds, and the collaboration between them is poor, resulting in inefficient collaboration between heterogeneous vehicles. A single cloud lacks collaboration between vehicles and it's an inevitable trend for developing collaboration between clouds. JointCloud is a new computing model in which collaboration services provided between clouds are used to server users in a software-defined manner based on blockchain. This paper proposes the collaboration framework of multiple vehicle clouds, introduces the blockchain to establish the coordination mechanism, and describes standardization method and service combination method of the vehicular cloud service in detail. At the end of this paper, we designed a distributed cloud service evaluation method based on blockchain to provide users with an effective cloud service evaluation solution.

AB With the development of cloud computing, a great amount of information is stored on cloud, such as Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Single cloud or company is not reliable enough for permanent information storage. Once the cloud or company is in downtime, users could lost their information. Multiple clouds can store the information with more security. However, in JointCloud environment, it is a big problem for multiple clouds or companies to maintain the common rights of information for each user. In this paper, we propose EtherShare, a blockchain-based application in JointCloud environment. EtherShare enables users to share information with permanent storage and open access. It keeps the rights of users through smart contracts to make consensus between multiple clouds. And this application is open source on Github.

AB The software-defined network implements the separation of software and hardware, as well as a programmable network. however, the lack of consistent records of network data poses difficulties for network management, and heterogeneous device heterogeneity poses a hindrance to software-defined network interoperability. This paper summarizes the development status and existing problems of software-defined network, proposes a software-defined network data chain based on blockchain, realizes distributed consistent record of software-defined network data, and breaks the multi-vendor device isolation for fault recovery. Reduce the cost of network failure recovery and achieve unified scheduling of business capabilities.

AB Prior to blockchain technology coming into much usage, the earlier cryptographic digital cash schemes relied merely on trusted authorities. Bitcoin revolutionized this conventional view of a cryptocurrency, trading decentralized, distributed ledger, completely secured by the majority rule without predetermined authority or owner. Only standard cryptographic primitives such as signatures and hash functions were used to achieve security. Though other cryptocurrencies such as Bit-gold and B-money which are among the authority free cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the first one to experience public acceptance on a large scale. There are various factors which contribute to Bitcoins success, though there is still a little question of doubt that the decentralized design of blockchain technology and perceived resilience to government or third-party intervention played an extremely crucial role in its uptake. Distributed crypto cash, more specifically in Blockchain technology has hailed as one key and most eminent and widely accepted innovation of Bitcoin. In this paper we have worked on the use of blockchain technology to implement cryptocurrency for IOT.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) devices currently rely on centralized, brokered conununication models which call for a number of security flaws and threats. Privacy & security remain a challenge owing to the existing systems being centralized creating a single point of failure. In this paper, we lay out an architecture for incorporating a concept similar to Blockchain the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to provide decentralized security and privacy for loT devices. Currently, the issue with most loT devices is that they lack the processing power, storage and computational overhead to run consensus algorithms to be an active part of the Blockchain network The current issue with the blockchain on the other hand, is its low scalability and low number of transactions per second. We present an innovative approach using a technology called IOTA. This addresses some of the most important problems with existing blockchain infrastructure such as being able to run on lightweight devices with constrained memory. We eliminate transaction fees and the concept of mining which requires a large amount of processing power to compete with other miners. IOTA's main component is the Tangle, a guided acyclic graph (DAG) for transaction storage. We discuss creation of two IoT applications on the tangle - a smart utility meter system and a smart car transaction system which are connected to internet through Low Power Wide Area IoT networks.

AB The electronic authentication system authenticates the documents electronically using the blockchain technology, which enables us to implement an integrated system of official documents of all kinds for Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan. This technology allows us to build a robust database system that cannot be tampered with, modified, destroyed or altered. It further ensures the safety of documents issued within the University departments and those exported or deported outside the University system; such as, financial documents, official documents and academic certificates. Moreover, this system guarantees us a very high level of data and information security and confidentiality. Our system will be built using a database that provides 100% true information about the exports of that system. This technology will help users prevent the forgery of the data and official documents issued by the University of Al-Zaytoonah, both internally and externally, and also enables the departments within the University to issue documents to third parties while ensuring confirmed, undeniable delivery and sound content.

AB Blockchain Technology has been proposed to tackle author, centrality and storage issues. It converts centralized applications into dynamic distributed ones. Many researchers have proposed protocols and applications for mapping the old central applications into blockchain based distributed application. In this work, new system framework for Public World Wide Used Motor Vehicle History Reporting System, named CarChain, is proposed and designed. The new framework has not been constructed based on any of the popular well-known public blockchain networks. The framework constructs a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network that broadcasts transactions as any end system multicasting system in P2P live streaming applications. The framework allows car owners, repairing companies and insurance agencies to register and add new histories for cars in a simple method. Four different smart contracts control block updates in CarChain. In addition, database technology has been leveraged to cache intermediate data. We show in this paper the challenges and research opportunities that encounter blockchain based applications, such as CarChain.

AB The Blockchain technology has been one of the major innovations in recent years. Crypto-currencies and decentralized applications are increasingly adopted. Their principles led the foundation for new ideas underlying others distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In particular, decentralized storage employs non-recursive functions and similar algorithms compared to the Blockchain technology. Furthermore, digital signatures procedures have been used for storage validation. This paper summarizes IPFS and Swarm technologies and exposes how we managed to hide our malware on distributed storage. Our demonstration's results illustrate the possibility to hide malicious content by segregating it and reveal that decentralized storages have many concerns and lack security verification procedures.

AB Demand reduction, also known as Negawatts or negative watts, has emerged as another commodity that can be exchanged. This paper discusses conceptual architecture of a blockchain-based negawatt trading platform implemented on Hyperledger. Two trading scenarios are discussed. The first scenario involves negawatt trading between a demand response aggregator and buildings. The second scenario discusses negawatt trading among buildings to meet the contract shortfalls of buildings in the first scenario. Participants, assets, transactions and transaction flows of both scenarios are described, together with the smart contracts that describe how buyers and sellers are compensated for their negawatt exchange. Case studies are implemented and compared.

TI Private Law Regulation of Innovations and Creditors' Rights: What We Can
   Learn from Domain Name Rights for Blockchain Rights
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
LA English
DT Article
DE Private law regulation of innovations; property v. contract law;
   transfer, pledge, attachment, seizure, forced sale; bottom-up
   self-regulation v. state legislation; domain name rights;
   cryptocurrencies, blockchain rights
AB The most significant innovation in recent years has been blockchain technology. Such innovations demand a response from the law. The most significant innovation of the last twenty-five years has been the internet. The relative lack of government regulation in the domain of public law has been one of the key features of the internet. The private law regulation of domain name rights has been left to private institutions to arrange this through contract law. Contract law, however, has its limitations when it comes to pledging, seizing and the forced sale of domain name rights. Qualification problems with regard to the nature of domain name rights and the prescribed mode of contract renewal have resulted in difficulties with respect to pledging and seizing domain name rights. These cannot be solved by bottom-up self-regulation. I will demonstrate this by discussing the law in the Belgian, Dutch, German and American jurisdictions. In particular, I will address the unique bottom-up self-regulation of domain name rights in the Netherlands, which aims to replace statutory rules in the field of property law by contractual provisions. Lastly, I will discuss what we can learn from domain name rights for blockchain rights. I will argue that, learning from domain name rights, we should not try to fit in similar issues with regard to blockchain rights in existing private law or contractual arrangements, but should develop tailor-made statutory private law rules so as to avoid the same legal uncertainty as with domain name rights.

AB With the widespread popularity of Internet-enabled devices, mobile users can request and receive messages anytime and anywhere, which facilitates information feedback for smart city management. However, few people are willing to reflect or report some violations of law and discipline around them, and more people choose to ignore. In general, there are two major reasons for this phenomenon. First, reporting with a real name is highly recommended, but it is difficult to send trusted and reliable reporting messages without revealing the reporter's identity. Second, generally no benefit, users usually lack the motivation to report due to worrying about being retaliated. In this paper, we propose an effective anonymous reporting system called ReportCoin, a novel Blockchain-based incentive anonymous reporting system. ReportCoin guarantees user identity privacy and reporting message reliability throughout the reporting process. On the one hand, ReportCoin allows nondeterministic mobile users to vote the reporting by signing and to send anonymous announcements in the non-fully trusted network. On the other hand, ReportCoin motivates users with incentives to report without worrying about the disclosure of identity information to be retaliated. Meanwhile, account information and transaction records in ReportCoin are open, transparent, and tamper-resistant. The theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that ReportCoin is efficient and practical.

AB Blockchain, as the underlying technology of crypto-currencies, has attracted significant attention. It has been adopted in numerous applications, such as smart grid and Internet-of-Things. However, there is a significant scalability barrier for blockchain, which limits its ability to support services with frequent transactions. On the other side, edge computing is introduced to extend the cloud resources and services to be distributed at the edge of the network, but currently faces challenges in its decentralized management and security. The integration of blockchain and edge computing into one system can enable reliable access and control of the network, storage, and computation distributed at the edges, hence providing a large scale of network servers, data storage, and validity computation near the end in a secure manner. Despite the prospect of integrated blockchain and edge computing systems, its scalability enhancement, self organization, functions integration, resource management, and new security issues remain to be addressed before widespread deployment. In this survey, we investigate some of the work that has been done to enable the integrated blockchain and edge computing system and discuss the research challenges. We identify several vital aspects of the integration of blockchain and edge computing: motivations, frameworks, enabling functionalities, and challenges. Finally, some broader perspectives are explored.

AB The blockchain technology has revolutionized the digital currency space with the pioneering cryptocurrency platform named Bitcoin. From an abstract perspective, a blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of maintaining an immutable log of transactions happening in a network. In recent years, this technology has attracted significant scientific interest in research areas beyond the financial sector, one of them being the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, the blockchain is seen as the missing link toward building a truly decentralized, trustless, and secure environment for the IoT and, in this survey, we aim to shape a coherent and comprehensive picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. We start with fundamental working principles of blockchains and how blockchain-based systems achieve the characteristics of decentralization, security, and auditability. From there, we build our narrative on the challenges posed by the current centralized IoT models, followed by recent advances made both in industry and research to solve these challenges and effectively use blockchains to provide a decentralized, secure medium for the IoT.

DE Ethereum Mining Pools; Discrete-event Simulation; Mining Pool Attacks
AB Mining pools in Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies allow miners to pool their computational resources as a means of reducing pay-out variance. In Ethereum, uncle blocks are valid Proof-of-Work solutions which do not become the head of the blockchain, yet yield rewards if later referenced by main chain blocks. Mining pool operators are faced with the non-trivial task of fairly distributing rewards for both block types among pool participants.
   Inspired by empirical observations, we formally reconstruct a Sybil attack exploiting the uncle block distribution policy in a queue-based mining pool. To ensure fairness of the queue-based payout scheme, we propose a mitigation. We examine the effectiveness of the attack strategy under the current and the proposed policy via a discrete-event simulation. Our findings show that the observed attack can indeed be obviated by altering the current reward scheme.

AB This paper is devoted to both the detection of transactions that can participate in money laundering schemes and the possibility of modification of payment systems based on blockchain technology in the interests of AML/CFT. In the process of work, the research of transaction anonymization method with the use of a decentralized approach based on Coin Join transactions is performed. Also, methods of tracking such transactions, the possibility of their deanonymization and the ability to determine the relationships between users and their transactions are examined. The results show that tracking Coin Join transactions is a feasible task that allows to determine the fact of user participation in the creation of a transaction, which gives additional advantages in the process of detecting transactions involved in money laundering schemes.

AB this paper discusses the use of Blockchain technology without tokens to protect information about banking transactions, namely, transfer amounts, card details, names of participants, etc. This topic is relevant, since the digital economy is becoming an integral part of modern life. The processed information passes through the database of banks and payment systems, which potentially makes it available to the attacker.
   The article analyzes the protection mechanisms of distributed databases, proposes a solution to the problem of maintaining the uniqueness of information in them based on Blockchain technology without tokens and gives recommendations on the introduction of Blockchain technology into modern banking systems.

AB The paper presents the needs to improve the controlling systems in public utilities. One example was the use of blockchain technology in the work of the management company that supports the buildings. The method of such technology in the public utilities management system ensures the transparency of mutual obligations and information security between the consumer and the service provider. This leads to the embodiment in reality of the basic principles of effective relationships: the balance of interests of market participants and the openness of interaction.

ID TRACEABILITY
AB Distributed ledger/blockchain has emerged as an important technology that can have a significant impact on the management of supply chains. This paper investigates the feasibility of adopting blockchain technology in both manufacturing and perishable goods supply chains. Two cases are used to illustrate the approach proposed in this work. The first case addresses the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain of composite materials in order to facilitate the certification process of components made of carbon fiber employed in the aerospace sector. The second case investigates the feasibility of adopting blockchain technology in the supply chain of live seafood. In the first case blockchain technology has the potential to be used by industry peers to perform experimental validation tests including flammability, crashworthiness, operational, etc. Additionally in both cases blockchain technology can be used for transportation, handling and storage, not to mention tamper proof checks, product history and provenance tracking.

AB Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are the collection of patient's health data systematically in a digital format. They eliminate the complicated paper-based medical records and ensure the accuracy and legibility of health data to improve quality care. As the amount of the EMRs explosion, the traditional medical system is unable to equip with sufficient storage and computing capacities. Therefore, it is crucial to outsourcing this EMRs to the cloud server, which is a flexible and cost-effective mode in data management. However, the loss of control over the patient's EMRs makes it a severe challenge in the integrity of outsourced data. In this paper, we propose an efficient certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme without bilinear pairing for the EMRs stored in the cloud medical server. A formal security proof on the random oracle model demonstrates the security of our proposal. In addition, our CL-PDP protocol satisfies the following properties: unconditionally anonymous, privacy preservation, public verifiability, and reliability of the trusted third party. At last, an elaborate performance evaluation with other related schemes shows that this proposal is efficient and practical.

AB Blockchain the technology of the decade which has disrupted the complete technological sector and moreover has plotted its jurisdiction over almost all other industrial sectors with a significant coefficient. The credit industry in terms of credit cards and also the credit system of the financial supply chain management proves to be one of the competent use cases for the blockchain technology to be tendered upon. In the credit card-based system the structure terms to be quite complicated and also there are a lot of challenges in order to pass a credit fund to a particular customer and also there are huge processing and validation charges that are levied upon. Moreover, the financial organization which is responsible for dedicating a card to the user for smooth processing of the credit funds, also has to fulfil some tenacious check on the customers where the verification procedure lies into multiple segments to determine the pay term history, CIBIL Score and also the capability of the customer to pay out the credit funds. Also, in the financial supply chain management, the credit system is indeed one of the toughest systems to be managed as in Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM), the transactions are not in lower dimensions of few hundred thousand dollars rather are in millions and billions. Also, in the credit system of the FSCM, the credit exposure or the limit of a particular client is dynamic and the credit limit or exposure depends upon a wide variance of factors such as previous pay term history, average days past due, average term revenue, and revenue insurance. Moreover, the analysis and the validation of the capability of the customer to pay a certain amount is quite a time intensive and depends upon variables from numerous sectors. Therefore, a blockchain based environment may allow to assess the eligibility of a customer over the order limit or credit limit that have been demanded. Hence a blockchain based credit analysis framework can be very useful for gathering information about the customers from multiple financial sectors, analysis of the eligibility of the customer to stand the credit and to calculate the credit score of the customers based on the consensus of multiple stakeholders in the network including banks, insurance agencies and other third-party financial organizations

DE Blockchain; Bitcoin; Exchange; Transaction; Analysis
AB This bitcoin system is a system made to support transactions between users without the help of any financial institution. The Bitcoin Exchange is a service that enables exchanges of bitcoins mined by others with cash. To use this service, the miner should send bitcoins from his bitcoin wallet to the deposit address provided by the Exchange. The bitcoins delivered to the deposit address are automatically moved to one of the Exchange's bitcoin addresses by the Exchange system. Since what is known to the user is only the deposit address for the user, the user can only guess that the Exchange has taken the bitcoins from his deposit address when he/she sees the transfer of his/her bitcoins to another address. We will present a method to find out a few bitcoin addresses through preliminary work and find out the associated Exchange addresses using the characteristics of the deposit addresses and system addresses of the Exchange through transactions with the relevant addresses on the blockchain.

AB With the widespread of Bitcoin, blockchain has been focused by researchers from many fields, such as digital cryptocurrencies, finance security exchange, decentralized trade platform and so on. However, the operation efficiency (about 10min/per block) has limited its practical application except of Bitcoin. In this paper, we conduct further research based on the existing hybrid blockchain architectures, say N + X Hybrid Blockchain, which may significantly improve blockchain efficiency with the negligible cost of security. Moreover, we gave an evaluation model for the feedback process of nodes in the N+X Hybrid Blockchain and obtained optimal strategies. For the application of Energy Internet (EI), we proposed a scheduling mechanism based on the above evaluation model, and given an algorithm to implement it.

AB In this paper, we discuss the subnetwork structure of the Blockchain system, which is expected to develop various application platforms in the future. Blockchain is an innovative trading system, and many studies have been conducted recently. It is expected to be used in various fields with stable security function of each node taking part in the system without central server control. However, due to its three functional limitations (excessive traffic generation, lack of distributed control, and unfairness of network resources) presented in this paper, it is difficult to provide complete service in the present network. In order to minimize such problems, a subnetwork structure providing a Blockchain service should provide an appropriate network configuration according to a Blockchain application or service type. In addition, based on the number of the node participated in Blockchain and the amount of data transmitted, it is necessary to provide appropriate QoS and the subnetwork should provide stable protocol function and efficient traffic operation. This subnetwork structure is proposed as a service function of the future network structure of ISO / IEC JTC1 SC6 which is being standardized.

AB In the current era, blockchain based system getting a lot of attention across different industries especially in the domain of supply chain because of its streamlined nature at the same time keep the privacy intact as well as more efficient than the conventional system. However the traditional supply chain faced lot of challenges these days because of the complex networks. Blockchain integrated with IoT framework has the potential to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional systems across industries. Basically the IoT integrated blockchain system provides enough benefits such as connecting the link between the flows in the supply chain to improve the efficiency of the supply chain network, makes the system transparent that can reduce the code of conduct violation throughout the supply chain networks, the immutable properties helps the stakeholders to trace the products throughout the networks. Even though blockchain based system provides enough benefits across industries, so far the implementation rate is very low because of the lack of knowledge about the benefits of blockchain system as well as lack of understanding about how and why it is needed in their fields. In this paper we will highlight the difference between the conventional supply chain as well as blockchain based supply chain and the benefits of implementing blockchain in different sectors such as automotive, pharmaceutical, food industry, retail. This article will highlights the problems currently facing by the above mentioned industries by using the conventional supply chain as well as the solutions to the problems provide the blockchain based systems in those industries. This articles helps the people across sectors to understand the benefits of the blockchain based system in their respect fields as well as implement it to improve the efficiency of the overall system.

AB Following the recent increase in smart factories and smart cities and the fourth industrial revolution, the number of IoT devices has been increasing and accordingly, the security of IoT devices has also become an important issue. However, due to reasons such as the low performance of IoT devices, the currently existing security solutions can be hardly applied and even if safe firmware is supplied, security problems may arise due to attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and roll-back attacks. To resolve such problems, we propose a new firmware management architecture using blockchains and IPFS (The InterPlanetary File System). Using IPFS can ensure the integrity of the firmware. However, IoT device version management and IPFS URL integrity cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, IoT devices are enabled to be provided with firmware information and updated through blockchian networks to ensure the integrity of the IPFS URL, and an IoT devices management function is provided. The proposed system enables safe firmware distribution and update, and IoT devices' security level is expected to be higher. Through the proposed system, safe firmware distribution and update will become possible and IoT device security levels are expected to be enhanced.

AB Emergency service call for public service providers has become an important role for smart home applications in order to support safety and security in the household building. Blockchain has been a promising solution with cryptography and incentive distributed mechanisms to support the verification, execution and recording of transactions between untrusted parties. In this paper, we present a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum with smart contract infrastructure for handling an emergency service sending from SHS to Home Service Providers (HSP) when there are unusual environmental conditions. Our SHS testbed consists of three domains: (1) Smart Home Sensor Manager (SM) or IoT devices to gather environmental sensor data and send an emergency call to HSP, (2) Home Service Provider (HSP) system deployed with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and smart contract, and (3) decentralize Meteor framework to interface between Ethereum and web based applications for homeowners (HO) and HSP staffs. To achieve homeowner privacy and security, we enable digital signature coupling with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for handling the emergency call from SM to HSP and One Time Passcode (OTP) produced by HSP for HSP staffs to verify themselves for further access control when they go to service homeowner's house. Each smart contract transaction in solidity is described. Finally, security and privacy issues for our proposed work are discussed.

DE blockchain; smart contract; subscription payment; cloudservice
AB The payment of a subscription-based model for the cloud service is regularly operated with the association of the bank as a centralized trustful third party. This system taxes the parties involved by requiring them to pay high transaction costs to the bank. In this paper, we propose a protocol to enable Fixed Subscription and Pay As You Go Subscription payments in the cloud service without the use of the third party. We achieve this goal by decentralizing the payment with blockchain. In return, this decentralized system generates low transaction costs. We implement our idea in the form of two smart contracts in Ethereum network. We also evaluate the security properties of our protocol. Based on the performance analysis, we can argue that all of the operations in the smart contract produces reasonable gas costs and the contracts are usable in the real network.

   Privacy
AB Blockchain, the technology of the future neutrally facilitated the financial transactions in cryptocurrencies by strictly eliminating the need for a governing authority or a management that was required to authorize the transactions based on trust and transparency. The Blockchain Network also follows the principle of absolute privacy and anonymity on the identification of the users associated in a transaction. Since the time of its inception, the Blockchain Technology has undergone research that has demonstrated some various kinds of methods to sort out the access control system of the conventional system. In recent years Blockchain has also shown optimum reliability in multiple sectors such as Smart Home, Healthcare, Banking, Information Storage Management, Security and etc. This work in terms is further concerned to the sector of Smart Healthcare, which has grown to a much affluence regarding the efficient technique of serving and dictating medical health care to the patients with the point of maintaining privacy of the patients' data and also the process of laying out real time accurate and trusted data to the medical practitioners. But in the scenario of Smart Healthcare, the primary concern arises in the fact of Privacy and Security of the data of the patients due to the interoperability of multiple stakeholders in the process. Also, there has been a fact of determining accurate and proper data to the doctors if the concerned subject is out of reach from the in hand medical service. Therefore, this Concern of privacy and also mitigation of the accurate data has been very much managed in the work by regulating, a monitoring and sensing paradigm with accordance to the IOT and the Blockchain as a transaction and access management system and also an appropriate medium for laying out accurate and trusted data for serving with deliberate medical care and benefits to the patients across.

AB The current online test service only focused on convenience, but did not offer a solution to securing reliability. Also current online test service, which are centralized server storage and management methods, will not be able to maintain such systems in the event of SoF(Single-point of Failure) or physical problems. In this paper, we discuss online test and management system using private blockchain and CPABE(Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, create an 'Access tree' based on the user attribute to encrypt the information) algorithm. In the system, the private blockchain network is constructed with the nodes of the system manager, examiners, and examinees, and each node has different authority. Since the data encrypted by the CP-ABE algorithm cannot be decrypted without the corresponding attribute, it is impossible to read or modify the data.

AB The concept of smart grid infrastructure is already being implemented and progressing rapidly. The number of countries are transforming the traditional power grid so that it will be able to maintain the smart grid requirements. Smart grid is known as an evolutionary power grid which is proposed to make intelligent decisions on its own based on a current state of electrical power system. Microgrid (MG) is a "building block" of smart grid which supposed to provide wider control capability into the system, thus allowing to operate without connection to the grid. However, the remote and autonomous control of the smart grid may result in problems related to security. The main purpose of this paper is to consider various application scenarios of the Blockchain technology in smart grid. The utmost example is smart contract feature. It allows to reduce cost and increase security of trading operations without including third parties. In other words, direct communication between seller and consumer is implemented. Particularly, paper explain how the security and resilience of the system can be improved by the application of Blockchain technology. Furthermore, decentralized machine-to-machine interaction scheme is proposed. First of all, auction based electricity trading platform is established in Jade platform, and further on electricity trading history is stored in blockchain. The proposed case study shows implementation possibility of smart contracts in smart grid environment.

AB A Smart Contract is self-executable and self-enforceable program code that runs on the top of blockchain to manage complex business logic. It eliminates the need of extrinsic enforcement of legal agreements. Furthermore, it enforces the terms and conditions of an agreement that lies between untrustworthy parties in which the trusted third parties cannot interfere. The cryptography logic used in smart contract enables the blockchain network to provide trust and authority to all parties in transaction. Network decentralization, data immutability and transparency, resiliency and security make blockchain technology more versatile. Recently, it has become a potential quality and capability of IoT to connect uncountable electronic objects or devices at the same time. The most prominent feature of blockchain-based IoT applications is the integration of smart contracts between blockchain and IoT.
   A brief comparison has been given in the paper that how the smart contracts react on multiple blockchain platforms with respect to scalability, system complexity and consensus protocol factors. Furthermore, the context of Smart contract integration between blockchain and IoT with highlighting the integration opportunities and challenges along with future research directions. Therefore, we have concluded in the current paper that amalgamation of Blockchain with IoT through Smart Contract can provide a strong framework for distributed application and the newly introduced business communities.

AB In a decentralized vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy trading among electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need of a highly secure and privacy protected transaction environment. With the advent of digital currencies like Bitcoin, most of the blockchain applications incorporate a similar cryptocurrency system for secure processing. In this work, we propose a permissioned blockchain based energy trading among EVs to enhance security and privacy of the EV user's information. We introduce, a new cryptocurrency "ETcoin" for energy trading among EVs. All the matched bids comprises of traded energy unit and ETcoins transferred are stored in blockchain. The transaction graph formed by energy trade can be analyzed as a large scale graph processing using Big Data analytics. Existing works have not addressed blockchain analytics for processing large transaction graphs of energy trading. All the blockchain transactions submitted in a pre-defined period are considered for analytics. We propose an EnergyTradeRank (ETR) algorithm for Blockchain analytics of the large scale transaction graphs. ETR algorithm inherently applies the weighted ranking approach, which considers both the edge as well as vertex properites of graph to calculate the ETR Score for each EV during a traded period. Transaction graph analytics on energy trading acts as a proof-of-activity and it also help in incentivizing the EVs with maximum satisfiable participation in the blockchain environment. We implemented the blockchain based proof-of-concept (POC) using IBMs hyperledger fabric and composer with minimum transaction latency and in-time modeling of each participant to the system. Transaction graph analytics is implemented via an open source Apache Spark's GraphX library for a realtime distributed dataflow processing. Transactions are modelled as edge triplets on several machines and ETR score for every vertex is computed parallelly to converge at a set tolerance value. Simulated results show that the algorithm converges faster and scales better as the number of parallel machines increases. We also analyzed that the overall incentive gain for EVs with maximum, truthful and committed participation increases and thus promotes active participation in the system.

ID SCHEME
AB Wireless sensor networks are an easy target for report fabrication attacks, where compromised sensor nodes can be used by an adversary to flood the network with bogus/false reports. En-route filtering is a mechanism where intermediate forwarding nodes identify and drop false reports while they are being forwarded towards the sink. Existing en-route filtering schemes either have high storage overhead or low filtering efficiency. In this article, we propose a blockchain based deterministic en-route filtering scheme, capable of dropping false reports efficiently. Further, the proposed scheme does not require any key exchange between sensor nodes for data endorsement/authentication, thus reducing the associated key storage overhead and communication overhead. Finally, the proposed scheme can also adapt to dynamic networks and mobile sinks making it suitable for modern wireless sensor networks.

   Image Sharing Marketplace
AB In this paper, we aim to address the major problem of correct image attribution for photos being uploaded on the stock photo websites and peer-to-peer image sharing marketplaces, ensuring that original photographers are rightfully recognized and credited for their works. There are now millions of royalty-free images being shared every week on stock photo websites. There is a major discontent among photographers and graphics designers who share images on such websites regarding a widespread malpractice where others try to take credit for and benefit from original author's work. This happens when someone other than the original author uploads the same image as one already shared on the marketplace or uses image processing methods such as rotation, cropping, gray scale conversion etc and then uploads this tampered image to avoid copyright violation detection. To counter such problems, we propose a decentralised peer-to-peer photo sharing marketplace built on top of Ethereum test chain and demonstrate how it is fair, trustworthy and practical. Our decentralised application leverages perceptual hashes and robust smart contracts of Ethereum to automatically detect and reject tampered images that are perceptually similar to images already present on the marketplace. Due to inherent properties of Blockchain, our marketplace has no central authority controlling it, no third party interference, no single point of failure, zero-censorship and preserves online user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a practical solution for automatically detecting and rejecting perceptually similar images on a decentralised image sharing platform, thus protecting the copyrights of genuine image authors.

AB The consensus algorithm played a significant role in successful adoption of Blockchain technology. The security of bitcoin blockchain hugely depends on the complexity and reliability of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. However, a non-financial application, whose security requirements are less demanding, requires faster operation and so PoW is not suitable for many of the commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Trust-dependent Consensus scheme (TCON) for a blockchain based IoT access control framework. TCON ensures that the blocks are added at a faster rate, spending minimal energy compared to PoW based systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the notion of trust is quantified and used as a means to simplify the consensus problem in blockchain. A comparison of the various metrics to understand the differences in overhead involved suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms other non-trust-based consensus schemes.

DE Blockchain; Payment channels; Distributed; Zero-confirmation
   transactions
AB The main attraction of cryptocurrency is the decentralized, append-only public ledger blockchain that records the transactions. The current challenge of bitcoin blockchain is to increase the throughput. Two-party or multi-party payment channel using multi-signature address formed a connected payment network to solve the issue of scaling that fascinated bitcoin community. The micropayment channel solution implicitly assumes that parties will continue to interact for long intervals. This assumes a long-lived relation between buyer and seller. Another major disadvantage of forcing participants to lock funds for long intervals. The micropayment channel must know about the parties beforehand.
   We address this issue and present a protocol that offers freedom to do micropayment transaction with anyone as per the need without any prior knowledge about the parties. The protocol gives an alternate secured path for zero-confirmation transactions. From the test cases, we have shown that buyer will get quick services from sellers and honest sellers will not lose their funds share.

So, in this paper, we have developed smart contract architecture for Leave Management System using Solidity and Ethereum, which is a decentralized app architecture leveraged from Blockchain Technology. We also include smartphones as IoT devices by which any client can use this app. Due to the resource-constrained nature of these devices, the smart contract app is coupled with an alternative centralized architecture which is a classic client/server architecture with an underlying Blockchain backend.

AB The main issues with drug safety in the counterfeit medicine supply chain, are to do with how the drugs are initially manufactured. The traceability of right and active pharmaceutical ingredients during actual manufacture is a difficult process, so detecting drugs that do not contain the intended active ingredients can ultimately lead to end-consumer patient harm or even death. Blockchain's advanced features make it capable of providing a basis for complete traceability of drugs, from manufacturer to end consumer, and the ability to identify counterfeit-drug. This paper aims to address the issue of drug safety using Blockchain and encrypted QR(quick response) code security.

AB Food provenance is one of the most challenging problems that FSC companies face today. A global supply chain network with multiple operating procedures and asymmetrical food regulations between countries makes end-to-end food tracking incidental to the food industry. Blockchain empowers new kinds of distributed applications design. Initially, Blockchain technology has been embraced in electronic money, yet this tech is significantly more promising for different areas too. In this paper, we are getting to present Blockchain technology easily. Additionally, we are talking that Blockchain technological innovation is also utilized in the industrial process,from the retail industry to its advantage towards the client and additionally for that merchant to fantastic scope. During its heart, Blockchain is mainly thrilling because of the ability that it must empower increased confidence, transparency, and cooperation round constituencies which will otherwise battle to reach up to now better. As distribution chain sophistication rises, there is an apparent chance to induce efficiency as a result of higher cooperation and transparency in between various constituencies like manufacturing companies, vendors and delivery carriers, insurance, importers, wholesalers, and merchants. Being aware of in Real-time the specific supply, spot, and condition of most inventory while in the machine might be quite a game-changer for most organizations, notably those working in perishable or luxury-goods. Unlike present systems, that rely heavily upon every element to keep its clear and dispersed database significance restricted and frequently postponed penetration to the standing of products anyplace from the machine Blockchain eases real-time and dependable information sharing one of the components and may provide consensus regarding the actual condition of their machine into parties.

AB Blockchain technology along with Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing is expected to cause disruption in the existing business processes at unprecedented scale. Smart Contracts which represent business logic are consolidated by blockchain architecture. A smart contract is a self-executing program that may be triggered on events generated by IoT sensors, actuators or tags. Blockchain and smart contracts which find their optimum suitability in multiparty arrangements are anticipated to bring a paradigm shift in the domains of Supply-chain and logistics. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the disruptive innovation happening in the logistics processes due to blockchain, smart contracts and Internet of Things. We highlight the some of the most important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the logistics domain being positively affected due to this digital disruption and the required characteristics in the blockchain technologies for this paradigm shift to take place.

AB The first step in online shopping is, apparently, to choose a reliable supplier. However, consumers and merchants may have different perceptions of product quality, and this may result in business disputes. The dispute about buying inferior goods may be caused from simple product photos or merchants make over the top claims about their products. This dispute problem cannot be resolved completely, even though customers choose reputable e-commerce companies, e.g., Amazon. com and Alibaba. com. In the final analysis, the cause is that e-commerce companies do not adopt quality rating to evaluate products. If there is an alliance, among e-commerce companies and trusted organizations, which establishes credible product grading system PGS), online shoppers may buy genuine product at a fair price from this e-commerce alliance. In this paper, we propose blockchain based PGS BPGS) to deal with big data for this business model. The blockchain is a decentralized technology, and thus we can speed up the verification of product grading. In addition, for the proposed BPGS, 51% of attacks cannot be completed unless 51% of merchants and e-commerce companies in this alliance are simultaneously compromised. Therefore, our e-commerce environment based on BPGS is not only reliable but also secure.

AB Currently, storing patient's sensitive data by medical healthcare into Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has evolved immensely. Specifically, distributed healthcare records have brought ease to how hospitals and other different third parties access the sensitive medical health information of patients for various uses leading to generation of big data. Big data in healthcare is important as it can be used in the prediction of outcome of diseases, prevention of co-morbidities fatality and saving the cost of medical treatment. However, this has also made it easy for security breaches and privacy violations during the data collection process. In this paper, we propose a platform which uses the blockchain technology for privacy preservation during collection, management and distribution of EHR data. The aim of this paper is to ensure the total privacy, integrity and access control of distributed electronic health records to the data owners during its distribution on the blockchain. Simulated results demonstrate our proposed system establishes total transparency and ensures perfect privacy within the distributed network of sharing EHRs in the medical setting using the blockchain.

DE Blockchain; Cybersecurity; Node Scheduling
AB Recently, blockchain techniques have been widely used in finance, e-commerce and sharing economy, owing to its decentralization, openness and permission-less properties. In cybersecurity, a blockchain-based framework Sapiens Chain is proposed, which aims to provide decentralized and trustable cybersecurity services while protecting the privacy of the anonymous users. However, how to select an optimal service provider in Sapiens Chain remains challenging. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem of scheduling nodes in Sapiens Chain, which covers and rewards the nodes based on their performance with the history of providing cybersecurity services, and thus attracting more and more users to anticipate cybersecurity services. Under the scheduling algorithm, we propose to select nodes for different tasks by unifying the interest of each user, such as the bandwidth, the computing resource, and the activation degree. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

DE Blockchain; Privacy Preservation; Confidential Transaction
AB A blockchain is a technology that allows transactions to be processed and committed data to be shared among participants without a central server. To implement applications among restricted parties with permission such as asset sales and trades, a special type of blockchain system called a private blockchain is used. Additionally, the demand for privacy preservation where sensitive information such as the trade amounts and balances is not disclosed is increasing. However, privacy preservation in a typical blockchain setting is difficult because it prevents parties that are not involved in the transaction from checking the correctness of the transaction being processed, which may lead to unintended or invalid transactions. To address this issue, herein we propose a protocol that allows the consistency with regard to the transaction amount and the balance to be checked without disclosing their values. Specifically, we exploit a homomorphic encryption to encrypt the transaction amount and balance. Thus, the correctness of a transaction can be publicly verified by the parties using the zero-knowledge proof without a trusted third party.

AB Blockchain has attracted a broad range of interests from start-ups, enterprises and governments to build next generation applications in a decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy, configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.

AB Blockchain technology has become extremely popular, during the last decade, mainly due to the successful application in the cryptocurrency domain. Following the explosion of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are being deployed in almost every aspect of transactional operations as a means to safely exchange digital assets between non-trusted parties.
   At the heart of every blockchain deployment is the consensus protocol, which maintains the consistency of the blockchain upon satisfying incoming transactions. Although many consensus protocols have been recently introduced, the most prevalent is Proof-of-Work, which scales the blockchain globally by converting the consensus problem to a competition based on cryptographic hash functions; a process called "mining".
   The Proof-of-Work consensus protocol employs memory hard algorithms in order to counteract ASIC or FPGA mining that may compromise the decentralization and democratization of the blockchain. Unfortunately, this leads to increased power consumption and scalability challenges since numerous processing units such as GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, are required to satisfy the ever-increasing operational requirements of blockchain deployments.
   In this paper, we perform an in-depth performance analysis and characterization of the most common memory-hard PoW algorithms running on NVIDIA GPUs. Motivated by our experimental findings, we apply a series of optimizations on Ethash algorithm, the consensus protocol of the Ethereum blockchain. The implemented optimizations accelerate performance by 14% and improve energy efficiency by 10% when executing on three NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, the optimized Ethash algorithm outperformed its fastest commercial implementation.

AB Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Its notable characteristics of the distributed ledger, trustless system, and immutability not only makes it a disruptive innovation in the electronic payment industry but also potential solutions for other areas that require trust establishment. Electronic voting (E-voting) scheme is a use-case where all attributes of blockchain can offer a mechanism for an open, fair and universally verifiable electoral process. In this paper, we review the requirements and then propose Votereum, an E-voting system that utilizes the blockchain technology. The proposed system is empowered by Ethereum platform, including one server manages the entire system and the other handles all blockchain-related requests. The implementation is also deployed to Rinkeby testing network for evaluation on the feasibility and discussion on some security concerns, which are mentioned in the conclusion of this paper.

AB Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks rise in frequency, diversity, and intensity. Often, centralized defense approaches lack hard- and software capabilities. A cooperative, multi-domain DDoS mitigation system provides defense services on top of an existing, distributed infrastructure. However, participants in these systems lack incentives for cooperation and reputation. Thus, reward systems can fill this gap by providing necessary incentives for cooperation among service providers and consumers. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a reputation scheme for the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS). A smart contract-enabled process automates reputation management to diminish malicious behavior by incentive design. Among other metrics, Beta reputation provides intelligence to identify and reward honest participants.

   Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
AB The volume of traffic generated by modern Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks suggests that centralized defenses are not the most effective approach to counter these attacks. An alternative to reduce the burden of detection and mitigation is to combine centralized defense systems, creating a global and cooperative protection system. However, existing approaches suffer from the complexity of deployment and operation across different systems. Blockchains appear in this scenario as an alternative to simplify the exchange of information in a cooperative defense. This work evaluates in both local and global experimentations the performance of the blockchain system proposed in [8] concerning the latency to perform the signaling of blacklisted addresses.

AB Blockchain technology is developing at a rapid pace. For consumers that are only interested in simplifying processes and reducing costs by using a blockchain solution a new problem has occurred. It is not only necessary to select the appropriate solution, but also to configure and operate considering blockchain interoperability with different chains. For the industry, there is a need for solutions based on open standards. This paper proposes a Policy-based Blockchain Agnostic Framework that not only connects different blockchains but also facilitates their configuration and operation. Moreover, a case study is presented considering the cold-chain supply-chain, where each actor defines its policies based on blockchain requirements.

AB Blockchain protocols are based on a distributed database where stored data is guaranteed to be immutable. The requirement that all nodes have to maintain their own local copy of the database ensures security while consensus mechanisms help deciding which data gets added to the database and keep powerful adversaries from derailing the system. However, since the database that forms the foundation of a blockchain is a continuously growing list of blocks, scalability is an inherent problem of this technology. Some public blockchains need a few 100 GB to Terabytes of storage.
   In this work, we present the concept Superlight with self-contained proofs, which is designed to improve scalability of a public blockchain, while preserving security and decentralization. Instead of all nodes having a local copy of the whole blockchain to verify a transaction, nodes can derive the validity of a transaction by only using block headers. To keep the block headers compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a definition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof that is accepted by other nodes for transferring funds. The advantage of such a light-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the drawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures, limited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an interactive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a transaction.

AB Wi-Fi is widely used as an inexpensive way for terminal service access, which brings a trend of Wi-Fi sharing. However, the current Wi-Fi sharing mode has problems such as low reliability and high cost. In order to cope with these problems, this paper puts forward a decentralizedWi-Fi sharing mechanism based on blockchain, including three sub-mechanisms of Wi-Fi authentication, Wi-Fi sharing, and Wi-Fi usage charging. Specifically, Wi-Fi owners first authenticate their Wi-Fi information on the blockchain and only the authenticated Wi-Fi can be connected. Then, the Wi-Fi users pay for the Wi-Fi usage through the smart contracts. Finally, all transactions are registered on the blockchain to ensure the security and reliability of Wi-Fi sharing process. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism keeps a high Wi-Fi sharing success rate of more than 97 percent at a high Wi-Fi request rate of 200 tps.

AB Service Level Agreements (SLA) are documents that specify what Service Providers (SP) are delivering to customers. They contain information about the service, such as target performance level or monthly availability, and penalties for the violations of the SLA. The information about the penalties is essential because if the SP does not deliver what is defined, the customer must be compensated accordingly. However, the current compensation process is cumbersome and complex because of the amount of involved manual effort. To address this issue, it is proposed in this paper an approach based on blockchain and Smart Contracts (SC) to automate the compensation process while enabling dynamic payments during the SLA lifetime. The proposed approach was evaluated in an use case that simulates the management of a Quality of Service SLA between an SP and a customer. Based on the performed evaluation, parts of the SLA management process were successfully automated using a decentralized solution, and the payment of the compensation occurred without the intervention of a third party.

AB Blockchain technology has been developed for cryptocurrency systems. Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency type, guarantees a safe consensus using the Proof of Work (PoW) process. The PoW scheme is currently operating as a basic consensus algorithm for blockchain systems that are used widely in various industries. However, the PoW algorithm lacks in support of mathematical analysis, which hinders discoveries of potential weaknesses and flaws in the blockchain system. Therefore, in this paper, the correlation between the key parameters (i.e., TPS, difficulty, miners) in a blockchain system are analyzed based on mathematical analysis.

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; SECURITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Internet of things (IoT) is revolutionizing this world with its evolving applications in various aspects of life such as sensing, healthcare, remote monitoring, and so on. Android devices and applications are working hand to hand to realize dreams of the IoT. Recently, there is a rapid increase in threats and malware attacks on Android-based devices. Moreover, due to extensive exploitation of the Android platform in the IoT devices creates a task challenging of securing such kind of malware activities. This paper presents a novel framework that combines the advantages of both machine learning techniques and blockchain technology to improve the malware detection for Android IoT devices. The proposed technique is implemented using a sequential approach, which includes clustering, classification, and blockchain. Machine learning automatically extracts the malware information using clustering and classification technique and store the information into the blockchain. Thereby, all malware information stored in the blockchain history can be communicated through the network, and therefore any latest malware can be detected effectively. The implementation of the clustering technique includes calculation of weights for each feature set, the development of parametric study for optimization and simultaneously iterative reduction of unnecessary features having small weights. The classification algorithm is implemented to extract the various features of Android malware using naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, the naive Bayes classifier is based on decision trees for extracting more important features to provide classification and regression for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Finally, our proposed framework uses the permissioned blockchain to store authentic information of extracted features in a distributed malware database blocks to increase the run-time detection of malware with more speed and accuracy, and further to announce malware information for all users.

ID AGREEMENT
AB This paper studies the blockchain cryptographic tokens by means of mean-field-type game theory. It introduces the variance-aware utility function per decision-maker to capture the risk of cryptographic tokens associated with the uncertainties of technology adoption, network security, regulatory legislation, and market volatility. We establish a relationship between the network characteristics, token price, number of token holders, and token supply. Both in-chain diversification and cross-chain diversification among tokens are examined by using a mean-variance approach. The results suggest that the number of tokens in circulation needs to be adjusted in order to capture risk-awareness and self-regulatory behavior in blockchain token economics. The Sharpe and Modigliani ratios for cryptographic tokens are revisited.

AB This article departs from the post 2008 financial crisis context, from its intersection with technological developments, and from the socio-technical arrangements configured by this conjuncture. It explores plans and actions- of mainstream financial institutions, and of a community seeking for alternatives to centralised economy and governance- for the use of digital platforms supported by blockchain infrastructure. In particular, it explores how such plans and actions relate to conceptions of public and peer trust and how they appear to produce, or reinforce, reputational imaginaries and quantification practices within added value philosophies. By illuminating a tension between the two identified case examples, I seek to render alternative communities' and financial institutions' conceptions, imaginaries and practices (more) visible and to analyse their organisational marketing strategies- where there is a pragmatic and discursive operationalisation of technology as well as of trust as means to gain more self-sovereignty in action, while navigating markets and regulated actual world contexts.

AB This paper reviews the circumstances surrounding the launch of Venture Capital: An International Journal of Entrepreneurial Finance in 1999. It highlights a number of significant changes in the structure of the entrepreneurial finance market over the past 20 years, notably the decline of "classic" venture capital, the effective closure of the small-cap IPO market, the scale-up problem and the emergence of a second equity gap, the geographical dispersion of venture capital and the institutionalisation of the business angel market. A number of new players in the market - coinvestment schemes, equity crowdfunding platforms and blockchain technology-based Initial Coin Offerings - are discussed and the challenges and opportunities they pose for investors, entrepreneurs, policy makers, regulators and academic researchers are assessed. Against this background, a number of key features of the evolution of the content and focus of the Journal are discussed. The paper finishes with a summary of the papers included in this Special Issue.

DE Ethereum smart contract; test-suite generation; Pareto minimization
AB In Ethereum, many accounts and funds have been managed by smart contracts, thereby making them easy to be targeted. Due to the persistence characteristic of blockchain, revising a deployed smart contract is almost impossible. Both realities heighten the risks of managing funds and thus increase the demand for conducting sufficient testing to Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC). Different from the conventional software, ESC is a gas-driven program, where developers must charge gases for deploying and testing it. Therefore, it is important to provide a cost-effective yet representative test suite, where its representativeness can be typically measured by its branch coverage. In this paper, we deem the problem of ESC test generation as a Pareto minimization problem, and three objectives, minimizing (1) uncovered branch coverage, (2) time cost, and (3) gas cost are considered. Then, we propose a random based and an NSGA-II based multi-objective approach to seek cost-effective test-suites. Our empirical study on a set of smart contracts in eight of the most widely used Ethereum Decentralized Applications (DApps) verified that the proposed approaches could significantly reduce the gas cost as well as the time cost while retaining the ability to cover branches.

DE Blockchain security; Ethereum; EVM defending
AB Attacks on transactions of Ethereum could be dangerous because they could lead to a big loss of money. There are many tools detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts trying to avoid potential attacks. However, we found that there are still many missed vulnerabilities in contracts. Motivated by this, we propose a methodology to reinforce EVM to stop dangerous transactions in real time even when the smart contract contains vulnerabilities. Basically, the methodology consists of three steps: monitoring strategy definition, opcode-structure maintenance and EVM instrumentation. Monitoring strategy definition refers to the specific rule to test whether there is a dangerous operation during transaction execution. Opcode-structure maintenance is to maintain a structure to store the rule related opcodes and analyze it before an operation execution. EVM instrumentation inserts the monitoring strategy, interrupting mechanism and the opcode-structure operations in EVM source code. For evaluation, we implement EVM* on js-evm, a widely-used EVM platform written in javascript. We collect 10 contracts online with known bugs and use each contract to execute a dangerous transaction, all of them have been interrupted by our reinforced EVM*, while the original EVM permits all attack transactions. For the time overhead, the reinforced EVM* is slower than the original one by 20-30%, which is tolerable for the financial critical applications.

DE Smart Contract; Validation Tool; Blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric
AB Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, and it is the technology underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.

AB A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger that can record transactions between parties in a verifiable and permanent manner. Each node contains its ledger, and the contents of each ledger are maintained to be the same by a consensus algorithm. It is essential to ensure the safety and liveness of the consensus algorithms in blockchain platforms. The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is a consensus algorithm for the Stellar cryptocurrency using the blockchain, is utilized for the federated Byzantine agreement. The quorum configuration is one of the essential factors for ensuring the safety and liveness of the SCP; however, it has been rarely studied. In this study, we model the SCP with timed automata and verify the model using a model checking technique, with the purpose of investigating and evaluating the SCP. Through the modeling and verification of the SCP, we could check whether a certain quorum configuration ensures consensus or not, before execution on an actual network. We present several abstraction techniques that help in coping with the extremely large state space of the SCP model in formal verification. The proposed modeling and verification techniques can be utilized for other consensus protocols of various blockchain platforms using the Byzantine agreement.

ID MODEL
AB Blockchain technologies and smart contracts are becoming mainstream research fields in computer science and researchers are continuously investigating new frontiers for new applications. Likewise, microservices are getting more and more popular in the latest years thanks to their properties, that allow teams to slice existing information systems into small and independent services that can be developed independently by different teams.
   A symmetric paradigm applies to smart contracts as well, which represent well defined, usually isolated, executable programs, typically implementing simple and autonomous tasks with a well defined purpose, which can be assumed as services provided by the Contract. In this work we analyze a concrete case study where the microservices architecture environment is replicated and implemented through an equivalent set of smart contracts, showing for the first time the feasibility of implementing a microservices-based system with smart contracts and how the two innovative paradigms match together.
   Results show that it is possible to implement a simple microservices-based system with smart contracts maintaining the same set of functionalities and results. The result could be highly beneficial in contexts such as smart voting, where not only the data integrity is fundamental but also the source code executed must be trustable.

AB Driven by the surge of interest generated around blockchain technologies over the last years, a new category of systems, called Blockchain-Oriented Software (BOS), which are strictly tied to Blockchain distributed environment, has become increasingly popular. Yet, there is not a thorough understanding of their structure and behaviour and if and to which extent they differ from traditional software systems. The present work provide a first statistical characterisation of BOS. We analysed and compared 5 C++ open source Blockchain-Oriented and 5 Traditional Java software systems, aiming at detecting potential differences between the two categories of projects, and specifically in the statistical distribution of 10 software metrics. Although, in general, the statistical distributions for Traditional software and Blockchain software show similarities, the distribution of Average Cyclomatic and Ration Comment To Code metrics reveal significant differences in their queue, whereas the Number of Statements metric shows meaningful differences on the double Pareto distribution.

AB Blockchain-based crowdfunding is an emerging economic phenomenon and a state-of-the-art strategy to finance ventures. It bears similarity to conventional crowdfunding, but has its own unique characteristics. Therefore the success factors that affect the outcome of traditional crowdfunding may have a different impact on blockchain-based crowdfunding. Despite that the number of blockchain-based crowdfunding campaigns has increased drastically in the past few years, there is a lack of good understanding of what the success factors are for them in comparison to the ones for conventional crowdfunding. Such understanding is crucial for companies to design their blockchain-based fundraising initiatives properly and facilitate potential investors to seek main signals and drivers of outstanding projects. Furthermore it could help regulators and market participants to understand how the existing regulatory framework applies to blockchain-based crowdfunding. Due to specific characteristics of blockchain-based crowdfunding, regulatory frameworks may require potential re-interpretation of requirements to allow an effective application of regulations. To fill this knowledge gaps, we have reviewed a set of relevant literature on success factors for conventional and blockchain-based crowdfunding. The result of this literature review sheds light on the directions for future research and development. The contribution of our work is a better understanding of the distinctions and similarities of blockchain-based crowdfunding compared to traditional crowdfunding.

DE Tendermint; Blockchain; Security Practices; IBC
AB In this paper, we present Tendermint: a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) application-based blockchain. We show that Tendermint promotes another perception of blockchain programming. Unlike Ethereum which is a blockchain holding many applications, Tendermint proposes to have one application per blockchain. We discuss the idiosyncrasies of Tendermint and how it could, potentially, ease blockchain programming and improve performance. We finish by showing weaknesses of Tendermint, good practices to adopt to hinder security attacks when handling Tendermint nodes, and some potential adjustments in the IBC protocol - an interoperability protocol designed for Tendermint. Our goal is to introduce Tendermint by showing its main characteristics over traditional blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

AB With the increasing popularity of online shopping, privacy concerns in E-commerce are attracting more and more attention. Existing E-commerce models are trapped in a dilemma between the proof of ownership and privacy protection. To address this issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving business protocol by employing private smart contracts in the negotiation phase. The protocol allows counterparties make deals without the disclosure of private information such as identities, addresses, and phone numbers. Moreover, we employ the zero-knowledge proof to guarantee the ownership. To understand the feasibility for implementing the proposed model, we also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum Quorum and SERO.

ID DATA POSSESSION
AB With the widespread of cloud computing, the delegation of storage and computing is becoming a popular trend. Concerns on data integrity, security, user privacy as well as the correctness of execution are highlighted due to the untrusted remote data manipulation. Most of existing proposals solve the integrity checking and verifiable computation problems by challenge-response model, but are lack of scalability and reusability. Via blockchain, we achieve efficient and transparent public verifiable delegation for both storage and computing. Meanwhile, the smart contract provides API for request handling and secure data query. The security and privacy issues of data opening are settled by applying cryptographic algorithms all through the delegations. Additionally, any access to the outsourced data requires the owner's authentication, so that the dat transference and utilization are under control.

DE Supply chain visibility; IoT; Blockchain technology; Asset Management;
   Digitization; Integration
AB Supply chain networks are global, multi-modal platforms that are expected to facilitate seamless exchange of physical goods, information across multiple industries and enterprises and stakeholders. Current supply chain information systems are limited in term of providing validated, real-time asset specific business relevant information during its lifecycle. Only one or few stakeholders have information access privilege causing both information asymmetry and inefficiencies in the $35T global supply chain market. Emerging technologies such as IoT and Blockchain democratize "trustworthy" data availability and empower stakeholders to make the right decision at the right time in the most cost-effective manner. Digital supply chain integration is progressively becoming a competitive differentiation of enterprises. Organizations leading to this approach of digital supply chain are rapidly improving their asset utilization and enabling new data-based services. This paper presents the idea about relevance of complementary technologies like IoT and Blockchain technology for complete digitization of supply chain. The business case of pallet renting vendor is taken to showcase the use of technology integration to improve efficiency of its supply chain and asset management.

DE cybersecurity vulnerability assessment; cybersecurity framework;
   blockchain cybersecurity; cyber risk mitigation; criteria ranking
AB Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, and methodologies are used to understand the cybersecurity maturity of a system or a facility. However, these tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy; the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and software application called cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). CyFEr treats the problem at hand as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, which requires that various criteria be weighed relatively. Defining those weights is non-trivial and often leads to subjective decisions leading to undesired complications. To facilitate such a weighting system in CyFEr, we evaluated the application of various rank-weight methods (such as rank sum, reciprocal rank, rank exponent, and rank order centroid). The efficacy of those rank-weight methods was evaluated by applying them and testing against the blockchain cybersecurity framework (BC2F). BC2F was developed using the NIST cybersecurity framework to evaluate the cybersecurity posture of the blockchain nodes and networks in a given blockchain application or use-case.

DE Connected vehicles; Trust management; Blockchain; Smart Cities
AB Advancement in communication technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving smart cities adoption that aims to increase operational efficiency and improve the quality of services and citizen welfare. It is estimated that by 2020, 75% of cars shipped globally will be equipped with hardware to facilitate vehicle connectivity. The privacy, reliability and integrity of communication must be ensured so that actions can be accurate and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. Because vehicles are equipped with the ability to compute, communicate, and sense their environment, there is a concomitant critical need to create and maintain trust among network entities in the context of the network's dynamism, an issue that requires building and validating the trust between entities in a small amount of time before entities leave each other's range. In this work, we present a multi -tier scheme consisting of an authentication and trust building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB by adopting the vision of Industry 4.0, many industrial sectors are eyeing the potential for advancing their systems to achieve higher productivity, cost-effectiveness, reliability, quality, and flexibility. One important sector that can greatly benefit from adopting Industry 4.0 principles and technologies is the manufacturing industry. This will help create the smart manufacturing era where advanced technologies and systems in Industry 4.0 will enhance the different processes within the manufacturing value chain and increase efficiency and profitability. However, Industry 4.0 requires effective integration of many technologies and systems and seamless operations across all components. This creates many challenges when creating applications for smart manufacturing including security, trust, traceability, reliability, and agreement automation within the manufacturing value chain. Several of these challenges can be addressed using blockchain. This paper discusses how blockchain can support smart manufacturing applications in manufacturing. In addition, the paper proposes a middleware approach for utilizing blockchain services and capabilities to enable more secure, trustable, traceable, reliable, and autonomous smart manufacturing applications. This approach will offer many advantages to secure and establish good trust among involved parties in the manufacturing value chain. In addition, this will enable a verity of new applications to realize the promising benefits of Industry 4.0 for smart manufacturing.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger forming a distributed consensus on a history of transactions, and is the underlying technology for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. However, its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to increase transaction speed and scalability is to identify a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Preliminary results show improvement in the scalability of Proof of Work up to 34% compared to the current system.

AB Selfish mining is a well known vulnerability in blockchains exploited by miners to steal block rewards. In this paper, we explore a new form of selfish mining attack that guarantees high rewards with low cost. We show the feasibility of this attack facilitated by recent developments in blockchain technology opening new attack avenues. By outlining the limitations of existing countermeasures, we highlight a need for new defense strategies to counter this attack, and leverage key system parameters in blockchain applications to propose an algorithm that enforces fair mining. We use the expected transaction confirmation height and block publishing height to detect selfish mining behavior and develop a network-wide defense mechanism to disincentivize selfish miners. Our design involves a simple modifications to transactions' data structure in order to obtain a "truth state" used to catch the selfish miners and prevent honest miners from losing block rewards.

AB Over the last fifty years, medical treatment has seen remarkable advancement, however, the data management and storage systems of medical records has lagged in comparison. In addition, these systems are often inharmonious across platforms and do not put the privacy desires of patients first. While HIPAA and other laws are put in place to protect patient medical record security and privacy, these antiquated systems inherently hinder patient security and privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel data sharing and management scheme that empowers patients over their records by leveraging the security and privacy benefits of blockchain and smart contracts. In comparison to current methods for healthcare records management, our proposed scheme empower patients over their records and minimizes the dependencies on recordgenerating institutions. It also allows the patients to selectively share their records and disclose certain parts with specific data users based on the privacy preferences desired. In our security and privacy analysis, we show that patients can protect against potential threats to securely and privately share their records. Moreover, in our performance discussions, we show that smart contract design and development is key.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) promises technical solutions to many important societal problems relating to the environment, healthcare, transportation, etc. One approach to making IoT solutions more cost-effective is the idea of horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators are shared between different applications. In such environments, economic transactions between system components are used to pay for data and services. Blockchain-based overlay networks have been developed to provide such financial mechanism for IoT devices with sufficient processing power and operating system support. However, no practical solutions for low-end devices exist. In addition, existing solutions also require setting up multiple blockchain accounts for a single administrative domain, which incurs high fees when consolidating those accounts. In this paper, we propose a Ticket-Based Verification Protocol, which defines two separate logical entities, contract manager and transaction verifier. Our design limits the need for high-performance embedded systems to only one unit per administrative domain and reduces the processing and networking overhead other IoT devices in that domain.

AB MedRec is a simple, distributed system for personal control of identity and distribution of personal information. The work is done in the context of a medical information distribution system where patients retain control over who can access their data. We present a new architecture for the MedRec project, creating a network of trusted data repositories, the access to which are determined by a set of "smart contracts". These contracts are stored on a distributed ledger maintained by those who generate data. The distributed nature of the system allows unified access from diverse sources in a single application with no intermediary. This increases patient control while retaining a measure of privacy of both data content and source. MedRec is amenable to extensions for decentralized messaging and distribution of information to third parties such as medical researchers, healthcare proxies, and other institutions. The system is based on a blockchain that contains smart contracts defining user identity and distribution specifics.

AB The block chain technology is changing rapidly. The block chain guarantees the integrity of the book through a specific consensus of the participants. In the past, the block chain technology had a limited range of applications. However, the use of block chain technology is gradually expanding as smart contracts that can formulate general business logic are mentioned. Already studied the components of smart contracts in other studies and proposed the possibility of extending them on the basis of ontology. And research on securing traceability of smart contract based on ontology has been carried out. However, research on various transactions constituting smart contracts is lacking. In this paper, the constituent elements of smart contract are analyzed and expressed by ontology. And the process of negotiating the components is represented by each transaction. Finally, we construct the component represented by the ontology as XML by including the state information in the transaction. In this way, the smart contract is represented in a formal language that contains state information. It also laid the foundation for a smart contract that can be reused and verified.

AB Consensus is so important that it has always occupied its crucial position in human society. In particular, the meaning and importance of consensus in democratic society is much more special because it is a social system that operates based on the consensus among people. Up to now, human society has reached consensus by using the majority vote, but it is clear that there are several problems in it. Meanwhile, there are lots of researches which have been carried out so far to develop the appropriate methodology and tools for reaching out consensus. However, these researches suggest that measurement to derive the result is difficult for general purpose in that the evaluation is one-time, and that the trust problem arises from delegating the consensus process to the 3-rd party such as information system is not solved. In this paper, we propose an iterative consensus process which can solve the problems above, and general description about this process is included. The proposed process draws consensus in an iterative way, visualize the information generated from iteration, presents it to the participants, and supports the participants' consensus through structured discussion. In addition, the trust problem, which occurs when a consensus process is delegated to the information system can be solved with utilizing the blockchain technology by conveying and ensuring the reliability of the result, and this proposed process can adopt it.

   Lane Property Right Acquisition; Smart contract
AB Smart city blueprint is constructed by increasing deployment of various Internet of Things devices. In this paper, we focus on data transmission and request for lane property right under the domain of an intelligent traffic system. IoT devices are usually deployed in a heterogeneous environment, with the natural gene of decentralization. Compared with cloud-based centralized architecture, in this paper, we introduce blockchain as a decentralized technology to let vehicles jointly collaborate without having to go through a central computing node authority. Data transmission between vehicles uses a peer-to-peer network in which every node communicates directly with every other node, verified by their relevant end-point nodes; lane's acquisition right is approved by all relevant vehicle nodes, as well as with consensus agreed upon via smart contract.

AB The smart city is aiming for an intelligent connected society beyond the concept of U-City with simple ICT. In particular, the rapid development of information and communications, such as 5G, and blockchain, has led to a paradigm shift to a new digital urban environment. As smart energy and smart transportation are integrated or interlocked, the technical and institutional arrangement should be preceded from the time of user authentication to provide reliability, transparency, and efficiency. For this purpose, this study aims to investigate the technical and institutional plans for the implementation of safe urban life utilizing blockchain technology. In order to apply smart city services using blockchain technology, it is necessary to fully agree and practice among various stakeholders such as public, business, academia, and civic groups. It is expected to be implemented as a people-centered smart city by gradually applying the block chain-based pilot service, which is made and participated together.

AB In the digital healthcare era, it is of the utmost importance to harness medical information scattered across healthcare institutions to support in-depth data analysis and achieve personalized healthcare. However, the cyberinfrastructure boundaries of healthcare organizations and privacy leakage threats place obstacles on the sharing of medical records. Blockchain, as a public ledger characterized by its transparency, tamper-evidence, trustlessness, and decentralization, can help build a secure medical data exchange network. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art schemes on secure and privacy-preserving medical data sharing of the past decade with a focus on blockchain-based approaches. We classify them into permissionless blockchain-based approaches and permissioned blockchain-based approaches and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss potential research topics on blockchain-based medical data sharing.

AB The relative low level of smart home system (SHS) device information security may threaten the privacy of users. In this paper, we propose a homomorphic consortium blockchain for SHS sensitive data privacy preserving (HCB-SDPP), which is based on the traditional smart home system. We add verification services, which are composed of verification nodes, to our model to verify working nodes and transactions in SHS. In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model. If these nodes are insecure, the influence on the whole model will be analyzed. The simulation result shows that the HCB-SDPP model can protect customer privacy more effectively than SHS.

AB Purpose The world is witnessing the advent of a wide range of technologies like machine learning, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, cloud computing, Internet of Things and such others. Amidst this concoction of diverse technologies, the future of work is getting redefined. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand the future of work in the context of an emerging economy like India.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors undertook a qualitative research with a positivist approach. The authors undertook expert interviews with 26 respondents. The respondents were interviewed with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed for themes. System dynamics was applied to explicate the phenomenon studied.
   Findings The authors found that the future of work has multiple facets. The authors found that in future, organizations would not only use automation for lower end routine manual jobs, but also for moderate knowledge-centric tasks. Future jobs would have significant data dependency, and employees would be expected to analyze and synthesize data for sense making. Another finding pointed out that in future, individuals would be constantly required for skills upgradation and thus learning would become a continuous lifelong process. In future, individuals would get short-term tasks rather than long-term secured jobs. Thus, job flexibility would be high as freelancing would be a dominant way of work. Organizations would reduce dedicated workspaces and would use co-working spaces to reduce office space investments. In future, jobs that are impregnated with novelty and creativity would remain. A finding of concern was that with the advent of automated technologies a larger portion of workforce would lose jobs and there could be widespread unemployment that might lead to social unrest. The provision of universal basic income has been advocated by some experts to handle social crisis.
   Research limitations/implications This research is based on an organization centric view that is anchored in the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities. The research contributes to the conversation of human resource co-existence with automated technologies for organizations of tomorrow. Thus, this work specifically contributes to strategic human resource with technology capabilities in organizations.
   Practical implications These research findings would help organizational design and development practitioners to comprehend what kind of interventions would be required to be future ready to both accommodate technology and human resources. For policy makers, the results of this study would help them design policy interventions that could keep the nation's workforce job ready in the age of automated technologies through investments in automated technology education.
   Originality/value India is bestowed with one of the largest English-speaking, technically qualified young workforce working at lower salary levels than their developed county counterparts. The advent of automated technologies ushers in challenges and opportunities for this young qualified workforce to step into future. This is the first study from India that deliberates on the future of work in India.

AB The blockchain is currently under the spotlight of trending technologies. It adds security to private applications in several areas of knowledge, and its versatility results in the development of multiple frameworks to meet the requirements of each application. Thus, it is a key challenge to ensure that blockchain frameworks provide security, access control, and high performance to applications. In this paper, we evaluate two frameworks for blockchain development, Parity, and Multichain, which provide configuration and permission flexibility. Our evaluation is a comprehensive comparison between the frameworks, focusing on the analysis of transaction-validation time, transactionmining time, transaction-seek time and block-seek time. To this end, we deploy peer-to-peer private permissioned networks, in which the frameworks generate the blockchain applications. For each framework, we provide a realistic workload, based on the distribution of probability of interarrival time of transactions on the Bitcoin network. The results show that each framework stands out under specific criteria, and their design decisions imply restrictions on features that are critical for creating secure and efficient blockchain applications.

AB In this article, we highlight a novel solution for densifying 5G access networks. Taking benefits from local actors and prosumers, our proposal allows offering a better connectivity to end-users in a model involving network operators and a crowd of local actors. We show that building a multi-actors and densified access network infrastructure has become possible in a distributed way. Incumbent actors with a large footprint act as trusted partners securing the infrastructure and providing guarantees, while the crowd of local actors deploys multiple access points and are rewarded for their contribution. Rewarding is possible thanks to a distributed Bandwidth & Identity ledger along with a Proof of Bandwidth (PoB) mechanism. This article presents the main principles of this new connectivity platform, BALAdIN (Bandwidth Ledger AccountIng Networks), which relies on a consortium blockchain with access control mechanisms removing communitarian Wifi and ad hoc networks drawbacks. Indeed, combining distributed ledgers and edge networks allows local actors to cooperate with trusted parties, which leverages the full potential of multi-actors access networks.

AB A key characteristic of Smart Cities is the ability to improve decision making by combining the maximum possible information provided by sensors or people. This paper presents a Blockchain-based reputation system for allowing citizens to assess the quality of information shared by other participating citizens. Citizens have the possibility to confirm or refute information posted by others, and the reputation of participants has a role in the final credibility of the information shared. Individual reputation is used as a "currency", citizens bet with their reputation when giving an opinion, and get some reputation back when they are considered to be right. The reputation system is supervised by municipality stakeholders, which have the role of giving a final decision on the quality of the information and, consequently, in the update of the reputations associated with it. Stakeholders use Blockchain technology as a natural solution to spread their power regarding reputation management, ensuring a trustworthy dissemination of information, for instance, when reporting accidents.

AB This paper introduces the concept of using programmers as root of trust, for bare metal terminals, such as blockchain crypto terminals. When electronics devices are delivered through non trusted supply chains, there is a risk of malware injection. Bare metal architecture defeats these threats, but raises the issue of programmer integrity insurance. We propose to use innovative integrity probe software whose goal is to detect malicious bootloader thanks to which they are downloaded in the programmer memory.

AB Currently, blockchain data storage systems are considered promising for storing important information, including personal data. However, the requirements of modern legislation in various countries pose challenges to such systems, including the need to delete data at the request of users, which contradicts the very concept of the blockchain. One way to solve this problem is to use encryption. The paper presents the most powerful asymptotic estimates of the cardinality of sets of correlation-immune and (n,m,k)-resilient Boolean mappings that are used in the construction of stream encryption systems. Also, a recurrence relation is proved, allowing to calculate the number of (n,m,k)-resilient mappings for small values n, m and k.

AB The shared storage is essential in the decentralized system. A straightforward storage model with guaranteed privacy protection on the peer-to-peer network is a challenge in the blockchain technology. The decentralized storage system should provide the privacy for the parties since it contains numerous data that are sensitive and dangerous if misused by maliciously. In this paper, we present a model for shared storage on a blockchain network which allows the authorized parties to access the data on storage without having to reveal their identity. Ring signatures combined with several protocols are implemented to disguise the signer identity thereby the observer is unlikely to determine the identity of the parties. We apply our proposed scheme in the healthcare domain, namely, decentralized personal health information (PHI). In addition, we present a dilemma to improve performance in a decentralized system.

AB The article covers the issues of teaching public economic law in the context of digital technologies' development to the masters studying at the Institute of Law, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University). The theme's relevance is due to the transformation of institutions that form the sphere of regulation of public economic law within digital technologies' development, including blockchain technology, and the consequent need to elaborate new master's programs in the field of law. The purpose of this work is to formulate the concept, develop the structure and set the tasks of an interdisciplinary educational course for masters in the English language: "Public economic law within digital technologies' development". The object of the research is the global process of legal institutions' transformation that form the sphere of public economic law caused by the influence of new digital technologies' development, as well as the possibility of comprehensive study, reflection and integration of these processes with the use of authentic research material within the ambit of the relevant master's programs in jurisprudence in the English language. The analysis of the survey and questioning of students showed the coincidence of their needs with the demands of modern reality and employers. As a result, the main themes of studying courses, some professional terms and terminological units, models of communication, and cases were chosen on the basis of which professionally directed English-language competences are formed and the skills of intercultural interaction in the named sphere are developed. It is resumed that the study and acquisition of the content of the proposed course "Public economic law within digital technologies' development" allow masters to gain knowledge and form key competencies indispensable for the successful professionally directed English-language interaction of RUDN University's graduates in the field of public legal regulation of economic relations. The results of this study can be useful and applied by law faculties and universities' academic staff.

AB The energy market is entering the transitional period, and various types of energy markets such as solar energy will be formed beyond oil and gas. Correspondingly, energy prosumers that individuals and institutions produce and trade surplus electricity will become more widespread. Using the block chain, it guarantees the immutability and transparency of energy transactions, generates ERC20 tokens based on smart contracts, and transactions are automatically executed without third party intervention and can be extended to various transaction conditions. In the transaction, the energy is transferred using the Energy Storage System(ESS) which the seller and the buyer belong, and payment is made by transferring the token through a transaction. Based on this information, this paper suggests proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that can freely trade the produced energy.

AB In the present paper, an extension of the Bitcoin (BTC) structure is introduced, with a proprietary and unique DLCC (Digital Learning Chain Structure) blockchain, through which an automated bursary payment system could be constituted, which has, until this day, never been implemented at universities. Thus, an alternative is offered to achieve a bursary payment system, operating in a fully automatic, periodically repeating manner, never requiring supervision. In the DLCC blockchain, specifically, in the Smart Contract, the terms of contract are kept, concerning the bursaries, terms agreed by both parties (students and universities alike). A great advantage of the DLCC system is that it is able to extract the required grades from the electronic grade book, thus supervising the students' progress throughout the semesters. Upon reaching the end of each semester, if the student qualifies, meeting the requirements, the system will transfer the required quantity of cryptocurrency from the university's account automatically to the student's account.

AB The international experience of various countries of the world in the implementation, usage, and economic and legal status of cryptocurrency is compared in this research. The advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrency at the present stage of economic and scientific-technical development of Ukraine are considered. The results of the research of the awareness of market participants regarding the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency and the presence of interest in the usage of cryptocurrency are given. The aim of this article is to study the possibilities of using cryptocurrency for economic development. The object of the research is the process of using cryptocurrency in the market in Ukraine, taking into account world experience. Practical implications. The results of a study of the demand for cryptocurrency in Ukraine. The research was conducted with the help of a questionnaire, as a result of which it was found out: the level of awareness of cryptocurrency; subjective perception of cryptocurrency; sources of awareness of cryptocurrency; the presence of the potential interest of Ukrainians in the acquisition of cryptocurrency. It was found what exactly Ukrainians consider the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency. Value/originality. Cryptocurrency as a means of payment and a type of electronic money is found in the most countries of the world in the "grey" zone, and regulators, if not prohibit, then at least do not recommend citizens to invest in such assets. However, the state of science and technology development of blockchain technologies, which are the basis of cryptocurrency, and the state of demand for cryptocurrency in the Ukrainian market are ready to use cryptocurrency. For the effective implementation of cryptocurrency, Ukraine lacks only the normative framework. Developing a regulatory framework in this area will help to bring cryptocurrency markets to stability. The introduction of international experience in the usage of cryptocurrency in Ukraine, the creation of own model of behaviour will be the first step towards building a transparent and understandable cryptocurrency market, which will lead to the development of the economy as a whole.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB Supply chain management enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions integrate special tags (e.g., RFID, NFC, and QR-codes) with products to create Smart Tags, in addition to storing supplemental information about a product, which is also used to track products during their lifecycle. However, a product consumer has to implicitly trust the Smart Tag creator and other stakeholders within the supply chain that they are providing authentic data within a product's tag. The DL-Tags solution steps into this environment to offer a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable management of Smart Tags during a product's lifecycle. The solution is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and uses the Ethereum blockchain to mediate interactions between the stakeholders during a product's exchange process. By reaching a consensus on the product's description and state logged on the blockchain, all involved stakeholders and product consumers can verify the product's authenticity without revealing their identity. The paper describes the DL-Tags solution and includes a cost analysis of all implemented transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The proposed solution provides evidence of the product's origin and its journey across the supply chain while preventing tag duplication and manipulation. It is among the first documented practical solutions using DLT and IoT for supply chain management, which is designed to be distributed ledger agnostic.

AB The modern intelligent transportation system brings not only new opportunities for vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) services but also new challenges for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Apart from enhanced network performance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle the trust management while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control. Hence, real-time IoT services on transportation monitoring and reporting can be well supported. Both pave the way for an innovative vehicular security scheme. This paper investigates the security and privacy issue in the transportation system and the vehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to the decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based security framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e., real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages. This paper explicitly illustrates the SDN-enabled 5G-VANET model and the scheduling procedures of the blockchain-based framework. The numerical simulation results also show that malicious vehicular nodes or messages can be well detected while the overhead and impact on the network performance are acceptable for large-scale scenarios. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our design substantially guarantees a secure and trustworthy vehicular IoT environment with user privacy preserved.

TI Nodes in the Bitcoin Network: Comparative Measurement Study and Survey

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant attention and growth in recent years. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called "volunteers" are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013 similar to 2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days. In addition, based on the observations made from the measurement study, we propose a simple distance-based peer selection rule for improved connectivity and faster data propagation. The evaluation results show that our proposed lightweight and backward-compatible peer selection rule has the potential to reduce data dissemination latency.

TI Data Security Sharing and Storage Based on a Consortium Blockchain in a

AB A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) can improve the flow of traffic to facilitate intelligent transportation and to provide convenient information services, where the goal is to provide self-organizing data transmission capabilities for vehicles on the road to enable applications, such as assisted vehicle driving and safety warnings. VANETs are affected by issues such as identity validity and message reliability when vehicle nodes share data with other nodes. The method used to allow the vehicle nodes to upload sensor data to a trusted center for storage is susceptible to security risks, such as malicious tampering and data leakage. To address these security challenges, we propose a data security sharing and storage system based on the consortium blockchain (DSSCB). This digital signature technique based on the nature of bilinear pairing for elliptic curves is used to ensure the reliability and integrity when transmitting data to a node. The emerging consortium blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, and reliable database, which is maintained by the entire network node. In DSSCB, smart contracts are used to limit the triggering conditions for preselected nodes when transmitting and storing data and for allocating data coins to vehicles that participate in the contribution of data. The security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrated that our DSSCB solution is more secure and reliable in terms of data sharing and storage. Compared with the traditional blockchain system, the time required to confirm the data block was reduced by nearly six times and the transmission efficiency was improved by 83.33%.

AB Blockchain is experiencing rapid development and has the full potential of revolutionizing the IoT platform in the industrial field. In this paper, a light-weighted Blockchain-based platform for IIoT is presented to address security, trust, and island connection problem in the process of IIoT ecosystem construction. BPIIoT is comprised of the on-chain network and the off-chain network. All transactions are processed in the on-chain network such as including digital signature based on access control and programmable permission. The off-chain network deals with the storage, complex data processing, and other problems that blockchain cannot solve. The smart contract is utilized as the service contract of consumers and manufacture resources, providing on-demand manufacturing service. Two smart application cases, manufacturing equipment data sharing and maintenance service sharing from smart manufacturing, are implemented to explain the smart contract for equipment maintenance service and status data sharing service throughout maintenance, repair, and operation service network by the BPIIoT.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting things to the Internet in a peer-to-peer paradigm for data collecting and data sharing in our daily life. A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain.

AB The digital competence is necessary for 21st century living, but from several countries survey, a large number of people still have insufficient digital competence. Moreover, from literature study found three problems of today cooperative education information system, (1) lack of information sharing among university community, (2) lack of connect information to public, and (3) lack of enhancing 21st century learning skill. This paper proposes a process design of cooperative education management system by using the integration of cooperative education, E-Portfolio, digital competence framework 2.0, cloud computing technology, and blockchain technology. These processes make result of digital competence assessment credible and share to open digital labor market finally.

AB A Blockchain Technology (BCT) is an emergent digital technology that in recent years has gained widespread traction in various industrial, public, and business sectors; primarily in financial and banking realms owing to the rapid increase of cryptocurrency valuation in recent years. A blockchain Technology (BCT) is, in essence, a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. It was introduced as the working mechanism that formed the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain extensive mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. It was evident that the underlying principles characteristic of BCT functional attributes and secure digital infrastructure could find application in nearly any conceivable industry. BCT aims at creating a system that would be a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring and cyber-resilient system that assures the facilitation and protection of truly efficient data exchange system.
   This research depicts a survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and examines the potential incorporation within the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process. Furthermore, the paper investigates how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM workflow by emphasizing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The focus on collaboration and the distributed nature of both technologies imply the suitability for implementing an integrative framework, and in extension, posit that effectively leveraging DLT's robust, reliable, and secure network infrastructure, and BIM workflow processes can be significantly enhanced. The paper examines the fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their prospective future applications and current advances, and their categorization based on intrinsic characteristics of consensus reaching and permissions. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the design review process such as using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. HLF is the underlying BCT infrastructure that can serve to highlight key postulations to elucidate the idealized BIM workflow aptly.

AB With the advent of the era of big data, how to publish electronic data in a manner of credible become a challenge. Traditional data publishing schemes either require a trusted third party (TTP) that is responsible to collect and publish data, or cannot support similar data duplicate detection. The result is that they are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and suffer from an unnecessary waste of storage space. To address the above issue, in this paper, we propose a blockchainbased credible data publishing model (BCDP), which enjoys the properties of decentralized, tamper resistant and anti-DDoS attacks. Then, we construct a two-layer near duplicate detection algorithm with counting bloom filter (CBF) that can detect near duplicate data based on BCDP. In addition, we exploit an academic publishing system based on BCDP, which introduces an academic scoring mechanism to achieve reward and punishment for academic publishing.

AB Imaging studies are one of the leading drivers of modern medical decision making, and thus, their accessibility to healthcare providers and patients is of critical importance. However, current techniques for storage and transferring medical imaging data are inconvenient and sometimes wholly inadequate. In this paper, we propose a decentralized autonomous medical image processing approach using blockchain technology. Blockchain will enable the sharing of key relevant data using a distributed, decentralized, shared ledger that is available to participants. We outline a framework that utilizes blockchain to enable users to access imaging data in a secure and autonomous manner. A user case is experimentally investigated to validate our proposed approach.

AB Large-scale distributed systems are becoming more widespread and, at the same time, their sizes grow day by day. In this type of systems, the adoption of blockchains is gaining particular traction for data storage in a secure and distributed manner. Nevertheless, design and testing of new protocols and features face the challenge of determining whether the proposed modifications would actually improve the system as expected. In the case of existing cryptocurrency systems, building an evaluation platform poses additional difficulties due to the resource-consuming nature of the associated processes.
   In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that relies on container-based network emulation to create scalable local testbeds in which Proof-of-Work-based blockchain systems can be evaluated. Using one of the mainstream Ethereum clients, we replaced the mining algorithm with a simulation model built upon the statistical characteristics of the mining process and instrumented the client to capture relevant network events. These events are used to create an offline reconstruction of the global view of the blockchain and all forking events, and to completely characterize the working conditions under arbitrary setups.
   Based on the versatility and scalability of our platform, we are able to test several network scenarios of increasing size in which we analyze the incidence of the target time in the generation of contradictory views of the blockchain (i.e. forks). We show that even using a limited testbed constituted by just commodity hardware, it is possible to use our platform to study the dynamics of blockchain-based systems up to hundreds of nodes.

ID CORRECTNESS
AB Blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in blocks through user defined scripts known as smart contracts. Normally, a block of the chain consists of multiple transactions of smart contracts which are added by a miner. To append a correct block into the blockchain, miners execute these transactions of smart contracts sequentially. Later the validators serially re-execute the smart contract transactions of the block. If the validators agree with the final state of the block as recorded by the miner, then the block is said to be validated. It is then added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol. In Ethereum and other blockchains that support cryptocurrencies, a miner gets an incentive every time such a valid block successfully added to the blockchain.
   In most of the current day blockchain the miners and validators execute the smart contract transactions serially. In the current era of multi-core processors, by employing the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators fail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By adding concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this paper, we develop an efficient framework to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs).
   Miners execute smart contract trans lions concurrently using multi-threading to generate the final state of blockchain. STM is used to take care of synchronizationissues among the transactions and ensure atomicity. Now when the validators also execute the transactions (as a part of validation) concurrently using multi-threading, then the validators may get a different final state depending on the order of execution of conflicting transactions. To avoid this, the miners also generate a block graph of the transactions during the concurrent execution and store it ill the block. This graph captures the conflict relations among the transactions and is generated concurrently as the transactions are executed by different threads. The miner proposes a block which consists of set of transactions, block graph, hash of the previous block, and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, the validators re-execute the same smart contract transactions concurrently and deterministically with the help of block graph given by the miner to verify the final state. If the validation is successful then proposed block appended into the blockchain and miner gets incentive otherwise discard the proposed block.
   We execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering (BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering (MVTO) protocols as optimistic STMs. BTO and MVTO miner achieves 3.6x and 3.7x average speedups over serial miner respectively. Along with, BTO and MVTO validator outperform average 40.8x and 47.1x than serial validator respectively.

AB Contemporary software deployments rely on cloud-based package managers for installation, where existing packages are installed on demand from remote code repositories. Usually frameworks or common utilities, packages increase the code reusability within the ecosystem, whilst keeping the code base small. However, disruptions in the package management services can potentially affect development and deployment workflows. Furthermore, cloud package managers have arguably an ambiguous ownership model and offer limited visibility of packages to the users. This work describes the development of a blockchain-based package control system which is decentralised, reliable, and transparent. Blockchain nodes are installed within the distributed infrastructure to provide immutability, and then a dependency graph is constructed with the help of smart contracts to trace the software provenance. Our system has been successfully tested with 4338 packages from NPM, 950 out of which are the top depended-upon packages.

AB There are various possible mechanisms for updating potentially vulnerable and exploitable software and firmware on Internet connected devices. Due to their well-known benefits, delta updates have become a common way of updating software. Recently, several authors proposed the use of blockchain technology to update software and firmware. While both delta updates and blockchain technology are now used in different areas, this paper studies the feasibility of combining the two technologies for firmware updates on resource constrained IoT devices such as Wi-Fi smart plugs and sensors. The paper identifies the scenarios where delta updates may not work and proposes a private blockchain network-based IoT device firmware integrity verification and update mechanism. The proposed private blockchain mechanism for integrity verification utilizes a tamper-proof blockchain server. The proposed solution aims to enhance firmware update performance.

AB Cryptocurrency is one of the emerging online currency of the modern era. Big companies are investing in this technology. However, some established companies still hesitate to use it. According to them, it is a volatile trend which will fade up eventually. There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business. These subtopics can help business experts to evolve their businesses' and to make them more sustainable on the basis of public perception.

AB The widespread use of sensorial technologies has created new opportunities for enterprises, as these new sources of data assist in increasing the context-awareness in which enterprises operate and enable them to better anticipate and adapt to changes in the business environment. This leads to better decision making and greater profitability, as well as to reduced operating risks. However, if enterprises are to get any benefit from these new data sources, there is a need for tools, which will enable them to deal with the complexity of the multitude of data sources, both from physical and virtual objects, as well as a means to extract relevant and correct information and knowledge from it. Having access to data is not enough. The real value to enterprises comes from being able to process it, interpret it and being able to make accurate forecasts upon which they can base their business decisions. This paper presents the blockchain technology which is intended to support the development of sensing enterprise systems for intelligent knowledge management. Since the creation of the internet, blockchain is the most important technology created that is in constant development and has still much more to develop. In a simple way, blockchain is a computational technology for register of operations, decentralized, free-access, transparent, global, continuous. It is a public database that is accessible for everyone and is much more secure and reliable than other forms currently known to perform similar operations. Thus, it is intended to demonstrate the importance of this recent technology in business processes and the future trends of its use in sensing enterprise business processes. The proposed framework intends to demonstrate and serve as the foundation for new business models supported by the new capabilities provided by sensorial technologies in the support of enterprise applications.

DE cryptocurrencies; blockchain; wallets
AB Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are the internal mechanism used in many cryptocurrencies to represent coins. Such representation has some clear benefits, but also entails some complexities that, if not properly handled, may leave the system in an inefficient state. Specifically, inefficiencies arise when wallets the software responsible for transferring coins between parties) do not manage UTXOs properly when performing payments. In this paper, we study three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, by analysing the state of their UTXO sets, that is, the status of their sets of spendable coins. These three cryptocurrencies are the top-3 UTXO-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Our analysis shows that the usage of each cryptocurrency presents some differences, and led to different results. Furthermore, it also points out that the management of the transactions has not always been performed efficiently and therefore, the current state of the UTXO sets is far from ideal.

AB Neural networks are widely used in the field of cognitive diagnosis. Cognitive diagnosis can diagnose the subjects' knowledge of cognitive attributes according to their responses, so as to obtain the specific cognitive status of the subjects and provide remedial measures. The studies on the convergence of cultural industry and tourism industry are emerging, but the theoretical system needs to be improved. The research on the convergence mechanism between cultural industry and tourism industry can complement each other on the basis of independent theoretical system, which establishes relationship between the two theoretical systems. Based on the adaptive neural network algorithm and from the perspective of blockchain, this study takes cultural industry and rural tourism industry as examples to diagnose the industry convergence of rural cultural industry and rural tourism industry development, which will further consolidate the theoretical basis for the convergence and development of tourism industry and cultural industry, as well as contribute to promoting development of industry convergence.

AB Advancement of consensus protocols in recent years has enabled distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to find its application and value in sectors beyond cryptocurrencies. Here we reviewed 66 known consensus protocols and classified them into philosophical and architectural categories, also providing a visual representation. As a case study, we focus on the public sector and highlighted potential protocols. We have also listed these protocols against basic features and sector preference in a tabular format to facilitate selection. We argue that no protocol is a silver bullet, therefore should be selected carefully, considering the sector requirements and environment.

AB The traditional food supervision system has problems such as lack of industry chain and data fragmentation, which has caused the phenomenon of field regulation to be uncomprehensive in the existing regulatory system and the disposal of response lag. Combining the characteristics of blockchain such as distribution, transparent, and collegiality with the actual needs of regional autonomy, we propose the hierarchical multi-domain blockchain (HMDBC) network structure and the secondary-check mechanism, which can support timely correction and replacement of the malicious supervision nodes by regional nodes co-governance, auxiliary verification of supervision nodes, and arbitration of superior regions. In order to optimize the supervision nodes election, we proposed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of credibility, which can be used to objectively and fairly evaluate the comprehensive reputation of each node in that region by considering various influencing factors of node performance indicators. Furthermore, we designed the data block structure model, which can support the supervisor node replacement. Our system can perform automatic food quality detection and warning of substandard food in the entire industrial chain, with the use of smart contracts combined with the food industry standards. Finally, comparing the complexity of the traditional blockchain system with PBFT consortium, our system is more secure, with lower broadcast complexity.

AB Edge computing is an important tool for smart computing, which brings convenience to data processing as well as security problems. In particular, the security of data storage under edge computing has become an obstacle to its widespread use. To solve the problem, the mechanism combing blockchain with regeneration coding is proposed to improve the security and reliability of stored data under edge computing. Our contribution is as follows. 1) According to the three-tier edge computing architecture and data security storage requirements, we proposed hybrid storage architecture and model specifically adapted to edge computing. 2) Making full use of the data storage advantages of edge network devices and cloud storage servers, we build a global blockchain in the cloud service layer and local blockchain is built on the terminals of the Internet of things. Moreover, the regeneration coding is utilized to further improve the reliability of data storage in blockchains. 3) Our scheme provides a mechanism for periodically validating hash values of data to ensure the integrity of data stored in global blockchain.

TI Analysis of Blockchain System With Token-Based Bookkeeping Method

DE Token-based; parallel-processing; specific-rollback; regulatory-friendly
AB We propose a token-based blockchain system that streamlines abstractions into a universal token structure. In the proposed system, each token has an identity that enables the implementation of specific rollbacks and governance that make 51% attacks unprofitable. Because the token-based bookkeeping method only verifies and updates the ownership within each transaction, the proposed system supports parallel expansion and cross-chain transactions without limit. The flexible authority management mechanism of the proposed system is regulatory-friendly, as the intensity of supervision and governance can be adapted to accommodate different application scenarios.

TI The VAT Treatment of Cryptocurrencies
SO EC TAX REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology will gain importance for the VAT (Value Added Tax) practice and for tax authorities in the future. The European legislator has not dealt with this issue comprehensively. In literature, the discussion regarding the VAT treatment of cryptocurrencies is still in its infancy. This article is therefore intended to illustrate the VAT treatment of cryptocurrencies. Among others, it analyses the exchange of cryptocurrencies, using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and the mining of cryptocurrencies.

TI A Survey on Blockchain: A Game Theoretical Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; game theory; mining management; security
ID EVOLUTIONARY GAME; BITCOIN; MARKETS
AB Over the past decade, blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The popularity of blockchains was originated from the concept of crypto-currencies to serve as a decentralized and tamper-proof transaction data ledger. Nowadays, blockchains as the key framework in the decentralized public data-ledger have been applied to a wide range of scenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as the Internet of Things, healthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on blockchain networks, where game theory emerges as an analytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical approaches applied in blockchain-related issues. In this survey, we review the game models proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network. The focus is placed on security issues, e.g., selfish mining, majority attack and denial of service attack, issues regarding mining management, e.g., computational power allocation, reward allocation, and pool selection, as well as issues regarding blockchain economic and energy trading. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these selected game theoretical models and solutions. Finally, we highlight important challenges and future research directions of applying game theoretical approaches to incentive mechanism design and the combination of blockchain with other technologies.

AB Blockchain is the promising technology of recent years, which has attracted remarkable attention in both academic studies and practical industrial applications. The smart contract is a programmable transaction that can perform a sophisticated task, execute automatically, and store on the blockchain. The smart contract is the key component of the blockchain, which has made blockchain a technology beyond the scope of the cryptocurrencies and applicable for a variety of applications such as healthcare, IoT, supply chain, digital identity, business process management, and more. Although in recent years the progress toward improving blockchain technology with the focus on the smart contract has been impressive, there is a lack of reviewing the smart contract topic. This paper systematically reviews the key concepts and proposes the direction of recent studies and developments regarding the smart contract. The research studies are presented in three main categories: 1) security methods and tools; 2) performance improvement approaches; and 3) decentralized applications based on smart contracts.

AB The paper discusses the special features of transformation of business institutions in the process of economic activity digitalization. Methodologically the research is premised on the theoretical concepts of evolutionary and neo-institutional theory, the concepts of the sharing and digital economy. The basic research method is a logical-structural analysis of theoretical and empirical data in the public domain. The study reveals socio-technological driving forces of the development of the digital economy: big data, cloud and blockchain technologies, digital platforms, the Internet of things, the concept of a smart city and the sharing economy. The author formulates the characteristics of economic activity digitalization: an increase in the share of services in total production, a growing decentralization of resources, a rise in the share of instant transactions, the use of cloud technologies, the development of the sharing economy and institutional support for business. The article lays down the principles of economic activity digitalization based on decentralization of resources that embrace expediency, usefulness and effectiveness of digitalization. The paper also identifies the principles of evolutionary development: uncertainty, formality and inevitability of digitalization. It looks at the transformation of business institutions in the process of economic activity digitalization, which lies in three processes: a significant reduction in life cycles of business institutions resulting from making rapid managerial decisions, as well as the increasing role and the shifting content of informal business institutions to the field of rational values and self-expression. The author demonstrates the application of socio-technological driving forces to manage a firm's resources. The use of blockchain technologies and big data is expedient to manage labour resources. Cloud technologies and crowdfunding are used to regulate financial resources. When managing the development of material resources, it is advisable to apply the Internet of things and the sharing economy. Information resources are organized through digital platforms. The research findings can be of use when mapping out strategies for the development of individual companies, sectoral markets and state management of economic sectors.

AB This paper describes the application of biometric-based cryptographic techniques to create secure electronic signatures on contract agreements of any kind or format. The described techniques couple password and biometric authentication factors to form a Biometric Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE) protocol. The protocol provides mutual authentication and multi-factor user authentication, and defeats phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. The operation of BAKE establishes a secure channel of communications between two parties. This channel provides confidentiality for the user's authentication credentials and the contract agreement the user intends to sign. By including an indication of the user's intention to conduct an electronic transaction and the user's acceptance of the terms of the included contract agreement, the described application complies with the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (UETA) and Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act requirements. The biometric electronic signature described in this paper is suitable for use in Cloud environments and in blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology smart contract applications.

TI Combating Deepfake Videos Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts

AB With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques, fake digital contents have proliferated in recent years. Fake footage, images, audios, and videos (known as deepfakes) can be a scary and dangerous phenomenon and can have the potential of altering the truth and eroding trust by giving false reality. Proof of authenticity (PoA) of digital media is critical to help eradicate the epidemic of forged content. Current solutions lack the ability to provide history tracking and provenance of digital media. In this paper, we provide a solution and a general framework using Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track the provenance and history of digital content to its original source even if the digital content is copied multiple times. The smart contract utilizes the hashes of the interplanetary file system (IPFS) used to store digital content and its metadata. Our solution focuses on video content, but the solution framework provided in this paper is generic enough and can be applied to any other form of digital content. Our solution relies on the principle that if the content can be credibly traced to a trusted or reputable source, the content can then be real and authentic. The full code of the smart contract has been made publicly available at Github.

DE Resource request; transaction; blockchain; social network; community
AB Currently, blockchain technology has been widely researched and is being applied to many other fields, such as financial transactions, E-government, logistics, and supply-chain system. It can be used to store and maintain transaction data through the de-centralized model. In this paper, we propose an autonomous resource request transaction framework based on blockchain in a social network, in which all kinds of resources in the social community can be traded through blockchain technology. When a user needs to acquire some resources from a community, the user may make a transaction with the members from the community through blockchain technology while the members autonomously negotiate each other to reach an agreement. The proposed framework provides an incentive mechanism to encourage community members to disseminate the resources through a smart contract.

AB Thanks to the rapid development in mobile vehicles and wireless technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an attractive application that can provide a large number of mobile services for drivers. Vehicles can be informed of the mobile position, direction, speed, and other real-time information of nearby vehicles to avoid traffic jams and accidents. However, the environments of IoV could be dangerous in the absence of security protections. Due to the openness and self-organization of IoV, there are enormous malicious attackers. To guarantee the safety of mobile services, we propose an effective decentralized authentication mechanism for IoV on the basis of the consensus algorithm of blockchain technology. The simulation under the veins framework is carried out to verify the feasibility of the scheme in reducing the selfish behavior and malicious attacks in IoV.

AB Originally conceived as a mechanism to enable a trustless cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, blockchain has since unbound itself from its original purpose as an increasing number of industries and stakeholders' eye the technology as an attractive alternative to solve existing business solutions as well as disrupt mature industries. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the blockchain technology, tracking its increase in popularity in relation to similar technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. The objective of this paper is to identify the current standing of the blockchain technology within the literature while also identifying the major fields of study and areas of application for which blockchain offers a valuable solution. This paper finds that unique features to the blockchain, such as privacy, security, anonymity, decentralization, and immutability, provide valuable benefits to various fields and subjects. This paper also finds that exploring the application of blockchain has only begun with some limited studies in areas, such as the Internet of Things, energy, finance, healthcare, and government, that also stand to benefit disproportionately from its implementation.

AB Task matching in crowdsourcing is designed to provide convenient task information retrieval and has been extensively explored. In general, the task matching process is required to be reliable and to meet privacy requirements. However, most existing privacy-preserving task matching solutions for crowdsourcing focus on privacy issues but ignore the reliability of the process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based task matching scheme for crowdsourcing with a secure and reliable matching. Instead of utilizing a centralized cloud server, we employ smart contracts, an emerging blockchain technology, to provide reliable and transparent matching. In this way, data confidentiality and identity anonymity are achieved effectively and efficiently. The extensive privacy analysis and performance evaluation show that our solution is secure and feasible.

AB Nowadays digital transaction security is seen as essential in an online payment system. Earlier, cryptographic authentication techniques were used to make transactions very secure with third-party verification. However, in recent times, digital transactions have developed to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another, without the intervention of the third party. This kind of P2P network transaction is achieved by utilizing the blockchain innovation. A blockchain uses the idea of Bitcoin. It isn't observed by the central authority, but its clients direct and approve exchanges when one individual pays another for merchandise or administrations, dispensing with the requirement for outside confirmation. All finished exchanges are freely recorded as a block and each block is added one after other to form as a blockchain. In this paper, we present the workflow of a digital online payment system using the blockchain technique. We explain the secure sign-in procedure of the blockchain strategy. We elaborate on the effects of blockchain technology on the online transaction management system in terms of security and usability.

ID ACCESS-CONTROL; SECURITY; MODEL
AB In traditional electronic health records (EHRs), medical-related information is generally separately controlled by different hospitals and thus it leads to the inconvenience of information sharing. Cloud-based EHRs solve the problem of information sharing in the traditional EHRs. However, cloud-based EHRs suffer the centralized problem, i.e., cloud service center and key-generation center. This paper works on creating a new EHRs paradigm which can help in dealing with the centralized problem of cloud-based EHRs. Our solution is to make use of the emerging technology of blockchain to EHRs (denoted as blockchain-based EHRs for convenience). First, we formally define the system model of blockchain-based EHRs in the setting of consortium blockchain. In addition, the authentication issue is very important for EHRs. However, existing authentication schemes for blockchain-based EHRs have their own weak points. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose an authentication scheme for blockchain-based EHRs. Our proposal is an identity-based signature scheme with multiple authorities which can resist collusion attack out of N from N -1 authorities. Furthermore, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model and has more efficient signing and verification algorithms than existing authentication schemes of blockchain-based EHRs.

AB The main and challenging evolutionary process that leads towards the so-called Smarter City is still represented by the optimization of the Intelligent Systems for the Quality of Life (QoL) and the Quality of Services (QoS), and by the integration of heterogeneous IT services and different networks. The scientific interest in this field consists of promoting innovative solutions by use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) able to collect, analyse and obtain value added from a large amount of data generated by several sources: IoT devices, sensor networks, wearable devices as well as sensor grids, widespread within the urban environment. Furthermore, creating synergies and integrating different enabling technologies and informative platforms, remains the most challenge to overcome in order to obtain the optimization of the services and the quality of life. The Smart City involves the implementation of digital strategies that are necessary people-centred and lead into high technology-based innovations to build more capacities and opportunities. In this context, this paper intends to investigate the possibility to integrate the innovative and multi-purpose Blockchain Technology in the smart city evolutionary process, and in particular in the Smart Environment and Smart Mobility by allowing renewable energy sources traceability and by providing information about the kind of energy used to refuel, for example, the selected vehicle. The expected result consists of more user awareness regarding the environmental and energy sustainability.

AB For insurance sector it was investigated that the blockchain technology is still in the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully explored yet. Insurers are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not. The objective of this paperis to show the prospects for the transformation of insurance operational business processes in the context of innovative technologies.The research focuses precisely on the insurance sector, because among of 80 new, but real opportunities of using the blockchain technology, almost a quarter-ininsurance. Blockchain technology in combination with smart contracts can positively transform all insurers' internal processes (from customer involvement, underwriting to loss management and fraud avoidance), and even allow companies to enter new markets with new products.
   The article outlines the opportunities and potential of applying blockchain technology by the insurance sector of financial market, highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the technology, identifies the key advantages that blockchain provides for each of the insurer's main operational business processes: developing and selling an insurance product, data entry / identity assessment, risk assessment / premium calculation, customer service / back office, loss settlement and asset management.
   The study concludes that it is important for Ukrainian insurers today to acquire the necessary competencies by developing prototype blockchain solutions and asses show the technology will affect the existing insurance business model and how it will be accepted by staff and customers. Insurers can begin to act by focusing attention on three broad topics: the innovation landscape, their own priority areas for action, and possible operating models.

AB Blockchain technologies have recently come to the forefront of the research and industrial communities as they bring potential benefits for many industries. This is due to their practical capabilities in solving many issues currently inhibiting further advances in various industrial domains. Securely recording and sharing transactional data, establishing automated and efficient supply chain processes, and enhancing transparency across the whole value chain are some examples of these issues. Blockchain offers an effective way to tackle these issues using distributed, shared, secure, and permissioned transactional ledgers. The employment of blockchain technologies and the possibility of applying them in different situations enables many industrial applications through increased efficiency and security; enhanced traceability and transparency; and reduced costs. In this paper, different industrial application domains where the use of blockchain technologies has been proposed are reviewed. This paper explores the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of incorporating blockchain in different industrial applications. Furthermore, the paper attempts to identify the requirements that support the implementation of blockchain for different industrial applications. The review reveals that several opportunities are available for utilizing blockchain in various industrial sectors; however, there are still some challenges to be addressed to achieve better utilization of this technology.

AB In the Internet of Things (IoT), a cyber physical system (CPS) has achieved great success in a wide range of distributed integration environments. In the cyber physical system (CPS), interconnected sensing devices collect data in the surrounding environment and send data to all interested nodes through the network, thereby sharing all nodes data. This process can be implemented by using a publish/subscribe (pub/sub for short) system. Providing the basic security mechanisms such as authorization and confidentiality is a challenge due to the loose coupling of subscribers and publishers in such a pub/sub system. At the meanwhile, the existing IoT ecosystem mostly relies on a centralized server and thus faces the problem of single point failure. Thus, it is interesting to realize a brokerless or decentralized pub/sub model. Inspired by this motivation, this paper mainly proposes a privacy-preserving publish/subscribe model by using the blockchain technique, which evades the centralized trustroot setting and the problem of single point failure. Another key point of our proposal is that the primitive of public key encryption with equality test (PKEwET) is employed to enable all the required authorization, communication and topics matching can be finished in a confidential manner. Finally, a lightweight prototype of our proposal is implemented by using web3j, and the security and efficiency analysis are also presented.

AB Blockchain technology has been developed for more than ten years and has become a trend in various industries. As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.

AB Cyber-physical systems rely more and more on wireless technologies that operate in unmanaged, unlicensed frequency hands. Already today, this leads to security issues and a significant degradation of network performance due to interference and traffic congestion. Only collaboration between stakeholders leads to a sustainable solution. To facilitate collaboration, we designed a platform that heavily relies on the concept of Software-Defined Networking, introducing a central controller for programmable radio parameters. Part of this solution is a Brokering Platform that automates negotiation for spectral resources between access point (AP) operators. In this article we present a novel architecture for a Brokering Platform. We also propose secure distribution of Brokering Platform functionality over the APs using blockchain.

AB Trusted transaction, i.e. private keys protection and malware avoidance is a critical issue for blockchain platforms. This demonstration presents an innovative crypto terminal, whose security relies on two pillars, secure element and full firmware programming. The device uses open hardware and firmware. Its security policy is similar to bank card terminal. A crypto terminal enforces secure key storage, trusted signature, and is able to generate blockchain transactions.

DE Proof of sincerity; Consensus approach; Blockchain; Mobile-user-friendly
   mining
AB In this paper, we present the idea of proof of sincerity for a new consensus method for mobile-user-friendly blockchains. Ever since the birth of Bitcoin, there have been many distributed consensus methods studied to replace the central (or third-party) trusts to protect the integrity of the distributed ledgers. Existing methods show pros and cons but none of them showed a proper balance between the imbalance of wealth and the security of the ledgers. In proof of sincerity, by allowing each and every entity even with smaller computing power to get rewarded by mining, we can effectively prevent the extreme imbalance of the wealth (often caused by the mining that is dominated by a small number of huge resource owners). At the same time, by maintaining the appropriate level of sincerity in terms of the combination of the number of miners and the level of each mining work, we can effectively maintain the security level of the distributed ledgers.

AB Blockchain which enables decentralization of data based on various consensus mechanisms is considered the leading technology of the next generation. Numerous applications are being proposed to benefit from its immunity against modification and manipulation. However, not many appears as a successful business up to now, except for crypto currencies. High operation cost which is essential for the conventional consensus, is acting as an obstacle to the wide adoption of blockchain applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel blockchain platform based on PoP (Proof of Phone), which lowers the operating cost by imposing high entry cost. We conduct theoretical analysis to show that our proposed platform reduces total cost by up to 98.2% compared to that of conventional blockchain. Our new platform will turn various blockchain applications from theory to practice.

AB A centralized IoT network has a problem of data centralization because data is stored in a center. A blockchain is emerging as a solution to solve the problem in the IoT network by storing blocks to each device. However, lightweight IoT devices cannot store all of the blockchain due to their low storage capacity. We propose storage compression consensus (SCC) algorithm which compresses a blockchain in each device to ensure the storage capacity. When a lightweight device does not have enough storage space, the device processes the SCC to compress the blockchain. We implemented simulations to compare between the SCC and the existing consensus algorithm. As a result, the proposed SCC reduced the storage capacity of stored blockchain by 63% compared to the existing algorithm.

AB Resource-constrained distributed systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and fog computing are deployed for real-time monitoring and evaluation. Current security solutions are problematic when there is a centralized controlling entity. The blockchain provides decentralized security architectures using proof-of-work (PoW). Proof-of-work is an expensive process for IoT and edge computing due to the deployment of resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh) to replace Proof-of-Work and introduce authentication in such environments to make the blockchain application-specific. This paper implemented the Proof-of-Authentication system to evaluate its sustainability and applicability for the IoT and edge computing. The evaluation process is conducted in both simulation and real-time testbeds to evaluate performance. Finally, the process of Proof-of-Authentication and its integration with blockchain in resource-constrained distributed systems is discussed. Our proposed PoAh, while running in limited computer resources (e.g. single-board computing devices like the Raspberry Pi) has a latency in the order of 3 secs.

AB This paper presents a blockchain-based notarization service for social media. With the advent of smartphones, social media platforms have become an undeniably popular way to communicate with people across the world. However, fake news and maliciously fabricated screenshots are continuously produced and distributed on social media. Since blockchain technology can store data in a secure and tamper-proof way, it is a suitable platform for notarizing online activity. The problem is how we can verify the data to notarize. We propose an architecture that can authentically archive the contents on social media using blockchain technology. Based on the proposed method, an instant messaging scenario is presented as a proof-of-concept.

AB Flexible regulation of smart grid is vital for grid operation. This paper proposes a smart grid data aggregation and regulation mechanism based on consortium blockchain, and its signcryption algorithm can be applied to multidimensional data acquisition and multiple receivers in the consortium blockchain. In the process of regulation, the control center, the grid operator, and the equipment supplier receive fixed-height blocks from the blockchain and obtain plaintext from the decryption. Each receiver analyzes the multidimensional data and formulates corresponding control policies for individual users. Grid operators implement user power regulation by feedback on smart contracts. The security analysis and performance comparison show that the proposed scheme has advantages in computing and communication costs while meeting security requirements for confidentiality and data integrity.

AB Blockchain technology becomes increasingly popular. It also attracts scams, for example, a Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help to deal with this issue and to provide reusable research data sets for future research, this paper collects real-world samples and proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts (i.e., smart Ponzi schemes) on the blockchain. First, 200 smart Ponzi schemes are obtained by manually checking more than 3,000 open source smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Then, two kinds of features are extracted from the transaction history and operation codes of the smart contracts. Finally, a classification model is presented to detect smart Ponzi schemes. The extensive experiments show that the proposed model performs better than many traditional classification models and can achieve high accuracy for practical use. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 500 smart Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.

AB Recently, blockchain technology has been widely applied in the financial field. Therefore, the security of the blockchain smart contracts is among the most popular contemporary research topics. To improve the theorem-proving technology in this field, we are developing an extensible hybrid verification proof engine, denoted as FEther, for Ethereum smart contract verification. Based on Lolisa, which is a large subset of solidity mechanized in Coq, FEther guarantees the consistency between smart contracts and its formal model. Combining symbolic execution with higher order logic theorem-proving, FEther contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. Besides, in FEther, the verified code segments also can be reused to assist in the verification of other properties. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. The execution efficiency of FEther has far exceeded that of the interpreters that are developed in Coq in accordance with the standard tutorial. To the best of our knowledge, FEther is the first definitional interpreter of the solidity language in Coq.

AB With the sharp increase in the number of intelligent devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained more and more attention and rapid development in recent years. It effectively integrates the physical world with the Internet over existing network infrastructure to facilitate sharing data among intelligent devices. However, its complex and large-scale network structure brings new security risks and challenges to IoT systems. To ensure the security of data, traditional access control technologies are not suitable to be directly used for implementing access control in IoT systems because of their complicated access management and the lack of credibility due to centralization. In this paper, we proposed a novel attribute-based access control scheme for IoT systems, which simplifies greatly the access management. We use blockchain technology to record the distribution of attributes in order to avoid single point failure and data tampering. The access control process has also been optimized to meet the need for high efficiency and lightweight calculation for IoT devices. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively resist multiple attacks and be efficiently implemented in IoT systems.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used because of its high efficiency and real-time collaboration. A wireless sensor network is the core technology to support the operation of the IoT, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Aiming at the problem that the existing malicious node detection methods in wireless sensor networks cannot be guaranteed by fairness and traceability of detection process, we present a blockchain trust model (BTM) for malicious node detection in wireless sensor networks. First, it gives the whole framework of the trust model. Then, it constructs the blockchain data structure which is used to detect malicious nodes. Finally, it realizes the detection of malicious nodes in 3D space by using the blockchain smart contract and the WSNs' quadrilateral measurement localization method, and the voting consensus results are recorded in the blockchain distributed. The simulation results show that the model can effectively detect malicious nodes in WSNs, and it can also ensure the traceability of the detection process.

TI DLattice: A Permission-Less Blockchain Based on DPoS-BA-DAG Consensus
   for Data Tokenization
SO IEEE ACCESS

   protocols; directed acyclic graph
AB In today's digital information age, the conflict between the public's growing awareness of their own data protection and the data owners' inability to obtain data ownership has become increasingly prominent. The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.

ID BROADCAST ENCRYPTION; GENERIC CONSTRUCTION; SIGNATURES
AB Aggregate signature scheme allows each signer to sign a different message and then all those signatures are aggregated into a single short signature. In contrast, multisignature scheme allows multisigners to jointly sign only one message. Aggregate multisignature scheme is a combination of both aforementioned signature schemes, where signers can choose to generate either a multisignature or an aggregate signature. This combination scheme has many concrete application scenarios such as Bitcoin blockchain, Healthcare, Multicast Acknowledgment Aggregation, and so on. On the other hand, to deal with the problems of expensive certificates in certified public key cryptography and key escrow in identity-based cryptography, the notion of certificateless public key cryptography has been introduced by Riyami and Paterson at Asiacrypt'03. In this paper, we propose the first certificateless aggregate multisignature scheme that achieves the constant-size of signature and is secure in the standard model under a generalization of the Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. In our scheme, however, the signature is generated with the help of the authority.

AB Although ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals allow subjects suffering from neuromuscular disorders to interface their brains with the cyber-physical world, occupational therapy can be enhanced with the introduction of further modalities better assist the disabled person. In this paper, we propose an in-home occupational therapy environment, which leverages a rich set of occupational therapy-related activity recognition modalities, namely, EEG signals to understand brain activity, ElectroMyoGram (EMG) signals for muscle activity, gesture-tracking sensors for forward and inverse kinematics activities, and smart home appliance control sensors. To support a wide variety of disabled people's in-home occupational therapy, we have incorporated both selective attention and motor imagery processes for mapping a mental command with that of an occupational therapy-related command within a serious game environment. To attain higher accuracy and to avoid a higher number of false positives, a subject is first recommended to use a selective attention-based serious game in which a digital avatar of the subject acting as a model therapist will guide the therapy session. Once familiar with the generation of proper motor imagery, an advanced user can use self-paced motor imagery signals to perform occupational therapy activities within the serious game environment. The occupational therapy consists of a serious game environment in which smart home appliances are mapped with therapeutic activities through forward and inverse kinematics. The therapy data has been secured through blockchain and off-chain-based distributed repositories. The test results show the viability of using the framework in a clinical environment.

TI bcBIM: A Blockchain-Based Big Data Model for BIM Modification Audit and
   Provenance in Mobile Cloud
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Building Information Modeling (BIM) is envisioned as an indispensable opportunity in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries as a revolutionary technology and process. Smart construction relies on BIM for manipulating information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM model has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but rare works pay efforts to information security, e.g., critical model audit and sensitive model exposure. Moreover, few BIM systems are proposed to chase after upcoming computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose a novel BIM system model called bcBIM to tackle information security in mobile cloud architectures. More specifically, bcBIM is proposed to facilitate BIM data audit for historical modifications by blockchain in mobile cloud with big data sharing. The proposed bcBIM model can guide the architecture design for further BIM information management system, especially for integrating BIM cloud as a service for further big data sharing. We propose a method of BIM data organization based on blockchains and discuss it based on private and public blockchain. It guarantees to trace, authenticate, and prevent tampering with BIM historical data. At the same time, it can generate a unified format to support future open sharing, data audit, and data provenance.

TI Privacy-Oriented Blockchain-Based Distributed Key Management
   Architecture for Hierarchical Access Control in the IoT Scenario
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article

   Things
AB The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the explosive growth of valuable data produced by user equipment have led to strong demand for access control, especially hierarchical access control, which is performed from a group communication perspective. However, the key management strategies for such a future Internet are based mostly on a trusted third party that requires full trust of the key generation center (KGC) or central authority (CA). Recent studies indicate that centralized cloud centers will be unlikely to deliver satisfactory services to customers because we place too much trust in third parties; therefore, these centers do not apply to user privacy-oriented scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel blockchain-based distributed key management architecture (BDKMA) with fog computing to reduce latency and multiblockchains operated in the cloud to achieve cross-domain access. The proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology to satisfy the decentralization, fine-grained auditability, high scalability, and extensibility requirements, as well as the privacy-preserving principles for hierarchical access control in IoT. We designed system operations methods and introduced different authorization assignment modes and group access patterns to reinforce the extensibility. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with existing models using various performance measures. The simulation results show that the multiblockchain structure substantially improves system performance, and the scalability is excellent as the network size increases. Furthermore, dynamic transaction collection time adjustment enables the performance and system capacity to be optimized for various environments.

AB Blockchain is probably best known as a technology that underpins bitcoin cryptocurrency, taking records (e.g., confirmed financial transactions) and placing them into 'blocks', which are linked to prior blocks - forming a chronological 'chain' of blocks. However, bitcoin blockchain is only one instantiation of blockchain technology and there exist a few qualitative analyses addressing instantiations of blockchain technology. The aim of this study was two-fold: 1) to understand the difference between bitcoin and blockchain; 2) to delineate the need (and role) of governance in blockchain technology. First, fundamental relationships (and differences) between bitcoin and blockchain are presented. Second, drawing on societal blockchain technology concerns, a key element (i.e., governance) and its role in shaping blockchain technology is suggested. This research concludes with possible areas of research (and research questions) that can enable realisation of blockchain governance along the areas philosophical, theoretical, axiological, methodological, axiomatic, method and application dimensions.

AB Today's e-health system is centralized. This system obliges all users (patients and healthcare staff) to have a high level of trust in the intermediary who stores the data. Moreover, healthcare employees must trust that their patients are providing authentic medical records and are not altering them in order to obtain drugs for illegal purposes. The solution proposed in this paper is a new blockchain-based architecture for the creation of an e-health system. In this architecture, wireless sensor networks (WSN) will be used in association with a WSN controller v.2 to supervise patients and their testing by healthcare staff. Transactions between blockchain and WSN are made through smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries and preventing human error. This new model facilitates a distributed ledger, creating an e-health system that is much more optimized than the current one.

AB Among those technological tools which currently trigger great interest are so-called "blockchains". Since the launch of Blockchain in 2009, many such systems have been devised. As is apparent, this technology tends to eliminate intermediaries, while guaranteeing and even increase the security they provide. At the same time, it improves efficiency while reducing costs. Like any other new technology, it must address the legal challenges that arise from its use. The goal of this paper is to address some of those referred to public blockchains-specially, Blockchain-, to wit: the lack of ownership, the limits of their registry functions, concerns regarding the identity of the participants, the character of cryptocurrencies and their relationship to tax structure or legal money, and finally, the legal smart contracts that can be executed using this technology.

AB For virtual private network and LAN-to-LAN tunnel sessions, End-to-End security is the main constraint in private messaging scenarios. Internet Protocol Security can negotiate new keys for every communication, but when the key is compromised, it is a problem. Perfect Forward Secrecy is the resolution. In addition, the messaging scheme should be efficient and lightweight for keeping parity with daily needs. The popular Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cipher is omnipresent in secure communications but has many scientific problems. So here, in this paper, a lightweight and efficient Secure Hybrid RSA (SHRSA) messaging scheme with four-layered authentication stack is implemented and analyzed. The scheme is resolving the problem of asymptotic very low speed of decryption of RSA, the computational modular exponentiation complexity and partial key exposure vulnerability issues of RSA, and many more. The four-layered authentication stack have eliminated the need of the use of any password, external digital certificates, and a third party for authentication with its own four techniques in a staked way. We have found that in evolutions and analysis of the scheme, it is not only resolving various scientific problems of RSA but also occupying 2%-4% less CPU than main RSA and occupying 1%-3% less memory than main RSA. Its decryption average time has gained 8.858 times compared to the main RSA and gained 2.248 times compared to CRT RSA. We have found that the RSA, CRT-RSA, and SHRSA's encryption throughput are alike-all are around 6 KB/Sec but decryption throughput of SHRSA has gained 8.5345 times than main RSA and gained 2.1174 times than CRT-RSA. The results obtained have shown us the relevancies of the SHRSA messaging scheme to be integratable as a cipher in Blockchain architectures, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Everything.

AB The certified mail is a value-added service that is widely used in the paper world. However, the scientific community has not yet provided a solution for certified e-mail that has achieved widespread acceptance. This lack of a certified e-mail solution is not due to a lack of proposed approaches; because over the past 40 years, more than 100 protocols have been reported in journals and at conferences. The vast majority of these proposed protocols use a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness. The few solutions without a TTP have not been successful due to their high computational and/or communication cost. Blockchain provides a new approach to develop the protocols without a TTP but without the prior drawbacks of the previous solutions without a TTP. Here, we present a new protocol for certified e-mail based on a blockchain without a conventional TTP that is integrated with the conventional e-mail infrastructure. The protocol is secure, efficient, and viable from a practical perspective.

TI A Delay-Tolerant Payment Scheme Based on the Ethereum Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; delay-tolerant network; digital banking; remote regions
AB Digital banking as an essential service can be hard to access in remote, rural regions where the network connectivity is unavailable or intermittent. The payment operators like Visa and Mastercard often face difficulties reaching these remote, rural areas. Although micro-banking has been made possible by short message service or unstructured supplementary service data messages in some places, their security flaws and session-based nature prevent them from wider adoption. Global-level cryptocurrencies enable low-cost, secure, and pervasive money transferring among distributed peers, but are still limited in their ability to reach people in remote communities. We propose a blockchain-based digital payment scheme that can deliver reliable services on top of unreliable networks in remote regions. We focus on a scenario where a community-run base station provides reliable local network connectivity while intermittently connects to the broader Internet. We take advantage of the distributed verification guarantees of the Blockchain technology for financial transaction verification and leverage smart contracts for secure service management. In the proposed system, payment operators deploy multiple proxy nodes that are intermittently connected to the remote communities where the local blockchain networks, such as Ethereum are composed of miners, vendors, and regular users. Through probabilistic modeling, we devise design parameters for the blockchain network to realize robust operation over the top of the unreliable network. Furthermore, we show that the transaction processing time will not be significantly impacted due to the network unreliability through extensive emulations on a private Ethereum network. Finally, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed system by developing Near Field Communication (NFC)-enabled payment gateways on Raspberry-Pis, a mobile wallet application and mining nodes on off-the-shelf computers.

AB In MOOCs, the learning resources authentication is a matter of great concern for the learners and teachers. Its construction is faced with the challenges of information security and privacy protection. Considering that the blockchain has the advantages of decentralisation, autonomous and non-tampering, this paper provides a solution to implement the construction based on blockchain technology, which includes the system architecture, experimental validation and key technologies such as decentralised transaction and tamper-resistance. The results prove the technical feasibility and safety reliability of blockchain to learning resource management in MOOCs.

AB The smart grid environment requires the enhancement of various computational tools, especially for routine tasks of data acquisition and system monitoring. This paper presents the building blocks of a conceptual framework to be used as the basis for the construction of novel distributed remote metering systems with utilization of the cutting edge Blockchain technology. The proposed methodology is suitable for processing a large volume of data aimed at monitoring modern electric power distribution grids. As a proof of concept, a collaborative metering system is conceived based on the Blockchain technology, being primarily capable of: dealing with the entirety of the collected data (conveniently stored and filtered); assuring data integrity by means of cryptography; optimizing implementation/operation costs of the telecommunication services involved. Simulation results concerning the reliability and performance of the designed distributed remote metering system are presented.

DT Article
DE blockchain; smart contract; block-time; mining; actor-network theory;
   trust; responsibility; social concepts
AB The article studies the influence of blockchain technology on the formation of semantic structures in the social world. The feature of this influence is that the usage of a decentralized distributed database challenges traditional forms of social interactions, serving as a catalyst for constituting social values without analogues in the social world. Because the concepts developed in classical social theory are used to describe these values, this requires an actualization of its thesaurus. In particular, the article studies the concepts of trust, responsibility, time, and mining in the context of the introduction of blockchain technology. Because the content of these concepts is open and developing, they are given the status of social concepts. The study uses the actor-network theory as a theoretical and methodological basis. It lets us abandon conventions of common knowledge, and shows that these concepts are semantic nodes which emerge as trails (or links to trails) of the configured actions of actor-actants. In conclusion, the studied concepts are proposed to be used with the following meanings: (1) trust is confidence in algorithmized certainty processes and the actions of communication participants, and is based on the guarantees provided by decentralized information systems and on restricting freedom by subjecting anonymous collective identities; (2) responsibility is the personal willingness of participants to take actions in conditions of uncertainty, and to compensate risks; (3) block-time is the own-time of the technology of blocking, which characterizes the state of the protocol for the external observer. For the internal observer, block-time is chronological, since it fixes the timeless stability of the algorithm which connects blocks with each other; (4) mining is a kind of economic activity based on the synthesis of cryptographic technologies and the perception of archaic ideas about risk, luck, and wealth.

DE Blockchain; event validation; proof-of-event consensus; trust
   verification; vehicular ad-hoc networks
AB Sharing traffic information on the vehicular network can help in the implementation of intelligent traffic management, such as car accident warnings, road construction notices, and driver route changes to reduce traffic congestion earlier. In the future, in the case of autonomous driving, traffic information will be exchanged more frequently and more immediately. Once the exposed traffic incident is incorrect, the driving route will be misleading, and the driving response may be in danger. The blockchain ensures the correctness of data and tampers resistance in the consensus mechanism, which can solve such similar problems. This paper proposes a proof-of-event consensus concept applicable to vehicular networks rather than proof-of-work or proof-of-authority approaches. The traffic data are collected through the roadside units, and the passing vehicles will verify the correctness when receiving the event notification. In addition, a two-phase transaction on blockchain is introduced to send warning messages in appropriate regions and time periods. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively feedback the correctness of traffic events and provide traceable events with trust verification.

AB Successful global supply chain management (SCM) traceability refers to 'the ability to identify and trace the history, distribution, location and application of products, parts and materials, to ensure the reliability of sustainability claims, in the areas of human rights, labor (including health and safety), the environmental factors and anticorruption. In response to the problem of cross-border telecommunications fraud crimes, we have proposed a conceptual system that enables the rapid sharing of intelligence information across all branches of the country. The decentralized blockchain network has a global flow of information and does not require high service costs and transaction costs, greatly improving cross-border collaboration efficiency. We use Ethereum smart contract to schedule visits to the system in different storage departments. The system can provide early warning and track cross-border economic crime intelligence according to ABB's provision of big data. CA and PBC provide information flow and capital flow. The blockchain concept architecture has also been evaluated for its advantages in project security, privacy and interoperability.

ID SMART CONTRACTS
AB Despite common arguments about the prevalence of blockchain technology, in terms of security, privacy, and immutability, in reality, several attacks can be launched against them. This paper provides a systematic literature review on long-range attacks for proof of stake protocols. If successful, these attacks may take over the main chain and partially, or even completely, rewrite the history of transactions that are stored in the blockchain. To this end, we describe how proof of stake protocols work, their fundamental properties, their drawbacks, and their attack surface. After presenting long-range attacks, we discuss possible countermeasures and their applicability.

AB Digital transformation will pose growing challenges to tax revenues and systems of taxation that were designed for another century. The tax rules may hasten slowly, but the record of response to the challenges of electronic commerce, and of base erosion and profit shifting, shows that tax administration is more adaptable. This article identifies the detailed nature of technological changes in electronics and systems; big data, automation and artificial intelligence; and security, including blockchain; as those changes affect tax administration. It highlights the critical taxpayer rights issues and applies accepted taxpayer rights frameworks. The article concludes that taxpayer rights principles are both highly adaptable to a digital world, and provide useful guidance to where urgent action and further research are required.

AB Before the implementation of a solution, it is cost-efficient and practical to be able to evaluate and analyze the expected value of use cases. Especially, this is emphasized in blockchain (BC) use cases, which typically have a wide business ecosystem and possibly disruptive business models. This paper presents two BC use case value evaluations and results. The IoT use cases were selected from two different industry segments: telecommunications-oriented 5G network slice brokering and the energy industry-related internal electricity allocation in a housing society. The use case value was assessed by applying a resource configuration framework and 4C - commerce, context, content, and connection - business model typology against BC and smart contracts characteristics and capabilities. The results derived from the data collected from the expert workshops proved the expected value of the use cases, and in general, the feasibility of BC technology for facilitating various value-creating resource configuration processes was shown. Furthermore, the resource configuration framework proved to be a valuable theoretical approach for analyzing and developing also the BC-enabled novel use cases and business models. According to the findings, further development of the framework is proposed with an introduced novel decentralized resource configuration prototype that can replace predominant platform-based business models.

AB Topic. Maritime shipping is an important component of the transport system, ensuring the development of trade relations both within a particular country and abroad. At the same time, this is an infrastructure sector, which makes it dependent on current trends in the economic development of the world. In this regard, one of the primary tasks of the transport industry should be a movement towards ensuring the growth of the national economy and its integration into the world economic system, which is impossible without the adoption and implementation of the digitalization concept of the global economy.
   Purpose of the study is to identify potential opportunities for improving shipping efficiency based on the paradigm of the digital economy.
   Methods of research. The methodology is based on the analysis of approaches to the formation of sustainable competitive advantages of shipping; comparative, statistical and dynamic analysis of indicators characterizing the possibility of increasing the efficiency of navigation through the use of the digital economy paradigm.
   Results. It is substantiated that at the moment the prerequisites have already been formed and the conditions have been created for the active implementation of digital technologies in the practice of maritime navigation. Several key concepts are highlighted, such as single window, e-Navigation, blockchain.
   Conclusion. The impact of the implementation of the e-Navigation concept on improving of Russian ports and shipping companies activity is analyzed in the article. The novelty lies in the consideration of the "ship-seaport" logistics link as a business ecosystem and the use of "end-to-end technologies" of digitalization, which allow switching to the "single window" mode from the point of view of information support. The practical implementation of the proposed approach will allow identifying additional sources of competitive advantages of the national segment of the shipping business.

AB Blockchain Technology (BCT) is a growing and reliable technology in various fields such as developing business deals, economic environments, social and politics as well. Without having a trusted central party this technology, gives the guarantee for safe and reliable transactions using Bitcoin or Ethereum. In this paper BCT has been considered using Bitcoins. Also Blockchain Single and Interval Valued Neutrosophic Graphs have been proposed and applied in transaction of Bitcoins. Also degree, total degree, minimum and maximum degree have been found for the proposed graphs. Further, comparative analysis is done with advantages and limitations of different types of Blockchain graphs.

ID AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL; EFFICIENT
AB As the Internet of Vehicle (IOV) being widely applied throughout our daily life, how to secure data privacy of each vehicle is nowadays a hot topic. Taking an aim of solving this problem, a privacy protection system on double-layered chain basis is designed to eliminate the said security risk during vehicle data communication. At the same time, the nontampering nature of the block chain is used to realize reasonable arbitration in traffic accident disputes, vehicle insurance claims, and other states of affairs. Specifically, an IOV double-layered chain model is constructed to simulate a semicentralized system that is convenient for government to supervise; also, a RSA protocol based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is designed to bring safety and zero-knowledge property to the system; finally, we give the application scenario of this IOV privacy protection system based on double-layered chain that it can be widely used in vehicle-sharing industry. The communication costs, respectively, under double-layered chain and single-layered chain frameworks, are compared to prove that the double-layered structure does save cost. Thus an IOV privacy scheme that is safer and more cost-efficient is given.

TI Revolutionizing Global Supply Chains One Block at a Time: Growing
   International Trade with Blockchain: Are International Rules Up to the
   Task?
SO GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB There is growing interest in blockchain's potential to transform the logistics of international trade through its application to supply chains to increase efficiencies and minimize vulnerabilities. Yet for blockchain to truly transport supply chains on a global scale, laws and regulations that facilitate and support its implementation are required This article explores potential regulatory barriers to the development of blockchain technology in supply chains and asks whether there is a role for international trade rules to address these barriers.

TI Trustworthy Electronic Voting Using Adjusted Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Electronic voting; blockchain voting; i-voting; e-voting; blockchain
   Pakistan; future voting
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; SEARCH; IMPACT; TRUST
AB The electronic voting has emerged over time as a replacement to the paper-based voting to reduce the redundancies and inconsistencies. The historical perspective presented in the last two decades suggests that it has not been so successful due to the security and privacy flaws observed over time. This paper suggests a framework by using effective hashing techniques to ensure the security of the data. The concept of block creation and block sealing is introduced in this paper. The introduction of a block sealing concept helps in making the blockchain adjustable to meet the need of the polling process. The use of consortium blockchain is suggested, which ensures that the blockchain is owned by a governing body (e.g., election commission), and no unauthorized access can be made from outside. The framework proposed in this paper discusses the effectiveness of the polling process, hashing algorithms' utility, block creation and sealing, data accumulation, and result declaration by using the adjustable blockchain method. This paper claims to apprehend the security and data management challenges in blockchain and provides an improved manifestation of the electronic voting process.

AB Internet of Things is the one based on data analytics and the competence to gain an accurate and deep understanding about the sensors. Security is the most crucial and vital need for developing IoT Communication wireless network. Classical Cryptography has provide a way to ensure the fundamental needs of communication networks but the security is not to the optimal level and the downside may be dealt by Quantum technology. To constrain these insights, IoT applications depend on neural networks and machine learning to extract Knowledge data based decision support. The DORBRI architecture proposed in this paper addresses the issues that are faced by the cryptosystem through the Post-Quantum cryptography based Quantum IoT. The block chain allows us to ensure the soundness and permanence of the information since you cannot modify or capture data without that particular action get recorded. Communication over the proposed secure channel will be faster and considerably reduce the loss of data.

AB The world has evolved to a point where it is impossible to imagine interaction without networks or without connections between devices and people. The advent of the fifth industrial revolution saw the rise of interconnected devices and 'things'. Internet of Things (IoT) has become the defacto standard for devices and people communicating with each other. The newer the devices that are released in the market so has to be the security be updated to counter security attacks. Every device has to be updated to the latest firmware to keep it secure and work optimally; this paper proposes an architecture to facilitate a secure firmware update in a distributed trust-based blockchain IoT network.

AB In this paper we propose a novel system for identity verification by amalgamating online signature verification, machine learning, IOT and blockchain to garner their potentials to cope up and to contain this risk of identity theft specifically in the case of online transactions. In this system signals of roll, pitch and yaw values retrieved from MPU6050 sensor (Inertial Measurement Unit) are analysed using Digital Time Wrapping to obtain DTW minimum distance to verify the identity of the user. In case of cryptocurrencies, we propose a system where private key is not stored anywhere but the same unique private key, assigned to the user by Blockchain, is generated every time with the help of method incorporating biometrics and machine learning. The required data will then be sent to blockchain with the help of IOT system to complete the transaction.

AB Background: Essential tremor (ET), one of the most common neurological disorders is typically evaluated with validated rating scales which only provide a subjective assessment during a clinical visit, underestimating the fluctuations tremor during different daily activities. Motion sensors have shown favorable performances in both quantifying tremor and voluntary human activity recognition (HAR).
   Objective: To create an automated system of a reference scale using motion sensors supported by deep learning algorithms to accurately rate ET severity during voluntary activities, and to propose an IOTA based blockchain application to share anonymously tremor data.
   Method: A smartwatch-based tremor monitoring system was used to collect motion data from 20 subjects while they were doing standard tasks. Two neurologists rated ET by Fahn-Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS). Supported by deep learning techniques, activity classification models (ACMs) and tremor evaluation models (TEMs) were created and algorithms were implemented, to distinguish voluntary human activities and evaluate tremor severity respectively.
   Result A practical application example showed that the proposed ACMs can classify six typical activities with high accuracy (89.73%-98.84%) and the results produced by the TEMs are significantly correlated with the FTMTRS ratings of two neurologists (r(1 )= 0.92, p(1) = 0.008; r(2) = 0.93, p(2) = 0.007).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that motion sensor data, supported by deep learning algorithms, can be used to classify human activities and evaluate essential tremor severity during different activities.

TI A Fog Computing-Based Architecture for Medical Records Management
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING

DT Article
AB The aging of the world's population and the growth in the number of people with chronic diseases have increased expenses with medical care. Thus, the use of technological solutions has been widely adopted in the medical field to improve the patients' health. In this context, approaches based on Cloud Computing have been used to store and process the information generated in these solutions. However, using Cloud can create delays that are intolerable for medical applications. Thus, the Fog Computing paradigm emerged as an alternative to overcome this problem, bringing computation and storage closer to the data sources. However, managing medical data stored in Fog is still a challenge. Moreover, characteristics of availability, performance, interoperability, and privacy need to be considered in approaches that aim to explore this problem. So, this article shows a software architecture based on Fog Computing and designed to facilitate the management of medical records. This architecture uses Blockchain concepts to provide the necessary privacy features and to allow Fog Nodes to carry out the authorization process in a distributed way. Finally, this paper describes a case study that evaluates the performance, privacy, and interoperability requirements of the proposed architecture in a home-centered healthcare scenario.

AB In modern conditions, the significant growth rate is based on the digital economy development and technological leadership. In order to increase human, intellectual and technological advantages in the digital economy, it is necessary to act in areas of systemic importance. The digital economy is the sale of goods and services based on digital electronic technologies. This is the economy of services where the seller or service provider and the consumer practically do not meet in person. Most transactions are made via the Internet.
   The digital currency is just a variation, a derivative tool, one of the types of blockchain system - the technology of decentralized data storage, the chain of transaction blocks, built according to certain rules and providing absolute protection against changes. One of the integral infrastructural elements of the digital economy is electronic money, which appeared as the result of the long evolution of different money types.
   Currently, fiat money is keeping the leading position in the sphere of financial processes implementation. It is struggling to satisfy the needs of the owners. However, it is obvious that traditional paper currency is no longer able to cope with its tasks next to the growing economy in the virtual world. Thus, only digital means are able to completely replace them.

AB With the wide application of mobile healthcare systems, the total amount of healthcare data is ever increasing rapidly as users interact with healthcare service providers frequently. This leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data. Existing work mainly pay attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But they cannot adapt to the increasing amount of global healthcare data and suffer from complex application challenges, respectively. Decentralized and collaborative data management assisted by edge computing exhibits major advantages in improving overall system performance. We present a secure and efficient data management system named as EdgeCare for mobile healthcare systems. Local authorities are established to schedule edge servers for processing healthcare data and facilitating data trading. A hierarchical architecture with collaboration is designed for feasible implementation of EdgeCare. After that, we investigate secure data uploading and sharing in the system. We use an electronic medical record to show how healthcare data is processed with security considerations. We also conduct the Stackelberg game-based optimization algorithm to approach the optimal incentive mechanism for a data collector and users in the fair decentralized data trading. The numerical results with security analysis are provided to demonstrate that EdgeCare offers effective solutions to protect healthcare data, and support efficient data trading.

AB The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.

AB In complex Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) application systems, there may exist a variety of functional sub-systems which provide divergent services to the users and the relationship among these services could be strong, which is evidently very common in practice. As one such IoT application, the smart city is designed to use intelligent services in an environment where transport, environment, energy, living, governance, and civic components are integrated to operate the city in a smart and efficient manner. Surprisingly, however, the current state-of-the-art on blockchain does not show the progress on diversified services of the complex IIoT applications. This paper tends to fill the gap and presents a scalable block graph platform and consensus protocol for the complex IIoT applications by adopting the limited resources of IIoT devices. The platform and consensus protocol are generic in the sense that they can support any practical service. The directed acyclic graph represents a significant exhibition in improving the scalability of blockchains and supports our proposed consensus protocol in substance; moreover, the detailed syntax of the block graph is defined. The consensus protocol is showed to be secure against disloyal voting, sybil attack, and 51% attack. The real use case of smart city demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposal.

AB In recent years, food safety issues have drawn growing concerns from society. In order to efficiently detect and prevent food safety problems and trace the accountability, building a reliable traceability system is indispensable. It is especially essential to accurately record, share, and trace the specific data within the whole food supply chain, including the process of production, processing, warehousing, transportation, and retail. The traditional traceability systems have issues, such as data invisibility, tampering, and sensitive information disclosure. The blockchain is a promising technology for the food safety traceability system because of the characteristics, such as the irreversible time vector, smart contract, and consensus algorithm. This paper proposes a food safety traceability system based on the blockchain and the EPC Information Services and develops a prototype system. The management architecture of on-chain & off-chain data is proposed as well, through which the traceability system can alleviate the data explosion issue of the blockchain for the Internet of Things. Furthermore, the enterprise-level smart contract is designed to prevent data tampering and sensitive information disclosure during information interaction among participants. The prototype system was implemented based on the Ethereum. According to the test results, the average time of information query response is around 2 ms, while the amount of on-chain data and query counts are 1 GB and 1000 times/s, respectively.

AB In this paper, we present an analysis of the mining process of two popular assets, Bitcoin and gold. The analysis highlights that Bitcoin, more specifically its underlying technology, is a safe haven that allows facing the modern environmental challenges better than gold. Our analysis emphasizes that crypto-currencies systems have a social and economic impact much smaller than that of the traditional financial systems. We present an analysis of the several stages needed to produce an ounce of gold and an artificial agent-based market model simulating the Bitcoin mining process and allowing the quantification of Bitcoin mining costs. In this market model, miners validate the Bitcoin transactions using the proof of work as the consensus mechanism, get a reward in Bitcoins, sell a fraction of them to cover their expenses, and stay competitive in the market by buying and divesting hardware units and adjusting their expenses by turning off/on their machines according to the signals provided by a technical analysis indicator, the so-called relative strength index.

DT Article

AB The authors have analyzed crimes connected with the use of virtual currency in the regional and international aspects. They introduce a new category of "cryptocrime" understood as the aggregate of publically dangerous acts, united by their common systemic characteristics, committed against or using the products of distributed registries (cryptocurrency, tokens and other forms of digital financial assets). They analyze each of the cryptocrime segments separately: illegal trade in psychoactive substances (narcotics, psychoactive substances, precursors), pornography and other prohibited content (including illegal services); laundering of criminal proceeds; theft of cryptocurrency and tokens. Using the scientific research methods (comparative, sociological, statistical analysis and extrapolation of data, building a trend line, etc.) the authors identify regularities in the dynamics of each type of cryptocrime as well as key factors facilitating them. The goal of the authors is to conduct a systemic examination of crimes committed against and using cryptocurrency and to determine the prospects of developing different segments of cryptocrime. To achieve this goal, they analyze qualitative and quantitative characteristics of illegal trade in narcotics and pornography, legalization of criminal proceeds and theft of digital assets. They name the anonymity of cryptocurrency as a factor facilitating illegal trade in drugs, while the growing scope of the legalization of criminal proceeds and theft is facilitated by the fact that cryptocurrency and tokens do not have a legal status as objects of civil law and objects of encroachments on property. The analysis allows the authors to conclude that without effective criminological measures the level of such crimes will continue to grow and may double by the end of 2019. According to the authors, the priority directions of international criminal policy in the sphere of cryptocrime prevention include determining cryptocurrencies' legal status, licensing cryptocurrency trade (stock exchange services, exchange platforms, companies issuing tokens), setting international standards of counteracting the legalization of criminal proceeds and the financing of terrorism, creating a cryptocrime database.

TI Network Layer Aspects of Permissionless Blockchains
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS

DT Article
DE Network security; peer-to-peer network; permissionless blockchain;
   anonymity
ID BITCOIN
AB Permissionless blockchains reach decentralized consensus without requiring pre-established identities or trusted third parties, thus enabling applications such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Consensus is agreed on data that is generated by the application and transmitted by the system's (peer-to-peer) network layer. While many attacks on the network layer were discussed so far, there is no systematic approach that brings together known attacks, the requirements, and the design space of the network layer. In this paper, we survey attacks on the network layer of permissionless blockchains, and derive five requirements: 1) performance; 2) low cost of participation; 3) anonymity; 4) DoS resistance; and 5) topology hiding. Furthermore, we survey the design space of the network layer and qualitatively show the effect of each design decisions on the fulfillment of the requirements. Finally, we pick two aspects of the design space, in-band peer discovery and relay delay, and demonstrate possible directions of future research by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing simplified scenarios. We show that while most design decisions imply certain tradeoffs, there is a lack of models that analyze and formalize these tradeoffs. Such models could aid the design of the network layer of permissionless blockchains. One reason for the lack of models is the deliberately limited observability of deployed blockchains. We emphasize that simulation based approaches cope with these limitations and are suited for the analysis of the network layer of permissionless blockchains.

AB This paper surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security services. These services include authentication, confidentiality, privacy and access control list, data and resource provenance, and integrity assurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed applications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over the networks and the use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality guarantees that data cannot be read by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability to control who can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data and resources along with their ownership and utilization over the network. Integrity helps in verifying that the data has not been modified or altered. These services are currently managed by centralized controllers, for example, a certificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the centralized controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and distributed ledger that can help resolve many of the problems with centralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the use of security services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art techniques that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their challenges, and to discuss how the blockchain technology can resolve these challenges. Further, several blockchain-based approaches providing such security services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated with using blockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research in this area.

AB In the last century, the automotive industry has arguably transformed society, being one of the most complex, sophisticated, and technologically advanced industries, with innovations ranging from the hybrid, electric, and self-driving smart cars to the development of IoT-connected cars. Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain, which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability, accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness, and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges. Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it. Finally, after strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry developments.

AB Factories use many manufacturing processes that consume a lot of energy and highly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The introduction of the concept of Industrial Internet in USA and Industry 4.0 in Europe offers many opportunities to reduce energy consumption in these factories. Introducing and utilizing smart techniques for the applications pertinent to manufacturing processes within the Industry 4.0 domain can offer many benefits for reducing energy consumption in smart factories. This paper investigates and discusses these opportunities and benefits. This paper also discusses the roles of Industry 4.0 technologies in enabling these opportunities. Consequently, introducing these capabilities will help significantly reduce both production costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper then provides a benefit analysis that shows the advantages of such leverage. In addition, this paper offers an enabling architecture and its components that include a cyber-physical system manufacturing services' layer, a fog manufacturing services' layer, a cloud manufacturing services' layer, and a blockchain-based service-oriented middleware to support such opportunities.

AB In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based infrastructure to support security- and privacy-oriented spatio-temporal smart contract services for the sustainable Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sharing economy in mega smart cities. The infrastructure leverages cognitive fog nodes at the edge to host and process offloaded geo-tagged multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge and IoT nodes, uses AI for processing and extracting significant event information, produces semantic digital analytics, and saves results in Blockchain and decentralized cloud repositories to facilitate sharing economy services. The framework offers a sustainable incentive mechanism, which can potentially support secure smart city services, such as sharing economy, smart contracts, and cyber-physical interaction with Blockchain and IoT. Our unique contribution is justified by detailed system design and implementation of the framework.

AB Blockchain as emerging technology is revolutionizing several industries, and its abundant privileges have opened up a bunch of research directions in various industries; thereby, it has acquired many interests from the research community. The rapid evolution of blockchain research papers in recent years has resulted in a need to conduct research studies that investigate a detailed analysis of the current body of knowledge in this field. To address this need, a few review papers have been published to report the latest accomplishments and challenges of blockchain technology from different perspectives. Nonetheless, there has not been any bibliometric analysis of the state of the art in blockchain where Web of Science (WoS) has been taken into consideration as a literature database. Hence, a thorough analysis of the current body of knowledge in blockchain research through a bibliometric study would be needed. In this paper, we performed a bibliometric analysis of all Blockchain's conference papers, articles, and review papers that have been indexed by WoS from 2013 to 2018. We have analyzed those collected papers against five research questions. The results revealed some valuable insights, including yearly publications and citations trends, hottest research areas, top-ten influential papers, favorite publication venues, and most supportive funding bodies. The findings of this paper offer several implications that can be used as a guideline by both fresh and experienced researchers to establish a baseline before initiating a blockchain research project in the future.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the core drivers of industrial development and a critical factor in promoting the integration of emerging technologies, such as graphic processing unit, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and the blockchain, in the new generation of big data and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we construct an extensive survey over the period 1961-2018 of AI and deep learning. The research provides a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners through the multi-angle systematic analysis of AI, from underlying mechanisms to practical applications, from fundamental algorithms to industrial achievements, from current status to future trends. Although there exist many issues toward AI, it is undoubtful that AI has become an innovative and revolutionary assistant in a wide range of applications and fields.

TI The blockchain as a backbone of GDPR compliant frameworks
SO QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE blockchain; confidentiability; GDPR; Hyperledger Fabric
AB General data protection regulation (GDPR) is applied since 25 May 2018. It is designed to harmonize data privacy laws in European Union. It clearly defines what personal data is and identifies involved objects as Controller, Processor and Data subject. Although it focuses over the procedures in the organizations that have contact with personal data, it raises technological challenges about data storage, data processing, access control, identity management, system resilience, cybersecurity, post security breach measures, transactions traceability. We offer a new conceptual model with a trust management technology between controllers and data processors, which is based on the capabilities of the DLT. It can be useful in synthesizing software architectures, managing change due to the implementation of GDPR, ePrivacy, Policy Directive, and another forthcoming EU legislation. The article aims to present where the blockchain implementation can be helpful for the GDPR compliant operations. It doesn't cover the GDPR or blockchain in deep technical details, but just points out the important aspects where the DLT solution could be applicable. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the paper. Section 2 describes the methodology used in this article. Section 3 introduces the GDPR and points out with short descriptions the key principles of the regulation. Section 4 covers brief explanation what blockchain is with examples from the Bitcoin implementation. Terms like transaction, transactions integrity, block, consensus are described here. Permissioned and permissionless blockchain implementations with their basic difference in the level of trust. Section 5 defines the main intersection points between GDPR compliance and the blockchain. Section 6 presents the Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework founded by Open Linux Foundation and IBM. The section focuses over the unique Hyperledger fabric abilities, which leads to increased confidentiality, transaction speed, traceability, access control, identity management, endorsement policies and smart contracts applications. Section 7 shows related research in this area. In conclusion the study reveals the biggest challenge in the blockchain application in the GDPR compliant frameworks.

AB The challenge that journalism is facing these days in the Internet mobile environment is greater than ever before. Journalism is losing its revenue structure to platform operators favoring a certain markets, and also the trust of its readers in light of fake news and infected news. To alleviate this situation, we propose a blockchain technology that is applicable to journalism in order to achieve decentralization as a reasonable alternative. The journalism model based on hybrid blockchain aims to achieve the following: the delivery of articles with sharing value, what we call proof of sharing; the distribution of roles of personalized agenda settings; and finally, the use of agora to collect public opinions. With all these, we attempt to resolve the issues with current journalism with our proposed model based on blockchain.

AB The development of mobile internet has led to a massive amount of data being generated from mobile devices daily, which has become a source for analyzing human behavior and trends in public sentiment. In this paper, we build a system called MoSa (Mobile Sentiment analysis) to analyze this data. In this system, sentiment analysis is used to analyze news comments on the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) event from Toutiao by employing algorithms to calculate the sentiment value of the comment. This paper is based on HowNet; after the comparison of different sentiment dictionaries, we discover that the method proposed in this paper, which use a mixed sentiment dictionary, has a higher accuracy rate in its analysis of comment sentiment tendency. We then statistically analyze the relevant attributes of the comments and their sentiment values and discover that the standard deviation of the comments' sentiment value can quickly reflect sentiment changes among the public. Besides that, we also derive some special models from the data that can reflect some specific characteristics. We find that the intrinsic characteristics of situational awareness have implicit symmetry. By using our system, people can obtain some practical results to guide interaction design in applications including mobile Internet, social networks, and blockchain based crowdsourcing.

DE smart city; blockchain; paradigm shift
AB The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2025 cities will account for 60% of global GDP, and the number of smart cities will reach 600 by 2020. In addition, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), more than 60% of global GDP will be generated as digital income by 2022, resulting in a redesign of existing business and administrative models. As a result, within 5 years we will also see completely new technological advances at the municipal level that can greatly enhance our 'user experience'. We will be able to obtain services also at the municipal level that simplify and facilitate our everyday urban life. This process will be largely supported by the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology will have a significant impact on our city lives, economic life will undergo a paradigm shift and many local ecosystems will change for the better as it can provide free access to values and capital in a digital, secure and traceable way. In the future, for example, a Smart City will be able to raise new funds for its development through asset tokenisation. This study explains what makes blockchain technology cutting edge and what development ideas for smart cities can arise from it.

AB Aerial-terrestrial cloud networks (ATCNs), global integration of air and ground communication systems, pave a way for a large set of applications such as surveillance, on-demand transmissions, data-acquisition, and navigation. However, such networks suffer from crucial challenges of secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching as the involved entities are highly dynamic and there is no fine-tuned strategy to accommodate their connectivity. To resolve this quandary, cog-chain, a novel paradigm for secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching in ATCNs, is presented. Various requirements, key concepts, and issues with ATCNs are also presented along with basic concepts to establish a cog-chain in ATCNs. Feed and fetch modes are utilized depending on the involved entities and caching servers. In addition, a cog-chain communication protocol is presented which avails to evaluate the formation of a virtual cog-chain between the nodes and the content-caching servers. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated through consequential gains observed for signaling overheads, computational time, reliability, and resource allocation growth. The proposed approach operates with the signaling overheads ranging between 30.36 and 303.6 bytes*hops/sec and the formation time between 186 and 195 ms. Furthermore, the overall time consumption is 83.33% lower than the sequential-verification model and the resource allocation growth is 27.17% better than the sequential-verification model.

AB In view of the influence of information's "incompleteness" and "asymmetry" to supply chain operation efficiency, we make big production enterprise as the object and apply blockchain to its supply chain endogenous risk management, to research the specific operation mechanism and application value. In the operation process of big production enterprise supply chain, because of the information's asymmetry, the fraud problem will produce among the business subjects; blockchain is a decentralized distributed accounting and data storage technology, and with blockchain technology, we can resolve the business subjects' fraud problem and can provide more accurate decision information basis for each business section, and realize group decision. This paper has described the system structure and intelligent contract operation mechanism under consensus authentication of blockchain applying in big production enterprise supply chain and analyzed by the case. In view of the limitation of classical blockchain technology applying in big production enterprise supply chain, we constructed the corresponding blockchain data storage mechanism and data access mechanism. Analyzed the economic value of this paper researching from the aspects of response speed, supply accuracy, cooperation integrity, business interaction economic cost, supply quality, and supply price. This paper research will provide ideas and model structure for developing supply chain area's blockchain system and will promote the application research development of blockchain in specific area.

DE Searchable symmetric encryption; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Fairness;

AB The mechanism for traditional searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is pay-then-use. This situation is not fair to user because the cloud server may return wrong results. Besides, the user needs to verify these results locally. In order to ensure fairness and reduce user's calculations, we combined blockchain with SSE, and proposed a fair SSE scheme based on blockchain. Our scheme can guarantee fairness for both parties. That is, if the user is not honest, he cannot get right results from the server, and at the same time the server cannot get any information related to the plaintexts during this search process. If the server is not honest, except for the service charge, it will be punished automatically. Moreover, the user in our scheme does not need to verify the results locally. The security and performance analyses showed our scheme was semantic secure and feasible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This pilot study aimed to provide an overview of the potential for blockchain technology in the healthcare system. The review covers technological topics from storing medical records in blockchains through patient personal data ownership and mobile apps for patient outreach. Methods: We performed a preliminary survey to fill the gap that exists between purely technically focused manuscripts about blockchains, on the one hand, and the literature that is mostly concerned with marketing discussions about their expected economic impact on the other hand. Results: The findings show that new digital platforms based on blockchains are emerging to enabling fast, simple, and seamless interaction between data providers, including patients themselves. Conclusions: We provide a conceptual understanding of the technical foundations of the potential for blockchain technology in healthcare, which is necessary to understand specific blockchain applications, evaluate business cases such as blockchain startups, or follow the discussion about its expected economic impacts.

AB The relentless growth of wireless applications and data traffic continues to accentuate the long felt need for decentralized, self-managed, and cooperative network architectures. Enlightened by the power of blockchain technology, we propose a blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) architecture and develop decentralized, secure, and efficient mechanisms to manage network access and authentication among inherently trustless network entities. We further identify promising advanced functions made possible by adopting blockchain for open radio access networks. Our test results demonstrate the benefits of the B-RAN architecture. We also present a number of challenges and future research directions.

AB Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have become two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area. We also identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain technologies for AI.

TI Study of Blockchains's Consensus Mechanism Based on Credit

AB Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is one of the most popular consensus protocols of the blockchain. However, in the PBFT, the enthusiasm of reliable nodes cannot be stimulated effectively, and a large amount of communication resources are used for data consistency. Therefore, a new consensus protocol-credit-delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (CDBFT)-is proposed in this paper. The CDBFT works as the following: 1) a voting rewards and punishments scheme and its corresponding credit evaluation scheme are proposed not only to stimulate enthusiasm of reliable nodes but also to reduce the participation of abnormal nodes in the consensus process, and the virtuous circle of the system can be founded and 2) consistency and checkpoint protocols based on PBFT are proposed to improve the efficiency and flexibility of system. From the simulation results, a conclusion can be drawn, the participation probability of abnormal nodes in the consensus process can be reduced to 5%, and the efficiency and stability of the system are improved greatly in the long-time running.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous system connecting many different devices-the things-which can be accessed from the distance. The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) monitor and control the things from the distance. As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined. The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes the state of the art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance, and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for the CPS, which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions, work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable "Trustworthy IoT for CPS". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: a smart sensor infrastructure in the transport domain.

AB The internet of medical things (IoMT) is playing a substantial role in improving the health and providing medical facilities to people around the globe. With the exponential growth, IoMT is having a huge influence in our everyday life style. Instead of going to the hospital, patient clinical related data is remotely observed and processed in a real time data system and then is transferred to the third party for future use such as the cloud. IoMT is intensive data domain with a continuous growing rate which means that we must secure a large amount of sensitive data without being tampered. Blockchain is a temper proved digital ledger which provides us peer-to-peer communication. Blockchain enables communication between non-trusting members without any intermediary. In this paper we first discuss the technology behind Blockchain then propose IoMT based security architecture employing Blockchain to ensure the security of data transmission between connected nodes.

DE Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (CRVANET); cloud computing;
   blockchain; security; Software Defined Networking (SDN); edge computing
AB Cognitive radio, ad hoc networks' applications are continuously increasing in wireless communication globally. In vehicles' environment, cognitive radio technology with mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) enables vehicles to monitor the available channels and to effectively function in these frequencies through sharing ongoing information with drivers and different frameworks to enhance traffic safety on roads. To fulfill the computational storage resources' limitations of a specific vehicle, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is used by merging VANET with cloud computing. Cloud computing requires high security and protection because authenticate users and attackers have the same rights in VCC. The security is enhanced in CRVANETs, but the distributed nature of cloud unlocks a door for dissimilar attacks, such as trust modal, data security, connection fault and query tracking attacks. This paper proposes an effective and secured blockchain scheme-based distributed cloud architecture in place of conventional cloud architecture to secure the drivers' privacy with low cost and on-demand sensing procedure in CRVANETs ecosystem.

TI Convening Technologies: Blockchain and the Music Industry

AB This article traces the debates occurring in the music industry where blockchain technology surged as an ideal solution for long-standing disagreements over distribution, publishing, licensing, sales, streaming, and listening. The projections (in conferences, media, opinion pieces, and academic reports) started as techno-utopian, but over time the discourse shifted from "radical" to "incorporative" goals. The technological dreams were scaled back as the scope of social challenges to technological solutions became clearer. Borrowing from Clive Barnett's theory of convening publics, we argue that the role of the blockchain in this environment was not necessarily as a technological solution, but rather as a "convening" force that brought disparate actors together. Nonetheless, we still have to ask, who is invited to convene, and who is left out?

AB Moving the International Registry of Mobile Assets onto a blockchain registry system that digitally 'tokenizes' each registered asset would provide a more efficient and secure mechanism of authentication, mitigate existing potential liability in registry maintenance for the Registrar, and effectively eliminate many current risks of syntax errors and noncontiguous asset histories. This may be accomplished in accordance with the current legal framework, without complicating the user interface on the front end, and allows for potential future inclusion of the asset tokens into smart contracts.

AB With the recent increase in the number of IoT devices and the development of centralized management systems, risks in cyber space, including personal information phishing, malicious code infection, hacking, and DDos attack, are becoming major issues in the real world. The recently developed distributed data management technology, blockchain, provides reliability in transactions without the intervention of a third party. This new technology, blockchain, promotes integrity and reliability of transaction records by allowing for all network participants to jointly own and verify data, which was previously done by a central server. Due to distributed data management, the technology can reduce brokerage fees and construction costs, and guarantees high levels of integrity and security of data. This paper examines the effective identifier management using blockchain technology under the named data networking environment. The proposed system does not expose a specific user's identifier by creating a transaction using the content name of the identifier. The identifier can be safely stored and managed through such an identifier split management technique.

AB Financial Technology (FinTech) is considered a taxonomy that describes a wide range of ICT (information and communications technology) associated with financial transactions and related operations. Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including block chain based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation. The idea of adapted stochastic process is essential for the stabilizer, too.

AB The reward of the Bitcoin system is designed to be proportional to miner's computational power. However, rogue miners can increase their rewards by using the block withholding attacks. For raising awareness on the Bitcoin reward system, a new attack scheme is proposed, where the attackers infiltrate into an open pool and launch the selfish mining as well as the block withholding attack. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed attack outperforms the conventional block withholding attacks.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart connected devices have the ability to generate data that could be of interest to the public. This paves the way for an emerging market for monetized data exchanges, where IoT device owners can sell access to live data generated by their connected devices to interested users. Implementing a trusted, cost-efficient, automatic monetization solution of IoT data can be a challenging problem and usually involves intermediaries and centralised governance and management. Blockchain and smart contracts introduce a secure and trusted platform to carry out transactions in a highly trusted, secure, decentralised manner. In this study, they present a blockchain-solution and implementation using Ethereum smart contracts for monetizing IoT data with automated payment involving no intermediary. The authors discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, logic flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality.

AB Knowledge society blockchain is one of the most powerful and recent tools to make the internet environment safer and reliable. Manufacturing has traditionally been dominated by standard designs that are mass-produced, due to the fact, that custom production causes additional costs that make it less affordable than mass production. This paper proposes to develop a designer expert system for IoT installation layout designs, using blockchain distributed system based on a machine learning, with users entering data to the expert system by a smart bot software. This expert system will work using extreme learning machine as inference engine; therefore, this is a shell to develop any expert system with fast learning. The whole system is represented by a smart contract with a value linked to the value of the expert system, the more this expert system be quoted on the web, the more the shares of the smart contract will cost.

ID CONTRACTS; CORPORATION
AB All contracts are necessarily incomplete. The inefficiencies of bargaining over every contingency, coupled with humans' innate bounded rationality, mean that contracts cannot anticipate and address every potential eventuality. One role of law is to fill gaps in incomplete contracts with default rules. Emerging technologies have created new, yet equally incomplete, types of contracts that exist outside of this traditional gap-filling legal role. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that allows the cryptographic recording of transactions and permits "smart" contracts that self-execute automatically if their conditions are met. Because humans code the contracts of the blockchain, gaps in these contracts will arise. Yet in the world of "smart contracting" on the blockchain, there is no place for the law to step in to supply default rules-no "legal intervention point." The lack of a legal intervention point means that law on the blockchain works in a fundamentally different way from law in the corporeal world. Business organizational law provides a prime example of how the law uses default rules to fill gaps in an incomplete contract and how the law works differently in the blockchain context.

DT Article
AB This article examines an innovative junction between international investment law and climate change law with the potential to increase foreign investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, it explores the use of Blockchain (1) as a climate change investment vehicle, (2) in the collection of evidence of emission reduction compliance and (3) in the implementation of a Carbon Tax. Finally, it analyses the possibility to incorporate those three Blockchain applications to the network of already existing International Investment Agreements (IIAs) and describes a new role arbitration can play in the resolution of new type of claims.

TI Sustainable Growth and Token Economy Design: The Case of Steemit
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE cryptocurrency; blockchain; cryptoeconomics; ICO; token economy; Steemit
AB Cryptocurrency blockchain technology is attracting worldwide attention, and the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) is increasing rapidly. This new economic trend, called cryptoeconomics, can program human behavior through incentive design. A cryptocurrency-based incentive system is not only transparent, but also allows businesses to substitute initial investment costs with cryptocurrency tokens until they are on a sustainable growth trajectory in terms of network effects. This study aims to propose a process for building a desirable model of a token economy, based on the case of Steemit-a blogging and social networking website that is creating high values due to its efficient token economy model. We suggest the following design process of a token economy model: (1) Determine token-business fit, (2) determine the chance of success, (3) determine the properties of token, (4) give tokens intrinsic value, (5) establish strategies to raise token value, (6) establish operational strategies of token economy system, (7) establish strategies for token liquidation, and (8) continue modifying the operational base. Considering cryptoeconomics is still at an early stage, it is expected that the guidelines on the token economy model suggested in this paper will lay a significant foundation for the development of cryptoeconomics research.

TI Initial Coin Offerings: Emerging Technology's Fundraising Innovation
SO UCLA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB As Bitcoin becomes popular among the masses and blockchain technology is adopted among different industries, more people have been investing in new cryptocurrencies in hopes of making a fortune. A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses code to verify transactions via a peer-to-peer network. Since 2016, emerging technology companies have increasingly opted to conduct initial coin offerings (ICO) to fund the development of their networks rather than pitch to venture capitalists or hold an IPO. In an ICO, developers sell a new cryptocurrency, sometimes called a token, that allows exclusive access to their network without selling off equity or granting investors voting rights. Retail investors looking for the next cryptocurrency to make Bitcoin-level gains in value are investing significant capital into these tokens without the protections afforded by the SEC for similar investment opportunities. In 2017, billions of dollars were raised by these ICOs, and many investors were duped by fraudulent sales. This year, ICOs are on pace to raise over $10 billion.
   The U.S. government has regulated ICOs inconsistently. The SEC identifies most ICO "tokens" as securities, the IRS taxes them as property, and the FinCEN regulates them as money. For the SEC, applying the traditional Howey test to these tokens has proven difficult. While some tokens are clearly securities, others may not be, due to their independent utility as a means to access proprietary networks. Regardless, SEC warnings have not subdued ICOs. This Comment presents a new legal framework that meets the interests of the SEC, investors, and the innovative companies in the cryptocurrency industry.

AB In order to deploy a secure WLAN mesh network, authentication of both users and APs is needed, and a secure authentication mechanism should be employed. However, some additional configurations of trusted third party agencies are still needed on-site to deploy a secure authentication system. This paper proposes a new block chain-based authentication protocol for WLAN mesh security access, to reduce the deployment costs and resolve the issues of requiring key delivery and central server during IEEE 802.11X authentication. This method takes the user's authentication request as a transaction, considers all the authentication records in the mesh network as the public ledger and realizes the effective monitoring of the malicious attack. Finally, this paper analyzes the security of the protocol in detail, and proves that the new method can solve the dependence of the authentication node on PKI and CA.

AB Cloud storage represents the trend of intensive, scale and specialization of information technology, which has changed the technical architecture and implementation method of electronic records management. Moreover, it will provide a convenient way to generate more advanced and efficient management of the electronic data records. However, in cloud storage environment, it is difficult to guarantee the trustworthiness of electronic records, which results in a series of severe challenges to electronic records management. Starting from the definition and specification of electronic records, this paper firstly analyzes the requirements of the trustworthiness in cloud storage during their long-term preservation according to the information security theory and subdivides the trustworthiness into the authenticity, integrity, usability, and reliability of electronic records in cloud storage. Moreover, this paper proposes the technology framework of preservation for trusted electronic records. Also, the technology of blockchain, proofs of retrievability, the open archival information system model and erasure code are adopted to protect these four security attributes, to guarantee the credibility of the electronic record.

AB Emission trading policy provides a new approach using economic incentives to control the environmental pollution efficiently. Legal polluters can trade emission permits with each other through a trusted trading system that lacks security and credibility due to its centralization nowadays. Permissioned blockchain utilize a decentralized way to store private data immutably, providing new approaches to solve those defects of the existing centralized systems. In this paper, we propose a Hyperledger-based Emission Trading System (HyperETS) on the permissioned blockchain. Using Hyperledger Fabric as the implementation platform, HyperETS integrates the fine-grained access control, distributed ledger, and consensus protocol, aiming to provide credible trading service for polluters. We achieve the business logic by designing the particular ledger structures and smart contract in blockchain. HyperETS stores all transactions immutably in a chain and makes it easy to share the data between organizations. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed demonstration system.

AB Previous research studies mostly focused on enhancing the security of radio frequency identification (RFID) protocols for various RFID applications that rely on a centralized database. However, blockchain technology is quickly emerging as a novel distributed and decentralized alternative that provides higher data protection, reliability, immutability, transparency, and lower management costs compared with a conventional centralized database. These properties make it extremely suitable for integration in a supply chain management system. In order to successfully fuse RFID and blockchain technologies together, a secure method of communication is required between the RFID tagged goods and the blockchain nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust ultra-lightweight mutual authentication RFID protocol that works together with a decentralized database to create a secure blockchain-enabled supply chain management system. Detailed security analysis is performed to prove that the proposed protocol is secure from key disclosure, replay, man-in-the-middle, de-synchronization, and tracking attacks. In addition to that, a formal analysis is conducted using Gong, Needham, and Yahalom logic and automated validation of internet security protocols and applications tool to verify the security of the proposed protocol. The protocol is proven to be efficient with respect to storage, computational, and communication costs. In addition to that, a further step is taken to ensure the robustness of the protocol by analyzing the probability of data collision written to the blockchain.

AB Blockchain is defined as a distributed ledger technology that can implement financial models. An improved blockchain provides a democratic virtual economic system (DVES) that can verify payments, reach consensus, and store encrypted data in virtual economic systems. In this paper, we review the latest progress and possibilities in improved blockchain with respect to openness, data security, and scalability. This paper outlines the challenges of value, existence, and status (VES) and the state-of-the-art solutions for improved blockchain. Then, this paper discusses the VES in terms of distributed energy, ownership certification, infrastructure, and other fields. More importantly, it analyzed the importance of scale out, which can be a key enabler to solve the main practical problems in constructing DVES.

AB In proof-of-work-based (PoW-based) blockchain networks, the miners participate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition to win the reward by publishing a new block. Open mining pools attract a large number of miners for solving difficult problems together. Although the open strategy is likely to be more efficient, it makes pools susceptible to attack at the same time. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic analysis of mining pool strategy selection in order to explore the trade-off between the efficiency of openness and the vulnerability of attacks in a PoW-based blockchain network. We first model the pool mining process as a two-stage game, wherein the pools might decide whether to open or not and to attack or not. Based on the two-stage game model, we analyze the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability of the mining games among pools, which uncovers the pool selection dynamics of PoW-based blockchain networks. In particular, we find that the attack behavior is the norm for a weak pool and triggers lower expected utilities when punishing the attacks more severely. Numerical simulations also support our theoretical findings as well as demonstrate the stability of the pools' strategy selection.

AB Blockchain-based video streaming systems aim to build decentralized peer-to-peer networks with flexible monetization mechanisms for video streaming services. On these blockchain-based platforms, video transcoding, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming, is still a major challenge. Meanwhile, the block size of the underlying blockchain has significant impacts on the system performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based framework with an adaptive block size for video streaming with mobile edge computing (MEC). First, we design an incentive mechanism to facilitate collaboration among content creators, video transcoders, and consumers. In addition, we present a block size adaptation scheme for blockchain-based video streaming. Moreover, we consider two offloading modes, i.e., offloading to the nearby MEC nodes or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users, to avoid the overload of MEC nodes. Then, we formulate the issues of resource allocation, scheduling of offloading, and adaptive block size as an optimization problem. We employ a low-complexity alternating direction method of the multipliers-based algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI PBCert: Privacy-Preserving Blockhain-Based Certificate Status Validation
   Toward Mass Storage Management
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Public key infrastructure; blockchain; revocation mechanism;
   privacy-preserving
AB In the recent years, the vulnerabilities of conventional public key infrastructure are exposed by the real-world attacks, such as the certificate authority's single-point-of-failure or clients' private information leakage. Aimed at the first issue, one type of approach is that multiple entities are introduced to assist the certificate operations, including registration, update, and revocation. However, it is inefficient in computation. Another type is to make the certificate information publicly visible by bringing in the log servers. Nevertheless, the data synchronization among log servers may lead to network latency. Based on the second approach, the blockchain-based public key infrastructure schemes are proposed. Through these type of schemes, all the certificate operations are stored in the blockchain for public audit. However, the issue of revoked certificates' status storage is worth paying attention, especially in the setting with massive certificates. In addition, the target web server that a client wants to access is exposed in the process of certificate status validation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based certificate status validation scheme called PBCert to solve these two issues. First, we separate the revoked certificates control and storage plane. Only the minimal control information (namely, certificate hashes and related operation block height) is stored in the blockchain and it uses external data stores for the detailed information about all revoked certificates. Second, we design an obscure response to the clients' certificate status query for the purpose of privacy preserving. Through the security analysis and experiment evaluation, our scheme is significant in practice.

ID PROVABLE DATA POSSESSION; CLOUD; INTEGRITY
AB The idea of big data has gained extensive attention from governments and academia all over the world. It is especially relevant for the establishment of a smart city environment combining complex heterogeneous data with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Big data is generated from many facilities and sensor networks in smart cities and often streamed and stored in the cloud storage platform. Ensuring the integrity and subsequent auditability of such big data is essential for the performance of AI-driven data analysis. Recent years has witnessed the emergence of many big data auditing schemes that are often characterized by third party auditors (TPAs). However, the TPA is a centralized entity, which is vulnerable to many security threats from both inside and outside the cloud. To avoid this centralized dependency, we propose a decentralized big data auditing scheme for smart city environments featuring blockchain capabilities supporting improved reliability and stability without the need for a centralized TPA in auditing schemes. To support this, we have designed an optimized blockchain instantiation and conducted a comprehensive comparison between the existing schemes and the proposed scheme through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The comparison shows that lower communication and computation costs are incurred with our scheme than with existing schemes.

AB With the soaring value of bitcoin and frenzy over cryptocurrency, the blockchain technology that sparked the bitcoin revolution has received heightened attention from both practitioners and academics. Blockchain technology often causes controversies surrounding its application potential and business ramifications. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of information technology that keeps records of digital asset transactions using distributed ledgers that are free from control by intermediaries such as banks and governments. Thus, it can mitigate risks associated with intermediaries' interventions, including hacking, compromised privacy, vulnerability to political turmoil, costly compliance with government rules and regulation, instability of financial institutions, and contractual disputes. This article unlocks the mystique of blockchain technology and discusses ways to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain resilience in times of increased risks and uncertainty.

AB Blockchain technology represents an emerging source of venture capital crowdfunding for creative ventures, specifically in the music industry. Although music streaming is often portrayed as a success story, the Internet has in fact been something of a false dawn for the recorded music industry-particularly for emerging musicians. New music ventures might obtain alternative entrepreneurial finance through token sales or Initial Coin Offerings. Policymakers can play a role in developing this form of seed finance for the creative industries and beyond.

AB With cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based networks being increasingly used for more and more applications, a fundamental issue is now being noticed; scalability. In this paper, we conduct what we believe the first long-term assessment of the two largest blockchain-based networks; Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using historic data, we model how their growth could be over the next three years and proposed a model, a temporal blockchain, to reduce the network size and increase scalability.

AB Blockchain technology has gained significant prominence in recent years due to its public, distributed, and decentration characteristics, which was widely applied in all walks of life requiring distributed trustless consensus. However, the most cryptographic protocols used in the current blockchain networks are susceptible to the quantum attack with rapid development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. In this paper, we first give an overview of the vulnerabilities of the modern blockchain networks to a quantum adversary and some potential post-quantum mitigation methods. Then, a new lattice-based signature scheme has been proposed, which can be used to secure the blockchain network over existing classical channels. Meanwhile, the public and private keys are generated by the Bonsai Trees technology with RandBasis algorithm from the root keys, which not only ensure the randomness, but also construct the lightweight nondeterministic wallets. Then, the proposed scheme can be proved secure in random oracle model, and it is also more efficient than similar literatures. In addition, we also give the detailed description of the post-quantum blockchain transaction. Furthermore, this work can help to enrich the research on the future post-quantum blockchain (PQB).

DT Article
DE bartering; Blockchain; IoT; smart city
AB Blockchain is emerging as a promising technology that is able to support transparent, secure, and immutable transactions traceability in decentralized networks. Its usage in many application domains, including the Internet of Things, is gaining the attention of even more researchers and industries worldwide. In line with current research interests, the work presented in this letter has been carried out in the context of the European H2020 symbIoTe project. Among its main features, the symbIoTe framework offers bartering functionalities across a federation of Internet of Things platforms. This letter extends the baseline implementation of bartering functionalities and formulates a novel methodology that properly integrates and takes advantages from the Blockchain technology. Even if the proposed approach is general, the main facets characterizing the conceived approach are illustrated through a fictional use case envisaging the provisioning of Intelligent Transportation System and air pollution services in a Smart City.

AB Change is an absolute so long as time does not stand still. We should expect it, embrace it, and try to predict its direction. Dermatology, as a specialty practice, has been changing rapidly over the past 30 years concurrent with the changes in medicine. What are these changes, how did they come about, and what may be the consequences? The goal of this review is to follow the march of time, as we move from one era to the other in step with what is happening in the world as a whole and the United States in particular. The growth of our specialty, Dermatology, is divided into 3 eras which are quite different in generational cultures. The first era spanning the 1980s and 1990s is dubbed as "old school." The second era begins with the new century, 2000 until today. This era will forever be remembered as the business era, the rise of elite cultures, and the losses and threats to academia. The third era begins now; it is that of technology which is fast progressing into the future. One can theoretically project what may occur during this technologic revolution and the directions in medicine as a whole. Dermatology can be at the forefront of this era or it could be lost as a whole if we do nothing to keep up. These eras are based on my personal experience as a dermatologist in a large academic institution in the United States and may not apply to other communities or societies elsewhere. The United States serves as a good example of a western technologically oriented society that is often emulated by others. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The topic of Smart Cities involves various aspects of convergence and support to necessarily safe activities, which are dependent on reliable data and reliable sources. The answer could be provided by means of the adoption model of Blockchain technologies for this purpose, applied to the different characteristics of the city from the electronic governance, the contracting of products and services, and the sensing or data collection. The multiple IoT objects and the multiple networks, together with the Blockchain technology, may result in safer and more efficient cities. This paper analyzes and deepens the concept of Smart Cities using Blockchain technology as a platform for safety and reliability of the data. It is intended to reflect critically on this topic, looking through the different aspects involving this concept and the way in which it can implement. It analyzes the Smart Cities and its ecosystems with the generic data models, integrated, with quality data and trusted information.

AB This article examines the labor power of digital miners. Though an obscure and still incipient facet of the digital economy, crypto-mining powers and secures transactions across blockchains, or public distributed digital ledgers. Drawing from interviews with cryptocurrency enthusiasts, blockchain advocates, and developers; participation in online and offline discussions; and a survey with small-scale crypto-miners, this article takes on the material and technoscientific valuation of crypto-mining to understand how a future of open, decentralized accountability implicates human labor alongside automated processes. The work of digital mining, performed in the work of inscribing, registering, and politically organizing mining operations, enables the formation of democratic communities in the digital economy and remains inevitably embedded in social relations as a mode of productive, meaningful action.

TI Scalable Byzantine Consensus via Hardware-Assisted Secret Sharing

DT Article
DE Blockchain; Byzantine fault-tolerance; state machine replication;

AB The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their O(n(2)) message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.

TI Renovating blockchain with distributed databases: An open source system

DE Blockchain; Distributed databases; Blockchain application
AB A blockchain is a decentralised linked data structure that is characterised by its inherent resistance to data modification, but it is deficient in search queries primarily due to its inferior data formatting. A distributed database is also a decentralised data structure which features quick query processing and well-designed data formatting but suffers from data reliability. In this work, we showcase CHAINSQL, an open-source system developed by integrating the blockchain with the database, i.e. we present a blockchain database application platform that has the decentralised, distributed and audibility features of the blockchain and quick query processing and well-designed data structure of the distributed databases. CHAINSQL features a tamper-resistant and consistent multi-active database, a reliable and cost effective data-level disaster recovery backup and an auditable transaction log mechanism. The system is presented as an operational multi-active database along with the data-level disaster recovery backup and audibility features. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on the distributed ledger technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised have exploded since 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. The study's implications are multifold and discussed in detail. Importantly, the results enable investors to more accurately understand crucial determinants of the amount raised (e.g., technical white papers, source code quality, token supply, Ethereum-standard). This reduces the considerable uncertainty that investors face when investing in ICOs and enables more informed decision-making.

AB Accurate and complete medical data are one valuable asset for patients. Privacy protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no single party has absolute power to affect the processing.

AB The underlying technology of Bitcoin is blockchain, which was initially designed for financial value transfer only. Nonetheless, due to its decentralized architecture, fault tolerance and cryptographic security benefits such as pseudonymous identities, data integrity and authentication, researchers and security analysts around the world are focusing on the blockchain to resolve security and privacy issues of IoT. However, presently, not much work has been done to assess blockchain's viability for IoT and the associated challenges. Hence, to arrive at intelligible conclusions, this paper carries out a systematic study of the peculiarities of the IoT environment including its security and performance requirements and progression in blockchain technologies. We have identified the gaps by mapping the security and performance benefits inferred by the blockchain technologies and some of the blockchain-based IoT applications against the IoT requirements. We also discovered some practical issues involved in the integration of IoT devices with the blockchain. In the end, we propose a way forward to resolve some of the significant challenges to the blockchain's adoption in IoT.

DE Adaptive security; Reliability; Blockchain; Security level
AB In drone environments using batteries, it is important to reduce unnecessary overhead. Also, for security of data, encryption is also an important factor. However, in the case of encryption, overhead is generated, but encryption and overhead are always in a trade-off relationship in this way. In this paper, in order to reduce overhead of drone, the concept of reliability was applied. We applied low level security to drone with high reliability to reduce overhead and conversely applied high level security to drone with low reliability. In order to adjust the security level, adjust the size of Key used for encryption and reduce the weight of the security algorithm itself. The reliability of the drone was determined based on the number of times of receiving data and by applying group reliability through drone grouping, it was made possible to determine hierarchical reliability. Moreover, by storing the communication records of all drones in the blockchain, the integrity of the reliability is guaranteed.

DE Bitcoin; blockchain; fee; transaction-confirmation time; priority queue
AB In Bitcoin system, transactions are prioritized according to transaction fees. Transactions without fees are given low priority and likely to wait for confirmation. Because the demand of micro payment in Bitcoin is expected to increase due to low remittance cost, it is important to quantitatively investigate how transactions with small fees of Bitcoin affect the transaction-confirmation time. In this paper, we analyze the transaction-confirmation time by queueing theory. We model the transaction-confirmation process of Bitcoin as a priority queueing system with batch service, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. Numerical examples show how the demand of transactions with low fees affects the transaction-confirmation time. We also consider the effect of the maximum block size on the transaction-confirmation time.

AB Nowadays Blockchain technology has a great market visibility. The popularization of this concept can be attributed to the exponential success of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, launched in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The disruptive vision of this technology and the diverse possibilities of application in different businesses have been generating a series of changes and investments in the market, especially in the financial sector. The emergence of several Fintechs (Startups from the financial sector) that guide their software to Blockchain demonstrates the investments made to advance this technology. In this work, a bibliographical research was carried out in order to understand the state of the art of Blockchain and an experience of use was presented, where an application was developed using this technology, being source of information for the detailed definition of a software development process, based on Lean Startup, to support startups working with projects involving Blockchain.

AB Smart home systems provide a safe, comfortable, and convenient living environment for users, whereby users enjoy featured home services supported by the data collected and generated by smart devices in smart home systems. However, existing smart devices lack sufficient protection in terms of data security and privacy, and challenging security and privacy issues inevitably emerge when using these data. This article aims to address these challenging issues by proposing a private blockchain-based access control (PBAC) scheme. PBAC involves employing a private blockchain to provide an unforgeable and auditable foundation for smart home systems, that can thwart illegal data access, and ensure the accuracy, integrity, and timeliness of access records. A detailed security analysis shows that PBAC could preserve data security against various attacks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation to demonstrate that PBAC is feasible and efficient.

AB Now, the security and privacy-preserving of Internet of Things are receiving more attention. This article proposes a new method of Internet of Things security and privacy preserving by combining differentiated nodes, precision clustering, RSA, multi-signature, and blockchain. To calculate the node rank value in Internet of Things, the number of nodes' links is taken as the weight of nodes based on PageRank. This method increases the node rank values' difference between nodes. Accurate clustering determines the initial central nodes of k-means based on the differentiated node rank values, which effectively differentiates the active and inactive nodes in Internet of Things and achieve different levels of protection. To ensure data's reusability, we adopt the multi-signature. And considering node's incoming nodes have certain decision on whether data can be transmitted, we filter out two nodes with the highest node rank value from active node's incoming nodes to do 2/3 multi-signature which saves resources. We encrypt and sign the transmitted data with RSA, helping receivers to verify data. Data are transmitted safely through the blockchain. Successful validation indicates successful transmission. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between active and inactive nodes, which increases the difficulty of attackers' attack and effectively protects the security and privacy of Internet of Things nodes and data.

AB Internet of Things is widely used in many fields such as industry, medical care, education, and supply chain. With the participation of multi-authorized entities, a large number of dynamic data will be generated in the basic dimension of time. The operations on these data have to be safe and traceable for use in various forensics and decisions. Therefore, the key point of dynamic data security protection is to reject tampering of unauthorized users and to realize the process in evidence and tracing of the dynamic data operation. In order to find a solution to the problem above, an optimization of dynamic data traceability mechanism based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this article. First, a mathematical model for the security of dynamic data storage has been established, followed by analysis on honest behavior motive of individual node decision-making in group game and distributed node cooperation essence in specific industry background. After that, ownership transition function and the architecture of the dynamic data storage system are optimized; quality and growth characteristics of the system under stochastic state model are analyzed. Result shows that the solution can effectively avoid potential attacks such as tampering and faking under approved accession mode. The mechanism has good application value while ensuring the dynamic data storage security.

AB The recent emergence and use growth of cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain technology increased interest in the study of its economic dynamics and financial characteristics. Bitcoin is up to now the more widely known and disseminated cryptocurrency, with greater volume of transactions, market value and acceptance in exchange services. In order to contribute to the comprehension of the price behavior of the Bitcoin market, this study analyzes whether the historical series of prices of this currency, quoted every 12 h from September 14, 2011 to November 20, 2017 has multifractal behavior. The results of the research identified multifractal characteristics in the series and that both long-range correlations and fat tails distribution contribute to Bitcoin's multifractal behavior. We compared the non-Gaussian properties and the multifractality degrees of Bitcoin series with the non-Gaussian properties and multifractality degrees of several stock market indices scattered around the world. In addition, we investigated the power of multifractal analysis in the study of volatility and forecast for this series, pointing to a possible use of multifractal parameters in Technical Analysis.

TI A Bayesian approach to identify Bitcoin users
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Bitcoin is a digital currency and electronic payment system operating over a peer-to-peer network on the Internet. One of its most important properties is the high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified by their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of transactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, his Bitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin network. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them carefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions to the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments by installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the network to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation period we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their transactions to geographical locations.

TI The First Original Copy and the Role of Blockchain in the Reproduction
   of Cultural Heritage
SO PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The First Original Copy refers to any first true 3D facsimile of a digitally reproduced physical object. The notion of a copy being the first and original implies that it is unique and therefore the approach used for managing rights and ownership influences its value. Whilst virtual goods traded within virtual worlds are subject to rules and policies, the production of digital objects in the real world does not have a mechanism from which rarity and uniqueness can be guaranteed. Digital copies are subject to further copying and thus, the value of even an exact copy can never be perceived to be equivalent to its original. Through what means can we imbue 3D reproductions of cultural objects with value that is at least asymptotic to their originals? There may be a candidate solution. Discussed in this article is a possible approach for resolving a long-term issue related to authenticity, ownership, perpetuity, and the quantitative tracking of value associated with 3D copies. Blockchains essentially bring the systemic management of virtual objects within virtual worlds into the real world. This forum article examines the candidate solution by answering the questions above, and discusses the issues associated with the concept of the First Original Copy.

AB The blockchain technology is based on the proof-of-work principles. The essence of this principle is that some event (for example the bill-to-bill money transaction) becomes significant after the confirmation by certain computer work. So, a demand arose for such computational problems to work on, and we will spend for it about the whole blockchain system computing capacity. Now the main class of such problems is a hash-puzzle - the problem to find a bit string with a hash that satisfies some conditions. The major hash-puzzle weakness is the lack of the useful application outside of the blockchain technology. In this work, we offer some approaches to the Useful Proof-of-work for blockchains task, namely, we consider some practical variants of the NP-complete problems (tasks) that could be solved with the help of SAT-solvers as the proof-of-work computational problems. The use of the FPT-problems requires special study. The approach offered allows to provide the following characteristics of the proof-of-work computational problems: usefulness, problems complexity management (through the dimension change, choosing problems of certain type, the indication of necessary solution precision), mass character. Herewith we admit that not every solved task can be useful but we consider the opportunity to solve some practical tasks with the help of the blockchain technology. Among other things it is also possible to compare the virtual crypto-currency value (through the energy costs spent) and the effective result of the practical problems solution. The most complicated points of the described approach are the realization of the events-tasks (providing the computer work for these events) relations and the realization of the tasks complexity analysis system. This issue should be viewed as a research program because of many technical details that must be worked out further.

AB This article presents a comparative analysis of available solutions in authenticating access subjects in computer-aided information and telecommunication systems. Centralized and decentralized public key infrastructures (PKIs) are considered, and their weaknesses are brought to light. A blockchain model of decentralized PKI for access subject authentication in computer-aided information and telecommunication systems is proposed. The current embodiments of blockchain PKIs are checked for compliance with the proposed model.

AB Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms that restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation. This is an extension of work presented in Ref. [3].

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) realizes a vision where billions of interconnected devices are deployed just about everywhere, from inside our bodies to the most remote areas of the globe. As the IoT will soon pervade every aspect of our lives and will be accessible from anywhere, addressing critical IoT security threats is now more important than ever. Traditional approaches where security is applied as an afterthought and as a "patch" against known attacks are insufficient. Indeed, next-generation IoT challenges will require a new secure-by-design vision, where threats are addressed proactively and IoT devices learn to dynamically adapt to different threats. To this end, machine learning (ML) and software-defined networking (SDN) will be key to provide both reconfigurability and intelligence to the IoT devices. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy and survey the state of the art in IoT security research, and offer a roadmap of concrete research challenges related to the application of ML and SDN to address existing and next-generation IoT security threats.

TI Blockchain and smart contracts: the missing link in copyright licensing?

AB This article offers a normative analysis of key blockchain technology concepts from the perspective of copyright law. Some features of blockchain technologies-scarcity, trust, transparency, decentralized public records and smart contracts-seem to make this technology compatible with the fundamentals of copyright. Authors can publish works on blockchain creating a quasi-immutable record of initial ownership, and encode 'smart' contracts to license the use of works. Remuneration may happen on online distribution platforms where the smart contracts reside. In theory, such an automated setup allows for the private ordering of copyright. Blockchain technology, like Digital Rights Management 20 years ago, is thus presented as an opportunity to reduce market friction, and increase both licensing efficiency and the autonomy of creators. Yet, some of the old problems remain. The article examines the differences between new, smart-contract-based private ordering regime and the fundamental components of copyright law, such as exceptions and limitations, the doctrine of exhaustion, restrictions on formalities, the public domain and fair remuneration.

AB The paper analyzes the relationship between the most popular cryptocurrencies and a range of selected fiat currencies, in order to identify any pattern and/or causality between the series. Cryptocurrencies are a hot topic in Finance due to their strict relationship with the Blockchain system they originate from and therefore are normally considered as part of the ongoing, world-wide financial revolution. This innovative study investigates this relationship for the first time by thoroughly investigating the data, their features, and the way they are interconnected. Results show very interesting results in terms of how concentrated the causality effect on some specific cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies is. The outcome is a clear and possibly explainable relationship between cryptocurrencies and Asian markets, while envisioning some kind of Asian effect.

ID SYSTEMS
AB The adoption of machine learning and deep learning is on the rise in the cybersecurity domain where these AI methods help strengthen traditional system monitoring and threat detection solutions. However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby influencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases.

AB Networked microgrids are emerging for coordinating distributed energy resources in distribution networks in the future Energy Internet, for which developing an efficient energy market model is crucial for facilitating multi-directional trading among microgrids. In this paper, a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism is presented using non-cooperative bidding among microgrids. Multidimensional willingness, including time pressure and counter behavior for mimicking the personalized behaviors of microgrids, was taken into account in the design of the bidding strategy. Under a parallel trading framework based on a blockchain, the proposed multidimensional willingness bidding strategy turns out to be able to make rational decisions with sufficient flexibility in the bidding process. The simulation results of a realistic case of microgrids from Guizhou Province, China, validate that the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism is capable of raising the microgrids' profits and renewable energy source utilization.

DT Article
AB IoT is leading a digital revolution in both academia and industry. It brings convenience to people's daily lives; however, the issues of security and privacy of IoT become challenges. Blockchain, a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques, is promising for IoT security, which may influence a variety of areas including manufacture, finance, and trading. The blockchain framework in an IoT system is an intriguing alternative to the traditional centralized model, which is struggling to meet some specified demands in IoT. In this article, we investigate typical security and privacy issues in IoT and develop a framework to integrate blockchain with IoT, which can provide great assurance for IoT data and various functionalities and desirable scalability including authentication, decentralized payment, and so on. We also suggest some possible solutions to these security and privacy issues in IoT based on blockchain and Ethereum to show how blockchain contributes to IoT.

AB We correct the double spend race analysis given in Nakamoto's foundational Bitcoin article and find the exact closed-form formula for the probability of success of a double spend attack using the regularized incomplete beta function. We give the first proof of its exponential decay on the number of confirmations, often cited in the literature, and find an asymptotic formula. Larger number of confirmations are required compared to those given by Nakamoto. We also compute this probability conditional to the knowledge of the time of the confirmations. This provides a finer risk analysis than the classical one.

AB This study explores the determinants of initial coin offering (ICO) success, where success is defined as the amount of capital a project could raise. ICOs are a tool for startups in the blockchain ecosystem to raise early capital with relative ease. The market for ICOs has grown at a rapid pace since its start in 2013. We analyze a unique dataset of 278 projects that finished their ICOs by August 2017 to assess determinants of funding success that we derive from the crowdfunding and venture capital literature. Our results show that ICOs exhibit similarities to classical crowdfunding and venture capital markets. Specifically, we identify resemblances in determinants of funding success regarding human capital characteristics, business model quality, project elaboration, and social media activity.

TI Inflation Propensity of Collatz Orbits: A New Proof-of-Work for
   Blockchain Applications
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE geometric distribution; collatz conjecture; inflation propensity;
   systemic risk; cryptocurrency; blockchain; proof-of-work
AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin rely on a proof-of-work system to validate transactions and prevent attacks or double-spending. A new proof-of-work is introduced which seems to be the first number theoretic proof-of-work unrelated to primes: it is based on a new metric associated to the Collatz algorithm whose natural generalization is algorithmically undecidable: the inflation propensity is defined as the cardinality of new maxima in a developing Collatz orbit. It is numerically verified that the distribution of inflation propensity slowly converges to a geometric distribution of parameter 0.714 approximate to (pi-1)/3 as the sample size increases. This pseudo-randomness opens the door to a new class of proofs-of-work based on congruential graphs.

AB The problem of transparency in donation systems has long been a topic for discussion. However, the emphasis on transparency raises privacy concerns for donors and recipients, with some people attempting to hide donations or the receipt of money. Therefore, a donation system that guarantees transparency and privacy is required to avoid negative side effects. In this study, we developed a system that protects personal information by using a one-time account address system based on a blockchain while emphasizing transparency. The developed system could contribute to the creation of a sustainable and safe donation environment and culture.

AB This paper proposes the use of threshold heteroskedastic models which integrate threshold nonlinearity [Tong, H (1978). On a Threshold Model, pp. 575-586. Netherlands: Sijthoff & Noordhoff; Tong, H and KS Lim (1980). Threshold autoregression, limit cycles and cyclical data. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological), 3, 245-292] and GARCH-type conditional variance for modeling Bitcoin returns to provide an understanding on the huge volatility that Bitcoin has been famous for. Specifically, the model attempts to identify different regimes throughout the history of Bitcoin using the different available Bitcoin network characteristics, such as cost per transaction, number of transactions per block, number of active addresses and number of transactions. Estimation and diagnostic checks are performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In the empirical analysis, we show that our model is able to identify periods of crashes as one of these regimes, which is also a period of declining returns and declining number of active users. We also find that the number of users and the number of transactions determine the magnitude or persistence of a crash period.

AB The blockchain is a new technology that is breaking through in many fields, and also in the educational system. But it is not a specific technology which you can expect to improve a concrete situation: It is more a technology that allows registering events from an innovative form. And this can be translated into unsuspected changes. After presenting what Blockchain is and some examples of social uses, in the applications currently in use, there is an analysis of the problems to which the technology aims to answer. A review of the most outstanding experiences, all in an early phase of development, leads us to some critical conclusions about its viability.

AB Technology has become ubiquitous, it is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies (e.g., Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain or edge computing), smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, cybersecurity, design and science to reinvent technologies that can anticipate needs and desires. Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles and the development of conductive yarn. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, breathing, stress, movement, acceleration, or even hormone levels, promises a new era for retail. This article reviews the main requirements for developing smart IoT-enabled garments and shows smart clothing potential impact on business models in the medium-term. Specifically, a global IoT architecture is proposed, the main types and components of smart IoT wearables and garments are presented, their main requirements are analyzed and some of the most recent smart clothing applications are studied. In this way, this article reviews the past and present of smart garments in order to provide guidelines for the future developers of a network where garments will be connected like other IoT objects: the Internet of Smart Clothing.

AB The gaming industry has evolved into a multi-functional smart city that combines integrated casinos and entertainment (ICE). ICE logistics involve supply chains with various stages in geographically-distributed locations and with limited and complex storage and warehouses. Challenges are to leverage demands, traffic, and storage allocation in ICE logistics. The decentralized structure of blockchain technology allows all parties to participate in ICE logistics. Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model.

AB The Internet-of-things (IoT) and blockchain are growing realities of modern society, and both are rapidly transforming civilization, either separately or in combination. However, the leverage of both technologies for structural health monitoring (SHM) to enable transparent information sharing among involved parties and autonomous decision making has not yet been achieved. Therefore, this study combines IoT with blockchain-based smart contracts for SHM of underground structures to define a novel, efficient, scalable, and secure distributed network for enhancing operational safety. In this blockchain-IoT network, the characteristics of locally centralized and globally decentralized distribution have been activated by dividing them into core and edge networks. This division enhances the efficiency and scalability of the system. The proposed system was effective in simulation for autonomous monitoring and control of structures. After proper design, the decentralized blockchain networks may effectively be deployed for transparent and efficient information sharing, smart contracts-based autonomous decision making, and data security in SHM.

AB The Internet of Things aims at connecting everything, ranging from individuals, organizations, and companies to things in the physical and virtual world. The digital identity has always been considered as the keystone for all online services and the foundation for building security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, the current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on the digital identity management for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we firstly identify the requirements of building identity management systems for IoT, which comprises scalability, interoperability, mobility, security and privacy. Then, we trace the identity problem back to the origin in philosophy, analyze the Internet digital identity management solutions in the context of IoT and investigate recent surging blockchain sovereign identity solutions. Finally, we point out the promising future research trends in building IoT identity management systems and elaborate challenges of building a complete identity management system for the IoT, including access control, privacy preserving, trust and performance respectively.

TI A Consensus and Incentive Program for Charging Piles Based on Consortium

AB Charging piles are used for charging electric vehicles and are directly accessible to users in an energy internet entrance, while playing an important role in energy consumption. Currently, each enterprise constructs the center of operation and maintenance of their systems independently, along with their respective APP payment programs. This results in high operating costs, poor user experience, and low utilization rate of the pile, which limits the promotion and popularization of electric vehicles. To overcome this limitation, there is a need for a multi-center, fair, and transparent consortium blockchain, which can conform to the application requirements of a unified payment system and accommodate a range of diverse enterprise charging piles. In this paper, the design for a consensus and incentive program for consortium blockchain is presented. First, the application status of blockchain in an energy internet is described. Then, the logical structure and hierarchical model of the consortium blockchain are analyzed. Next, multicycle accounting and limiting the amount of accounting nodes in each round is presented to ensure the overhead of consensus remain constant. Finally, the accounting incentive mechanism and the bidding encouragement strategy based on "electric beans" are designed.

TI Blockchain: Issues in Australian Competition and Consumer Law
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF COMPETITION AND CONSUMER LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain is an emerging technology with potential applications across a wide range of economic activities and which will increasingly raise issues for competition law and policy. This article explores the blockchain concept from the perspective of Australian competition and consumer law. It considers the benefits of blockchain technology in light of the object of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and the specific risks of anti-competitive conduct that may arise under Australian law from the use of blockchain. It also identifies some of the challenges and opportunities that are likely to arise during investigation and enforcement action relating to blockchain-related applications.

TI Blockchain Technology: A Data Framework to Improve Validity, Trust, and
   Accountability of Information Exchange in Health Professions Education
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CERTIFICATION; ACCREDITATION; MAINTENANCE; CREATION;
   QUALITY; IMPACT; CARE
AB Health professions educators face multiple challenges, among them the need to adapt educational methods to new technologies. In the last decades, multiple new digital platforms have appeared in the learning arena, including massive open online courses and social-media-based education. The major critique of these novel methods is the lack of the ability to ascertain the origin, validity, and accountability of the knowledge that is created, shared, and acquired. Recently, a novel technology based on secured data storage and transmission, called blockchain, has emerged as a way to generate networks where validity, trust, and accountability can be created. Conceptually, blockchain is an open, public, distributed, and secure digital registry where information transactions are secured and have a clear origin, explicit pathways, and concrete value. Health professions education based on blockchain will potentially allow improved tracking of content and the individuals who create it, quantify educational impact on multiple generations of learners, and build a relative value of educational interventions. Furthermore, institutions adopting blockchain technology would be able to provide certification and credentialing of health care professionals with no intermediaries. There is potential for blockchain to significantly change the future of health professions education and radically transform how patients, professionals, educators, and learners interact around safe, valid, and accountable information.

AB Based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between 2010 and 2018, this paper identifies gaps in Economics and Finance research regarding two applications of FinTech: crowdfunding and blockchain. Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.

AB The privacy of patients is jeopardised when medical records and data are spread or shared beyond the protected cloud of institutions. This is because breaches force them to the brink that they start abstaining from full disclosure of their condition. This type of condition has a negative effect on scientific research, patients and all stakeholders. A blockchain-based data sharing system is proposed to tackle this issue, which employs immutability and autonomy properties of the blockchain to sufficiently resolve challenges associated with access control and handle sensitive data. Our proposed system is supported by a Discrete Wavelet Transform to enhance the overall security, and a Genetic Algorithm technique to optimise the queuing optimization technique as well. Introducing this cryptographic key generator enhances the immunity and system access control, which allows verifying users securely in a fast way. This design allows further accountability since all users involved are already known and the blockchain records a log of their actions. Only when the users' cryptographic keys and identities are confirmed, the system allows requesting data from the shared queuing requests. The achieved execution time per node, confirmation time per node and robust index for block number of 0.19 s, 0.17 s and 20 respectively that based on system evaluation illustrates that our system is robust, efficient, immune and scalable.

AB This study concerns the use of crypto-currency with specific reference to the situation in Russia. A variety of such systems exist; Bitcoin, however, is perhaps the best-known example and will be used as synonymous with the concept throughout this article. Our findings not only show how the views of Russian government bodies are formed and developed, but also sheds light on the specific innovative methods which legal entities use for development of the economy. Consideration will be given to recent developments within Russia which has been more active than many countries in seeking to clarify the status of Bitcoin and providing for the regulation of the technology.

TI Blockchain Securities, Insolvency Law and the Sandbox Approach
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Blockchain; Initial coin offerings (ICOs); Technology neutrality;
   Regulatory sandbox; Insolvency law
AB Blockchain is a new technology that is based on an algorithm which allows participants of an IT network to process, store and share data across multiple points without the need for any intermediary, at least in order to ensure the integrity of the data dealt with. This technology is simplifying financial marketsmany organizations are launching initial coin offerings to facilitate the financing of new business ventures; moreover, securities' that are issued in such a digital form can be bought and sold in the secondary market without the intervention of the traditional intermediaries. However, this use of blockchain could give rise to many problems which, in this article, will be analysed from the prospective of insolvency law. This paper will argue: first, that these problems originate from the fact that the issuance of blockchain securities is creating a divide between the world where securities are issued, offered and sold, and the world where law is enforceable; secondly, that these problems cannot be managed easily because of the lack of an apt point of attack, rather than because of the claim that the principle of technological neutrality should be observed; thirdly, thatunder certain conditionsthe sandbox approach that is being adopted by the UK financial conduct authority could contribute to directly shaping the platforms in pursuit of regulatory goals.

TI Crypto-Securities Regulation: ICOs, Token Sales and Cryptocurrencies
   under EU Financial Law
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have not only risen to public attention as novel means of payments, but also as facilitators of initial coin offerings (ICOs, also called token sales). In these entirely online-mediated offerings, entrepreneurs sell tokens registered on a blockchain in exchange for cryptocoins. Buyers receive tokens that can be understood as cryptographically-secured coupons which embody a bundle of rights and obligations. In July 2017, the SEC released an investigative report that highlighted that such tokens can be subject to the full scope of US securities regulation. It is unclear, however, to what extent EU securities regulation is applicable to ICOs and, particularly, whether issuers have to publish and register a prospectus in order to avoid criminal and civil prospectus liability in the E U. In conceptual terms, this depends on whether tokens are considered "securities" under the EU prospectus regulation regime. Against this background, this paper develops a nuanced approach that distinguishes between three archetypes of tokens: currency, investment, and utility tokens. It analyzes the differential implications of each of these types, and their hybrid forms, for EU securities regulation, and develops policy proposals for their regulation.
